i really liked this summerslam due to the look of the arena the curtains and just the look overall was interesting to me for some reason anyways this could have been one of the best summerslams ever if the wwf didnt have lex luger in the main event against yokozuna now for its time it was ok to have a huge fat man vs a strong man but im glad times have changed it was a terrible main event just like every match luger is in is terrible other matches on the card were razor ramon vs ted dibiase steiner brothers vs heavenly bodies shawn michaels vs curt hening this was the event where shawn named his big monster of a body guard diesel irs vs 123 kid bret hart first takes on doink then takes on jerry lawler and stuff with the harts and lawler was always very interesting then ludvig borga destroyed marty jannetty undertaker took on giant gonzalez in another terrible match the smoking gunns and tatanka took on bam bam bigelow and the headshrinkers and yokozuna defended the world title against lex luger this match was boring and it has a terrible ending however it deserves 810,positive,1
not many television shows appeal to quite as many different kinds of fans like farscape doesi know youngsters and 3040 years oldfans both male and female in as many different countries as you can think of that just adore this tv miniseries it has elements that can be found in almost every other show on tv character driven drama that could be from an australian soap opera yet in the same episode it has science fact  fiction that would give even the hardiest trekkie a run for his money in the brainbender stakes wormhole theory time travel in true equational formmagnificent it embraces cultures from all over the map as the possibilities are endless having multiple stars and therefore thousands of planets to choose from  with such a broad scope it would be expected that nothing would be able to keep up the illusion for long but here is where farscape really comes into its own elementit succeeds where all others have failed especially the likes of star trek a universe with practically zero kaos element they ran out of ideas pretty quickly  kept rehashing them over the course of 4 seasons they manage to keep the audiences attention using good continuity and constant character evolution with multiple threads to every episode with unique personal touches to camera that are specific to certain character groups within the whole this structure allows for an extremely large area of subject matter as loyalties are forged and broken in many ways on many many issues i happened to see the pilot premiere in passing and just had to keep tuning in after that to see if crichton would ever get the girl after seeing them all on television i was delighted to see them available on dvd  i have to admit that it was the only thing that kept me sane whilst i had to do a 12 hour night shift and developed chronic insomniafarscape was the only thing to get me through those extremely long nights  do yourself a favour watch the pilot and see what i mean  farscape comet,positive,1
the film quickly gets to a major chase scene with ever increasing destruction the first really bad thing is the guy hijacking steven seagal would have been beaten to pulp by seagals driving but that probably would have ended the whole premise for the movie  it seems like they decided to make all kinds of changes in the movie plot so just plan to enjoy the action and do not expect a coherent plot turn any sense of logic you may have it will reduce your chance of getting a headache  i does give me some hope that steven seagal is trying to move back towards the type of characters he portrayed in his more popular movies,negative,0
jane austen would definitely approve of this one  gwyneth paltrow does an awesome job capturing the attitude of emma she is funny without being excessively silly yet elegant she puts on a very convincing british accent not being british myself maybe im not the best judge but she fooled meshe was also excellent in sliding doorsi sometimes forget shes american    also brilliant are jeremy northam and sophie thompson and phyllida law emma thompsons sister and mother as the bates women they nearly steal the showand ms law doesnt even have any lines  highly recommended,positive,1
expectations were somewhat high for me when i went to see this movie after all i thought steve carell could do no wrong coming off of great movies like anchorman the 40 yearold virgin and little miss sunshine boy was i wrong  ill start with what is right with this movie at certain points steve carell is allowed to be steve carell there are a handful of moments in the film that made me laugh and its due almost entirely to him being given the wiggleroom to do his thing hes an undoubtedly talented individual and its a shame that he signed on to what turned out to be in my opinion a total trainwreck  with that out of the way ill discuss what went horrifyingly wrong  the film begins with dan burns a widower with three girls who is being considered for a nationally syndicated advice column he prepares his girls for a family reunion where his extended relatives gather for some time with each other  the family is high atop the list of things that make this an awful movie no family behaves like this its almost as if theyve been transported from pleasantville or leave it to beaver they are a caricature of what we think a family is when were 7 it reaches the point where they become obnoxious and simply frustrating touch football crossword puzzle competitions family bowling and talent shows are not how actual people behave its almost sickening  another big flaw is the woman carell is supposed to be falling for observing her in her first scene with steve carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to be rehabilitated what i imagine is supposed to be unique and original in this woman comes off as mildly retarded  it makes me think that this movie is taking place on another planet i left the theater wondering what i just saw after thinking further i dont think it was much,negative,0
ive watched this movie on a fairly regular basis for most of my life and it never gets old for all the snide remarks and insults mostly from david spade tommy boy has a giant heart and thats what keeps this movie funny after all these years  tommy callahan chris farley is the son of big tom callahan brian dennehy master car parts salesman and has ridden on that all his life but after his died dies on his wedding day tommy learns that the company is in debt and about to be bought by ray zalinsky dan akroyd the owner of a huge car parts company so in order to save the company tommy has to go on the road to sell the companys new brake pads along for the ride though not by choice is richard hayden david spade a former classmate of tommys who was big toms righthand man  the movie rides on the chemistry between the two snl stars and reallife best friends chris farley and david spade the duo has enough comic energy going between them to power the world its the big dumb guy versus the smart little guy it works and some of their scenes are unforgettably funny farley and spade are actually decent dramatic actors as well although the film is primarily a comedy it has its fair share of drama but spade and especially farley are just as good there as when theyre making the audience laugh  forgive me but i have to talk about chris farley a little more i read his biography the chris farley show a biography in three acts for anyone who cares and understanding who chris was in real life made this movie more special to me chris farley was a genuinely good person who struggled and ultimately failed to conquer his addictions although this was the first movie he had a major role in it is his best film it really showed who he was and just how much talent he had knowing chriss story adds another layer to this movie although it doesnt make it any less funny  farley and spade are matched with a good on screen cast rob lowe is suitably slimy as tommys new brother and bo derek is solid as his stepmother brian dennehy is great as big tom dennehy makes it easy to believe that theyre father in son big tom is just as crazy as his son although hes smarter and more mature dan akroyd gives one of his best performances as zalinsky giving tommy the hard truth behind advertising julie warner is also good as tommys love interest michelle  for me peter segal is one of the great comedy directors he keeps the pace quick and energetic but most importantly he knows how to make comedy funny he doesnt belabor the jokes and he understands that funny actors know what theyre doing and he allows them to do it but segal goes a step further he gives tommy boy a friendly almost nostalgic tone that both tugs the heartstrings genuinely and tickles the funnybone  critics didnt like tommy boy shame on them a movie doesnt have to be super sophisticated or subversively intellectual to be funny god forbid farley and spade were forced to do muted comedy a la the office this is a great movie and one of my alltime favorites,positive,1
for once a story of hope highlighted over the tragic reality our youth face favela rising draws one into a scary unsafe and unfair world and shows through beautiful color and moving music how one man and his dedicated friends choose not to accept that world and change it through action and art an entertaining interesting emotional aesthetically beautiful film i showed this film to numerous high school students as well who all live in neighborhoods with poverty and and gun violence and they were enamored with anderson the protagonist i recommend this film to all ages over 13 due to subtitles and some images of death from all backgrounds,positive,1
okay i didnt get the purgatory thing the first time i watched this episode it seemed like something significant was going on that i couldnt put my finger on this time those costa mesa fires on tv really caught my attention and it helped that i was just writing an essay on inferno but let me see what hasnt been discussed yet  a twop review mentioned that tony had 7 flights of stairs to go down because of the broken elevator yeah 7 is a significant number for lots of reasons especially religious but heres one more for ya on a hunch i consulted wikipedia and guess what dante divided into 7 levels purgatorio excluding antepurgatory and paradise the stuff at the bottom of the stairs and what tony cant get to   on to the allegedly random monkslap scene as soon as the monks appeared it fit perfectly in place with tony trying to get out of purgatory you can tell he got worried when that christian commercial death disease and sin came on and hes getting more and more desperate because christian heaven is looking kinda iffy for him by the time he meets the monks hes thinking hey maybe these guys can help me which sounds like contemplating other religions eg buddhism and wondering if some other path could take him to salvation not that tony is necessarily literally thinking about becoming a buddhist but it appears finnerty tried that and messed up that slap in the face basically tells tony theres no quick fix as in no you cant suddenly embrace buddhism and get out of here   tony was initially not too concerned about getting to heaven but at the conference entrance he realizes thats not going to be so easy for him at first i saw the name vs drivers license problem as tony having led sort of a double life what with the killing people and sleeping around that he kept secret from most people he feels free to have an affair with quasimelfi because hes kevin finnerty he figures out that he can fool some people with kfs cards like hotel receptionists but it wont get him out of purgatory those helicopters the helicopters of heaven are keeping track of him and everything he does  after reading all the theories on infinnerty though it seems like kfs identity is a reminder of the infinite different paths tony couldve taken in his life possibly along with the car joke involving infinitis that made no sense to me otherwise aaaand at that point my brain fizzles out,positive,1
i was very disappointed with this series it had lots of cool graphics and thats about it the level of detail it went into was minimal and i always got the feeling the audience was being patronized  there was a lot of what seemed to me as this is extremely cool but were not going to explain it in further detail because you wont get it anyway lets just show you some pretty pictures to entertain you the host would drop interestingsounding words such as sparticles and supersymmetry without any attempt at explaining what it was we had to look it up on wikipedia  furthermore i know quite a bit about superstrings for a layman and i found their explanations were convoluted and could have been so much better they could have chosen much better examples to explain concepts but instead the examples they used were confusing and further obscured the subject  additionally i got so sick of the repetitiveness they could easily have condensed the series into one episode if they had cut out all the repetition they must have shown the clips of the quantum café about 8 times the host kept saying the same things over and over and over again i cant remember how many times he said the universe is made out of tiny little vibrating strings its like they were trying to brainwash us into just accepting superstrings are the best thing since sliced bread  finally the show ended off with an unpleasant sense of a competition between fermilab and cern clearly biased towards fermilab this is supposed to be an educational program about quantum physics not about whether the us is better than europe or vice versa i also felt that was part of the patronizing  audiences need to see some conflict to remain interested please give me a little more credit than that  overall 2 thumbs down ,negative,0
the first 30 minutes of tinseltown had my finger teetering on the remote poised to flick around to watch something else the premise of two writers down on their luck living in a selfstoragespace bin was mildly amusing but painfully bland  the introduction of the character played by joe pantoliano  the big deal movie guy that lives in the park and sleeps in a lavatory offered hope and i decided to give it a few more minutes and then a few more until kristy swansons introduction as a budding film director  borderline nymphomaniac added a bit of spice her solid acting performance raised her presence above and beyond just a very welcome eyecandy inclusion  ultimately the obvious lowbudget impacts on the film with poorly shot scenes stuttured pace and slapstick handling of certain moments some of my favourite movies of all time have been low budget whithnail  i being one that also deals with 2 guys with a dream but down on their luck  however for my money the actors save tinseltown from the terrible movie archives and just about nudges it into the could have been a cult movie archives i laughed out loud at some of the scenes involving joe pantolianos character in particular the penultimate scenes in the terribly clichéd but still funny richbutscrewedup characters house where the story unravels towards its final moments  i can see how tinseltown was a great stage play and while the filmmakers did their best to translate this to celluloid it simply didnt work and while i laughed out loud at some of scenes and one liners i think the first 30 minutes dulled my senses and expectations to such a degree i would have laughed at anything  unless youre stuck for a novelty coffee coaster dont pick this up if you see it in a bargain bucket,negative,0
jeez this was immensely boring the leading man christian schoyen has got to be the worst actor i have ever seen and another thing if the character in the movie moved to america when he was ten or something and had been living here for over 20 years he would speak a lot better english than what he pulls of here or to say it in my own language skikkelig gebrokkent but it is cool to see norwegian dudes in a movie made in hollywood it was just a damn shame they were talentless hacks the storyline itself is below mediocre i have a suspicion that christian schoyen did this movie just to live the dream as he clearly does in the film by humping one beautiful babe after another,negative,0
great just great the west coast got dirty harry callahan the east coast got sharky burt reynolds plays sharky in sharkys machine and i enjoyed every minute of it playing a maverick narcotics cop in atlanta ga is just what everyone wants instead of suspension hes sent to vice squad like in the dirty harry movies or any other cop movies the captain is always going to be the jerk when i was a kid i was curious what that movie meant sharkys machine well i knew who played sharky i wonder what his machine was it was his group of fellow cops after uncovering the murder he goes all out to find the perp when it turns out to be a big time mob boss sharky doesnt play around when he gets the other prostitute into safety sharky fights back hard and good despite losing a finger to the thug and i also like the part where the bad gets blown out of the building through a plate glass window that was the bomb randy crawfords street life really put the movie in the right mood and the movie itself is really a great hit to me always rating 4 out of 5 stars,positive,1
its made in 2007 and the cg is bad for a movie made in 1998 at one part in the movie there is a stop motion shot of a dinosaur that actually looks good but this just makes the extremely amateur work on the cg stuff look even worse  the writing acting directing and everything else in this movie is just terrible this is as bad as if not worse than raptor island and 100 million bc pure crap again as with the other movies the only scary part about this movie is that it actually got made and is now being aired on the scifi channel  i still cant understand how they somehow get people who do have some acting skills to act in these movies and then somehow get them to act as terrible as everyone else in the movie  for those of you who are unsure the other poster is obviously being sarcastic in his review or he is one of the people who worked on this movie,negative,0
this movie stinks majorly the only reason i gave it a 3 was because the graphics were semi charming its total disregard for a plot and the lack of even insubstantial surface character development made it seem like just a bunch of nice drawings this is by far the worse anime that came out of japan i cant believe they actually put their names on this garbage what a rip off selling this thing for 20 if you havent seen this dont bother if you have i pity you,negative,0
we can start with the wooden acting but this film is a disaster having grown up in ny i can tell you that this film is an insult to anyone who is familiar with the community or the people im not even a defender of the culture in any way and found this to be a hollywoodized piece of trash to fit its own fictional ridiculous culture presentation and language that anyone who watches seinfeld knows is inaccurate this is a colossal waste of time and even worse is not exactly interesting since the outcome is obvious and the scenes of confrontation are laughably bad who acts this way nobody  the writers name sounds israeli or something of that nature but it is clear he doesnt have a clue about the subject he is writing about looking at his bio it is shocking he lived in new york and wonder how much real connection he had with the community even mediocre films like a stranger among us are better and more closer to the truth than this dreck reading this guys credits its no wonder he has written scripts on all c grade films that somehow feature stars shocking perhaps he knows someone because this script is even below par for a bad dolph lundgren film,negative,0
this movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end not that that is bad it was done to illustrate character trait degression of the main character consequently if you are not into tragedies this is not your movie it is the thought provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile if you liked dostoyevskys crime and punishment you will probably like this if only for the comparisons the intriguing question that the movie prompts is what is it that makes a renowned writer completely disregard his publiclyaproved ideas for another set the new ideas are quite opposed to the status quoif you are a conservative you will not like this movie   besides other philosophical questions i must admit that the movie was quite aesthetically pleasing as well the grassy hillsides and beautiful scenery helped me get past the slow start also there was use of coloric symbolism in representing the mindstate of the main characters if these sorts of things do not impress you skip it overall i give this movie a 7,positive,1
this is a slightly uneven entry with one standout sequence involving an overthehill gang reminiscing in the diner that once  thirty years previously  was their hideout one hohum duologue between two ageing rock musos a noirish kidnap turned on its head and an opening sequence plus epilogue involving heist artist wannabe edward baer and current hot property anna magloulis which has its moments no movie in which jean rochefort appears can be dismissed lightly and here he shines as one of the overthehill quintet indeed the film is worth seeing for rochefort alone but each of the sequences has something to offer and its definitely worth a look,positive,1
i was first introduced to john waters films by seeing female trouble on ifc i was disgusted but for some sick reason i enjoyed it then i picked up the pink flamingos dvd in the john waters boxed set the movie is about babs johnson the filthiest person alive who lives in a trailer in maryland with her obese egg obsessed motherand her deranged son crackers in the movie you will see such sick sights as sex with chickens dragqueens people eating feces torture and all other sorts of random humiliation the film has a soundtrack from 60s rock and roll artists the only problem is that some parts of the film seem to drag on and can get a little boring i found female trouble a little more fun rated nc17 for explicit sex violence and disturbing images enjoy,positive,1
this movie has very good acting by virtually all the cast a gripping story with a chilling ending great music and excellent visuals without significant special effects it is interesting to note though that like so much science fiction its predictions for the future dont appear likely to come to pass as early as depicted thats not to say were out of the woods yet but 2022 is now obviously too soon to be in this condition it shares this failing with a fairly illustrious list of science fiction classics 1984 2001 a space odyssey compare its space station with our international space station and isaac asimovs i robot positronic brains were to have been invented in the 1990s,positive,1
i cant help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten to be honest i saw the preview for this movie and the premise looked intrigued me yes i rented it after reading others comments they are correct in that some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired they are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of dr graves  also interesting is scott clark who plays grant the kid in the wheelchair i identify with the character he played perhaps because i am in a wheelchair  this movie is certainly worth your looking at,positive,1
the production quality cast premise authentic new england waterbury ct locale and lush john williams score should have resulted in a 34 star collectors item unfortunately all we got was a passable 2 star decent flick mostly memorable for what it tried to dobring an art house style film mainstream the small town locale and story of ordinary people is a genre to itself and if well done will satisfy most grownups jane fonda was unable to hide her braininess enough to make her character believable i wondered why she wasnt doing a post doctorate at yale instead of working in a dead end factory job in waterbury robert diniros character was just a bit too contrived an illiterate nice guy loser who turns out to actually be with a little help from janes character a 1990 version of henry ford or thomas edison  this genre has been more successfully handled by nobodys fool in the mid 90s and this years 2003 about schmidt i wish that the main stream studios would try more stuff for post adolescents and reserve a couple of screens at the multi cinema complexes for those efforts  ill give it an a for effort,positive,1
ive never really been sure whether i liked this documentary or not it was shown on channel 4 before a cut down version of revelations and is on the revelations video tape before the uncut show the documentary is basically friends of bill saying how great he was for an hour with video clips of the show mixed in a bit like a trailer for the film youre about to watch it also features david letterman grovelling like a worm for dumping bill off the his show before he died the reason bill made a joke about how prolife people should picket funerals and letterman had prolife advertising anyway look out for the video as revelations is bill at his ranting best ,positive,1
send them to the freezer this is the solution two butchers find after they discover the popularity of selling human flesh an incredible story with humor and possible allegories that make it much more than a horror film the complex characters defy superficial classification and make the story intriguing and worthwhile  if you can stand it definitely a dark film but also a bit redemptive,positive,1
this movie was released originally as a soft x apparently with the explicit sex deleted later the producers relented smelled money and rereleased it with the excised scenes restored apparently only about 3 minutes i guess since kristine was of age it was held against her and her promising career came grinding to a halt i guess its all in the timing witness pam andersons careerbut ronald reagan was in charge during kristines debacle we had not heard about nancy reagans affairs bill clinton and monica lewinski were in full swing during pams coming out  the sex is just icing on the cake both version satisfy this naughty musical is way above similar of others that were released at the same time,positive,1
with all this stuff going down at the moment with mj ive started listening to his music watching the odd documentary here and there watched the wiz and watched moonwalker again maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent moonwalker is part biography part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released some of it has subtle messages about mjs feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad mkay  visually impressive but of course this is all about michael jackson so unless you remotely like mj in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring some may call mj an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie but mj and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of him  the actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the smooth criminal sequence and joe pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord why he wants mj dead so bad is beyond me because mj overheard his plans nah joe pescis character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno maybe he just hates mjs music  lots of cool things in this like mj turning into a car and a robot and the whole speed demon sequence also the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene  bottom line this movie is for people who like mj on one level or another which i think is most people if not then stay away it does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically mjs bestest buddy in this movie is a girl michael jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty well with all the attention ive gave this subjecthmmm well i dont know because people can be different behind closed doors i know this for a fact he is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest liars i hope he is not the latter,positive,1
i went to see hamlet because i was in between jobs i figured 4 hours would be great ive been a fan of branagh dead again henry v i was completely overwhelmed by the direction acting cinematography that this film captured like other reviews the 4 hours passes swiftly branagh doesnt play hamlet he is hamlet he was born for this when i watch this film im constantly trying to find faults ive looked at the goofs and havent noticed them how he was able to move the camera in and out of the hall with all the mirrors is a mystery to me this movie was shot in 70 mil its a shame that columbia hasnt released a widescreen version of this on vhs i own a dvd player and id take this over titanic any day so columbia if youre listening put this film out the way it should be watched and i dont know what happened at the oscars this should have swept best picture best actor best direction best cinematography what films were they watching i felt sorry for branagh at the oscars when he did a tribute to shakespeare on the screen they should have been giving a tribute to branagh for bringing us one of the greatest films of all time,positive,1

the film is hugely enjoyable with a great cast and excellent direction by james eves the movie is entertaining with a very charismatic performance from stephanie beecham and everyone is perfectly cast james eves has a good eye for casting and directs like a conductor knowing exactly when to crank up the action fall and then rise to a climax he does this with an element of humour plenty of twists thrills and blood this is a return of the old vampire movie with loads of gore blood and screams the movie works at a great speed and the characters take you on a terrific adventurebut what makes it work is that the film doesnt take itself too seriously with plenty of tongue in cheek actiongreat ,positive,1
im writing this note as a chess player as well as as a movie viewer i watched the 1997 kasparovdeep blue games on the internet i know something about the issues that were raised other chess players will come along and want to know whether this movie is worth seeingbuying and im talking largely to them however ill try not to ignore those who arent into chess  this movie is about the 1997 match between garry kasparov and the custombuilt computer deep blue however the first image you see in the movie is not of kasparov or of the computer but of the turk this is an automaton which was built in europe at the turn of the 18th19th century and played winning chess against all comers i put the word automaton in quotes because it was as everyone now knows a fake there was a man inside it  if you dont like seeing the turk then you wont be able to stand the movie because the turk has as much screen time as kasparov maybe more both in modern footage and in bw footage from some old movie the reappearance of the turk every few seconds underscores kasparovs charge that deep blue had human assistance  that it was to some degree a fake computer that ibm cheated that there was a man inside it working behind the scenes to help it win not only does kasparov believe this but the filmmakers seem to believe it too and so this is not really much of a movie about chess games or about programming chess computers it is a propaganda piece about a big corporation supposedly misusing a helpless grandmaster really it is a lot like a negative campaign ad as it is chock full of ominous music and evocative camera work and spooky sound effects and innuendos we never found out what was behind that locked door and the everpresent turk  now most people in the chess community are pretty much convinced that ibm did not cheat and that this was garrys paranoia at work to start with in order for a human to help deep blue beat kasparov it would seem that you would need a human who was better than deep blue and better than kasparov since there was no such person the whole idea is a bit suspect from the start furthermore by the time this movie was made there were computer programs that could run on your pc that could beat strong grandmasters today much more than in 1997 we take it for granted that a computer can do things you might not expect and we are less likely to take it as a monumental human tragedy that a computer beat a guy in chess and in fact the bottom line is that kasparov beat himself with two bad mistakes including resigning game 2 in a drawn position   as for the chess games you actually see very little of them there are a few comments from masters and commentators that tell briefly how they went but really you dont get to see hardly any of the strategy or tactics at all naturally as a chess player i take this as a major shortcoming but i think that nonplayers are being cheated too imagine a baseball movie for example where you dont hardly get to see any of the game  just a commentator telling you that in game four the white sox defeated the astros with such and such a score nobody would make a movie like that but here for example we are told that kasparov made a bad blunder in the opening of the decisive game 6 but we arent shown the position on the screen or told why it was a blunder or what he should have done instead or anything we just see a few seconds of kasparov holding his head in his hands and then more atmospheric sound effects and camera work  since i saw this on dvd let me warn chess players about the dvd as well the jacket promises you that the extras include the games with analysis is this grandmaster analysis which people like us might find interesting no it is the automated computer voice synthesizer analysis from some version of chessmaster that tells you when a piece is attacked and a pawn gets isolated and that you are in the carokann defense main line blahhhh   someone might then come along and say well clearly this movie is meant to dramatize the match for the nonplayer and so its unfair to be impatient with it but actually it doesnt do a very good job of reaching out to the nonplayer either  it skates over some points that a true novice would really want to have explained for example it says that kasparov could have gotten perpetual check in the second game but it doesnt explain what that is or show what it would have looked like on the board which would have been interesting it flashes back to the kasparovkarpov matches but doesnt explain why there were two of them or who organized them etc i didnt need this information myself but im familiar with it if you dont already have chess experience there are places where you are going to be confused and this is just a defect in the film  ultimately i cant recommend the movie which like the turk itself is not what it purports to be a documentary but more of a stage illusion,negative,0

this film wont win any awards for greatness but if you have an hour and a half free and fancy a bit of light hearted entertainment then you could do much worse than watch this  the cast are mostly young and pretty the script has some genuinely funny moments and the soundtrack is pretty cool too rupert penryjones as jake seems to have the most fun while laura fraser as justine is sweet likable and funny  i rented it because i like the series spooks that rpj is currently starring in and here hes young and buff and the perfect eye candy for a girls night in  get some wine and some ice cream and have a chuckle,positive,1
if you enjoy seeing what must have started as a 2 hour movie in unconnected bursts of unwatchability youll love this film otherwise youll just wonder how they could have made such a film from something so simple to translate to the big screen as inspector gadget  in the previews for the film many scenes were shown which were not in the film and within the film some scenes just dont make sense while the movie is slightly less than 1 hour and a half i can only think of one truly memorable moment and that is just before or during the credits  ,negative,0
i clerk in a video store so i try to see the movies were about to put out each week i dont have a problem with this in fact i sort of feel its a privilege not so with this film    after an hour and a half of our hero whining and growling his way through scene after scene i was truly wondering if they planned to get to the point i felt like i should be getting paid for watching this at home in my free time and if id known there was another hour to be endured i might have given up right then i didnt care about the characters the filming was unremarkable and ford made kissing look like a chore even the score was incongruous and jarring what a waste,negative,0
definitely one of the lesser of the astairerogers musicals its just very poorly plotted and paced it only runs a few minutes longer than swing time for example but it feels a heck of a lot longer this is partly due to the secondary romance between randolph scott and harriet hilliard scott is rarely ever interesting i like hilliard shes sweet and i love at least one of her songs but where are you get thee behind me satan her other number is a weak leftover from top hat thankfully cut from that masterpiece follow the fleet would actually be a bad film if not for at least three brilliant dance sequences between astaire and rogers the dancing contest vies for the top spot of any of their numbers the dance is just fantastic im putting all my eggs in one basket presents the two rehearsing a dance that they dont quite have perfected yet its imperfections make it all the more perfect and lets face the music and dance is easily one of irving berlins best songs so the film is well worth watching for its great moments,positive,1
gwoemul the host  due to pollution in the han river a mutated beast goes on the rampage the youngest member of the park family is snatched by the beast and it is up to the rest of her family to find her before she becomes the beasts latest meal  firstly i love monster movies mutated bears oversized alligators packs of ravening komodo dragons the whole lot creature features are my favourite kind of horror film so i really wanted to like the host but it wasnt to be   there were three major problems with it  the first can be seen with a quick look at its imdb page  genre action  comedy  drama  fantasy  horror  scifi  thriller  too many damned genres it took itself too seriously to be a comedy and yet was too light hearted to have any real message though it did seem to be trying to make some kind of statement antipollution antiamerican or antigovernment the drama was misplaced and mixed in a confusing mishmash with all the other styles  secondly after the initial monster attack nothing happens for almost the entire film the central family wander about looking for one of their own while the governments of korea and america apparently do nothing and thats it they just wander about occasionally hitting one another presumably for a bit of comedy relief this lack of action made my attention wander and apparently it did the same for the director as whole plot threads go unresolved a mystery plague invented by the evil americans is completely forgotten about and is never resolved  and lastly the film is clumsily political it paints the americans as being stupid and evil but gives us no american characters with any more depth than a cartoon villain the opening scene has the most obvious stupid american vs wise korean moment with a korean morgue assistant asking his boss the coroner not to pour chemicals into the han river the american coroner all but cackles maniacally as he orders the assistant to carry on as well as being racist its lazy filmmaking and there is no excuse for that  on the plus side the monster is good kind of a mix of the relic and deep rising some of the movement effects are quite cool and the initial monster chase through the park is a lot of fun there are also some nice shots in the film some of which remind me strangely of the way firefly was filmed shuddering cameras out of focus shots etcthere is also a nice scene at the end where the hero and a little boy he has saved are sitting in the familys mobile food stall its nighttime and snow is falling the streetlamp is giving out a cold light but the food stall has a warm glow coming from it  overall i was really disappointed by this film id been looking forward to a decent creature flick and instead i get some pseudopoliticalhorrorcomedy lite looking at the comments on imdb i cant help but think that if this had been a us production it would have been slated just cause its a foreign flick doesnt mean its any good there have been some great movies out of korea in recent years the vengeance trilogy and brotherhood for example but this certainly isnt one of them   for once im in favour of a remake tighten up the directing improve the scripting and this could have been a nice film as it is its not worth a couple of hours of anyones time,negative,0
i confess to have quite an uneasy feeling about ghosts movies and while i sometimes enjoy the genre when it comes to horror but when it comes to comedies they really need to be crazy to be funny over her dead body seems to take afterlife a little bit too seriously and fails in my opinion from almost any aspect i can think about the story is completely unbelievable of course and did not succeed to convince me either in the comic or in the sentimental register the choice of the principal actresses was awful while paul rudd is at least handsome and looks like a nice guy the taste in ladies of his character seems to need serious improvement as eva longoria seems too aged sorry for him and lake bell seems too unattractive sorry again a romantic story without good enough reason for romance is due to failure from start jason biggs and lindsey sloane were actually better but they had only supporting roles the rest is uninteresting and uninspired with flat cinematography and cheap gags borrowed from unsuccessful tv comedies nothing really worth watching nothing to remember,negative,0
this was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it the fastmoving story an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths etc funny thing is you probably couldnt make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but white as anything else would be deemed racist by the pc police   nonetheless woody harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players is interesting as is his main counterpart wesley snipes  snipes had a lot of funny putdown lines providing much of the humor the bad part of the film  which doesnt bother a lot of people  is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters that includes woodys girlfriend played by rosie perez there are no really clean nice people in this movie for that reason i cant honestly recommend the film at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lotof profanity,negative,0
i saw this movie just recently and i said to myself this movie is bad william shatner is a great actor but he is no director   its not just that the acting is bad its terrible and instead of a plot we have a very bad storyline that is called a plot what i really thought was bad was at the beginning where kirk and mccoy were teaching spock how to sing row row row your boat  do i have something against william shatner i do not but when it comes to being a director he sucks this film is not one of the worst movies i have ever seen but it is the worst of the star trek series   i noticed that after this shatner did not return to direct another film in the series they apparently did not want him to direct another film again after this happened   overall this movie sucks   210,negative,0
with the exception of family this new season is worse than season one i cant imagine what they are thinking as a fan of horror can tolerate a lot of gore and mindless mayhem but this series gets worse with each outing i cant imagine how disheartening it must be for the actors and crew to go to work each day toiling to churn out such crap story is that too much to ask for character how can we give damn about the fate of anyone in these stories if we are not engaged who cares if they get carved up or whatever almost every episode ends with mindless blood letting going for gross out shock without any sense of revelation or conclusion or reason why we have been subjected to an hour of bloodletting even dantes effort this season had some disturbing sexist violence and wandered off to a pointless conclusion ironically the production values and performances tend to be up to speed while the content is utter crap i have great hopes for exec producers garriss valarie under the stairs but we shall see,negative,0
if there was some weird inversed oscar academy awards festival this flick would win it all it has all the gods excellent plot extreme special effects coupled with extremely good acting skills and of course in every role there is a celebrity superstar well this could be the scenario if the world was inversed but its not instead its the worst horror flick ever made not only bad actors that seem to read the scripts from a teleprinter with bad dyslexia but also extremely low on special effects for example the devil costume which by the way is a mustsee is something of the most hilarious ive ever seen whenever i saw that redblack so called monster on screen i couldnt hold my laugh back and to top of things it looked like the funny creature was transported by a conveyorbelt  do not do the same mistake as i did checking imdb seeing that the movie was released in 2003 had less than five votes and thinking well its worth a shot cant be that bad  yes it could  im not even going to waste more words on this movie,negative,0
though i cant claim to be a comic book fanatic i have read my share so i guess im part of the audience of this film and i wasnt disappointed it does run out of steam near the end its almost overflowing with ideas and it seems like lena olin one of my favorite actresses was left on the cutting room floor also a little of hank azarias blue raja can go a long way still its easy to forgive all of these faults when you have a film which is this much fun all the actors seem to be having a blast with their roles especially william h macy as the straightarrow shoveler and janeane garofalo as the bowler and unlike some i found the design of the city to make the joke even funnier i also liked how disco was the music of choice of the bad guys somehow it seemed appropriate,positive,1
it wasnt notable enough to be truly horrible it was just incredibly lame the story was not half bad but the execution was just horrendous  to start with it moved too fast for us to emotionally get involved with what was going on it was just paced badly the dialog was so utterly unsparkling just flat and boring  and the characters cripes almightly they made deadpool boring how the hell do you make deadpool boring he wasnt even funny he wasnt crazy he was just an annoying guy with a couple of swords he did not even know how to use properly  gambit was boring and since when did he have telekenisis to make the cards just float and fly around or super strength to leap hundreds of feet into the air and what the heck was up with all the stupid helicopter moves i mean we know they are mutants but they still exist within the realm of physics a round bo staff is not a helicopter blade you cannot fly by twirling superduper fast which gambit wouldnt be able to do anyway nor deadpool especially when using it as a replacement for real fight choreography  and this film stands as proof that wire work should only be used by fight coordinators who know wth they are doing and know better than to use it in every single shot as a replacement for real fight choreography  three of the most physical fighters in marvel comics logan creed and wilson and some of the worst fight choreography i have ever seen in recent film memory it was as if the stunt coordinator just shrugged his shoulders and left it all up to the special effects guys  and then you had the break out with all these mutants who did nothing even mutants who had been shown in their cells to have powers nice to see a quicksilver nod did fall when they got out only emmareallylameforthisfilmfrost and cyclops did something  and since when was logan so pretty and the stupid the bullet will take his memory away dont you think xavier and the xmen would have noticed the big freaking bullet holes in his adamantium skull when they xrayed him in x1 i felt sorry for liev schrieber man he actually brought in a good sabretooth considering the script he made one of marvels more simple super villains feel real but he could not save the film from its own epic lameness  seriously this was daredevil level of suck decent story good actors absolutely horrible execution,negative,0
this unpleasant film has little to recommend it dolph lundgren gives a performance that is better than either this script or his other action films have allowed and there are occasional snippets of dialog that suggest the film might have been able to provide some insight into a bizarre subculture  but no motivations are either murky or trite most of the acting is subpar the script creates needless confusion and the directors needless fascination with focusing on gore is distracting  its hard to imagine who the audience is for this film,negative,0
this is an excellent film with an extraordinary cast and acting i was very disappointed with the academy awards when this didnt get the oscar for best film and for best actress woopi goldberg it certainly deserved it in any case take a look at it i am sure you will enjoy it very much,positive,1
i too was fortunate enough to see checking out with peter falk at the phoenix film festival this is an extremely sweet character driven film that leaves the audience enthralled in the applebaums plight in life more than funny each character in the family contributes priceless comic relief that not only spurs laughter but inspires a few joyful tears as well peter falk was born to play this role he plays a 90ish young father of three who brings his adult children together in what could possibly be one of the most important times in his and their lives the 2 day journey that the applebaum family takes though the delightful backdrop of new york with carefully selected characters not only leaves the audience wanting more but nourishes ones own sense of family checking out is a must see film not only for all those who cherish family but also all those who dont my thanks to the director who took the chance to bring this gift to its audience robin sly scottsdale arizona,positive,1
eyeliner was worn nearly 6000 years ago in egypt really not that much of a stretch for it to be around in the 12th century i also didnt realize the series flopped there is a second season airing now isnt there it is amazing to me when commentaries are made by those who are either illinformed or dont watch a show at all it is a waste of space on the boards and of others time the first show of the series was maybe a bit painful as the cast began to fall into place but that is to be expected from any show the remainder of the first season is excellent i can hardly wait for the second season to begin in the united states,positive,1
when i saw the trailer for this film i said out loud to no one in particular this film is going to bomb i also said that about the matrix and look at what happened there now i am not a box office guru by any stretch but i usually have a pretty good gut about what is going to be good and what is going to really suck in this case i was blinded by my complete and utter apathy towards david duchovney let me put it to you a different way i dont like his as a person  from what i have read of him in interviews he is unbelievably premadonna like and he is full of himself considering all he has done is xfiles  or as an actor playing god was a really poor film but he came off thinking that for some reason he deserved big bucks on the big screen but i am happy to say that even though those things may still be true about the man return to me is delightful and has its heart in the right place bonnie hunt has directed a beautiful story and she has told it with class and grace this is one of the most romantic films i have seen and even though it may seem to be a bit sad and maudlin in its premise give it a chance and you will be hooked  it has to be said  and this pains me to do so  that the reason this film works so well is because of the story and the cast duchovney and driver are so wonderful and believable here that i honestly wanted to cry along with them there is one particularly powerful scene when duchovney comes home after his wife has died and he slumps down on the floor of his house as it always does the family dog looks to the door to wait for his wife to come walking in she doesnt and with his shirt collar still stained with blood rob  duchovney  tells him that she is not coming home ever he then calls the dog over to him and they seem to share a cry together the dog lets out a small moan and then rob cries and this is one of the most realistic moments of pain i have ever seen in any character in any movie you can feel his pain and at that moment i forgot i was watching an actor that i generally dont like and i felt that i was watching someone that i knew moarn the loss of his beloved this is powerful stuff  another strength of the film is the supporting cast bonnie hunt has combined an ethnic melting pot of irish and italian characters that share a common bond they share a pub called oreilleys italian pub that is a delicious name all by itself and heading the diametric scale of clashing cultures is carol oconnor and robert loggia these are two proud old men that love their homeland but love their granddaughter and niece  i think it is  respectively and that is the character played by minnie driver this scenario is ripe for comedy and hunt doesnt miss anything here  bonnie hunt and james belushi also share some funny moments together as the middle aged married couple and belushi gets top points as he accepts humility gracefully and shows off his ample keg of a stomach for laughs with his family consisting of three or four kids there is very little time for him and the wife to have quality time and again hunt handles this with perfect elegance   this is a wonderful story of finding true love knowing how lucky you are to have true love and the power of friendship and family return to me is a wonderful romance and even though i still dont have a great admiration for david duchovney i have to admit that he was perfect in this role and i could not picture anyone else playing his character he was sensitive and believable and the movie was good because of him not just because of him but he sure added to the flavour  if you are a sucker for a good romance and you want a good cry then this is the film for you   85 out of 10 i will see anything that bonnie hunt puts out with her in the directors chair,positive,1

wasnt sure what to expect from this movie considering its amazing collection of stars and directors but in the end it didnt disappoint  for me one of the highlights was the final episode with the american tourist speaking with a dreadful french accent which made me feel better about mine which was actually quite touching and a great way to wrap up the movie  the story of the paramedic and the stabbing victim was also very moving and for pure comedy the coen brothers and steve buscemi take the award the tom tykwer clip was also impressive although rather ambitious in its scope  however the bob hoskins segment was totally cringeworthy and the vampire story was completely farcical the dialogue in wes cravens section also felt very forced and the chinatown story was completely incomprehensible  on the whole this film is worth watching for the good bits and has a strong finish its not too painful to sit through the bad sections  they only last 5 minutes anyway  ca vaut la peine,positive,1

who doesnt love the muppets impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm fuzzy feeling inside so i guess whats important is that this movie seemed to very successfully capture what makes the muppets so special i dont remember much about the details of the plot but the various moments and characters in the film i recall quite fondly in fact there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without being selfconscious in any bad way refreshing for someone who possibly gets too hung up on meticulous details and technique the magic transcends all that other stuff tis indeed what movies are made of  so how does the film achieve these things hmmm nice question stumped am i lets see really i feel like its quite simple the filmmakers believe in their material and dont take themselves too seriously in the process i probably wouldnt say the film has many truly inspired moments but it does have a certain life to it that funnily enough a great many real people movies lack a zest you really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures they also have a certain innocence about them that makes them all the more endearing  generally i get the impression that the people that made the movie just werent afraid to try whatever felt right to them at the time which gives the whole thing quite a loose feel kind of like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session lots of talent little predictability and plenty of warm personalities coming through the cameos were of course a bunch of nice surprises for instance maybe i dont feel i have much to say about it because i was halfasleep when i saw it andor as i write this review anyway im sort of semirepeating myself here but i really liked the sense of family the movie had full of love i suppose you might say again a feeling of nostalgia comes to mind which not many films manage to achieve so effectively or effortlessly  and to repeat myself once more one of the films best charms is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere like the nathaniel hawthorne quote about happiness being like a butterfly so the muppet movie greatly succeeds partially by not seeming to try to do so same with beauty being best undiscovered or untouched or unforced or something like that anyway if that sounds sappy i also reckon it was pretty hilarious  so all in all this movie was very funny touching and difficult not to smile along to plus it features lots of great music highly recommended to all humans both the young and the young at heart,positive,1
once again bronsons talent is mostly wasted on this shock value 1984 thriller which uncut is far more disturbing than most of what is out even today the fact that the evil that men do is very disturbing in its verbal and visual depictions of torture is not the problem it is the shameless gratuity in which it is presented interestingly this film seems to symbolize that latter part of bronsons career in which he has tortured many of his fans with the same egregiously predictable and uncreative plots one hopes this fine actor will rise again,negative,0
this anime is a mustsee for fans of evangelion its an earlier work of anno hideaki but his unrestrained dramatic style is quite in place also those who didnt like evangelion might find this release to bit slightly more palatable gunbuster is rather unique to scifi anime in that its actually based on real science in fact the show has several little science lesson interludes explaining the physics behind some of the events in the movie one of the big dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time at speeds near that of light the series does a wonderful job of dealing with the imaginably traumatic experience of leaving earth on a six month mission traveling near the speed of light and returning to an earth where ten years have passed the main character remains age 17 or 18 throughout the entire series while almost all of the other characters age considerably be warned this show is heavy on the sap at times it also has a couple of the most wholly unmerited breast shots that i have ever seen i found it fairly easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boohoo scenes because the series is otherwise very good but viewers with a low sap tolerance might want to stay away from this one on an interesting note gainax as always managed to run out of money in the last couple of episodes however they managed to use black and white film and still action sketches to produce a good resolution anyway the ending is a bit silly but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut i couldnt help but love it gunbuster is in my opinion one of the finest pieces of anime around,positive,1
im sorry but this is such a bad movie its hilarious football hooligans arguing in a travel lodge suits shades alan clearly had no idea what he was talking about when he made this it is as far from the truth as you can get  the casting was atrociousgary oldman as a football hooligan he doesnt look scary act scary or even come across as someone who would like football and as for yeti what the hell suits shades and sitting in a travelodge childishly taunting each other with its about time you got your nappy on please  and the yetis gang spraying the iccs underwear   i dont see how anyone can even take this film seriously  410 its possibly the most inaccurate portrayal of the crisis of the late eighties hooliganism i have ever seen,negative,0
i dont think ive really ever given walter matthau his due as a comedic performer hes certainly been wonderful in plenty of lighthearted roles but i guess i always put his success down to his characters grumpiness and ruthlessness a gruff contrast to the flamboyant personality of his frequent costar jack lemmon and i suppose a natural extension of his earlier work in dramatic pictures watching gene saks the odd couple 1968 adapted from a popular neil simon play the realisation suddenly clicked matthau is in his own right absolutely hilarious initially striking the audience as filthy crude and generally unappealing his oscar madison eventually manages to worm his way into our hearts culminating in a hilariously overplayed confession of emotions that matthau rasps out in a voice not entirely his own at the same time while holding his own as a comedian his interplay with lemmon is of course pitchperfect indeed the film rightly belongs to both actors who have never failed to light up the cinema screen by themselves let alone together  calling to mind billy wilders screenplay for the apartment 1960 this neil simon comedy builds itself around around a rather morbid premise compulsive housecleaner felix unger lemmon having just been evicted by his wife of twelve years attempts to commit suicide but fruitlessly abandons the idea after he wrecks his back trying to open the hotel window dejected he arrives at the house of good friend oscar matthau a divorced slob who lives alone on a diet of potato crisps and green sandwiches that might contain either very new cheese or very old meat oscar kindly offers felix a place to stay but is soon overwhelmed by his friends finicky personality and constant insistence on absolute cleanliness the pair form an unusual sort of marital arrangement with felix assuming the role of the effeminate and constantlynagging wife and oscar as the sloppy unappreciative husband who always comes home later than hes supposed to this is a marriage that barely lasts three weeks and by the end of it we can completely sympathise with felixs exwife who remains unseen  the odd couple is a terrific comedy most of all because it has a lot of heart for all their arguing its obvious that the two roommates have plenty of affection for each other most movingly seen when felix tries to launch into a furious tirade instead  perhaps inadvertently  ending up informing oscar how tops he his the pairs four poker buddies john fiedler herb edelman david sheiner and larry haines are also constantly badgering each other about some obscure annoyance but you cant deny that theyve got the best of intentions their decision to treat felix as though nothing has happened to him may have sounded fine in theory but maybe being ignored wasnt quite the correct solution to felixs gloomy feelings of inadequacy and inconsequentiality unlike some comedies based on popular stage plays i was recently disappointed by wilders the seven year itch 1955 this film doesnt simply strike at the same chord throughout and the relationship between the two leads is progressively developed through tears laughter and much disagreement,positive,1
this is one of the silliest movies i have ever had the misfortune to watch i should have expected it after seeing the first two but i keep getting suckered into these types of movies with the idea of maybe they did it right this time nope  not even close  where do i begin how about with the special effects to give you an idea of what passes for sfx in this movie at one point a soldier is shooting at a raptor as it runs down a hallway even with less than a second of screen time the viewer can easily see that it is just a man with a tail apparently taped to him running around bad bad bad bad  how about the acting if thats what you can call it there is one character who i suppose is supposed to be from the south however after living in the south for six years now i have never heard this way of talking perhaps he has some sort of weird disability  the inability to talk normally i find it fascinating that the character does nothing that requires him to have that accent  therefore there was no reason for the actor to try to do one  how about the plot its pretty basic  raptors escape people with guns must hunt them down im starting to wonder why the dinosaurs in these movies always seem to run into the nearest system of tunnels wouldnt they stay outside to hunt prey oh well at least they have the good sense to appear very very little in the movie which supposedly revolves around them  other things  lets say you are in a building and you know that there are man eating raptors running around in it would you decide to take time out to have an argument about who is better  army or marine and then decide to have an arm wrestling contest to settle it how about the idiotic idea that they have to track down the raptors  split up into groups of two didnt they ever watch any horror movies or at least an episode of scooby doo in short this is one of the dumber movies out there miss it unless you want to groan your way through a movie,negative,0
a remake of the 1916 silent film based on the 1909 novel by maurice leblanc the detective series would be made into numerous plays films and tv series in the uk the us and france over the years this 1932 version starred the smashing barrymore brothers john as the duke and lionel as detective guerchard they would also star together in grand hotel dinner at eight and several others over the next couple years sonia karen morley shows up in the dukes bed during a party in this prehayes code film first the lights go out in the bedroom then they go out in the main ballroom then the search is on for the crook and the missing jewelry as well as other missing valuables you can tell talkies hadnt been around too long as they still use caption cards several times also watch for a new kind of safe that doesnt need a combination wellthought out plot no big holes but no big surprises here either not bad for an early talkie film clever ending,positive,1
although this series and the mini film in particular were very important at the time of release i feel that the series as a whole was actually fairly poorly written with a weak cast the issues at heart are extremely well portrayed yet it is difficult to relate and understand the problems within the film when the acting and script isnt convincing enough especially when looking at the mini film  i also dont believe that this mini film or series has stood the test of time as now many of the scenes are quite laughable the issues are still crucial but boys from the blackstuff cannot fully aid the cause of understanding the problems in britain in the 1980s,negative,0
ive got as much testosterone as the next bloke and raquel welch at her finest is certainly worth a look but the fact is that a cardboard cutout could act better and an hour and half of ms w showing off her considerable assets does not a movie make  considering the cast its surprising that its as bad as it is ive never been a big fan of wagner and his tough guy harry is about as convincing as a 9dollar bill godfrey cambridge and vittorio de sica both of whom i usually enjoy seem to be sleeping through their lines and as for edward gwell i can only assume he was there for the paycheck  this film is a mess from nonexistent plot through stopstart action and unfunny script to puerile slapstick and annoying 60s caper music if it werent for miss welch id have given it a 0  that said she is a treat to the eyes  even better than her delicious cameo in bedazzled  and for that reason alone i gave it a 3,negative,0

as a longtime fan of all the star trek seriesi found this a disappointing episode and i wonder if the liberal use of flashbacks featuring will rikers exploits both positive and largely romantic and negative lots of pain and a crewmates deathwas a moneysaving device as were many of their bottle shows episodes in which all scenes take place on the enterprise diana muldaurwho also appeared at least twice on the original series deserved a better final appearance than this for her character dr kate pulaski loyal viewers in the star trek world is there any other kind also were shortchanged this was the last episode of second season thus the season ended not with a bang but with a whimper,negative,0
hammerhead is a combination between the mad scientist and killer shark movie genres in a bit of typecasting jeffrey combs plays the aforementioned mad scientist who develops a humanhammerhead shark creature bizarrely this being is in fact his son who he has turned into this monster to prevent him dying from cancer or something  a group of associates are invited to the scientists private island they end up being used as shark bait or shark mate for some unknown reason the head of it has been brought along as part of this team who knows why luckily he turns out to be a resourceful if somewhat overweight ramboesque hero im working on the assumption that he learnt how to handle an assault rifle as part of his day job working in 1st line support a normal day for this it man presumably involves fixing someones network connection followed by a call to gun down guntoting evildoers or perhaps a call to fix someones pc has to be scheduled between physical confrontations with landbased humanshark hybrids anyway hes amazing and saves the day he even gets the girl  the sharkman is a slightly lame creation but ok i guess judging by the effects in general in this film and the movie moves on at a decent pace its complete hokum of course but if you buy a movie called hammerhead and expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts experienced by a man turned into a landbased killer fish then really you have no one to blame but yourself as it is there are guns gore girls and possibly even an exploding helicopter its rubbish but not as bad as some might say,negative,0
in fact parts of it i liked a lot it had some interesting twists but it just left me with a been there seen that feeling after all of the saw movies granted the ending was different from a typical saw but lets face ita group of guys unknown to each other or so they believe tossed together in an abandoned chemical factory  but then it loses something theres no intensity theres poor group dynamic theres no sense of urgency  some nice twists at the end and definitely worth a watch if theres nothing else on your plate but it just left me emptyit passed the time but it didnt satisfy,negative,0
the garden of allah was one of the first feature length 3strip technicolor films to correct a previous poster the first technicolor feature after disneys 5year exclusivity deal was 1935s becky sharp which was a costume drama that used the color for its garish color costumes  the garden of allah looks as if it could have been shot years later as the cinematography uses not only the color but also the use of shadows it must have been amazing for an audiences at the time to see a color feature after seeing basically only black and white films for their whole life unfortunately the film does not stand up to the cinematography that being said the film is worth seeing just as a visual treat,positive,1
its awesome in story mode your going from punk to pro you have to complete goals that involve skating driving and walking you create your own skater and give it a name and you can make it look stupid or realistic you are with your friend eric throughout the game until he betrays you and gets you kicked off of the skateboard teamyou can pick a team to be on and you then start your own team there are many levels like new jersey manhattan and even school iinot part of story mode though from tony hawks pro skater 2 you can unlock secret skaters like iron man gene simmons and another skater you can create your own goals like skate letters combo letters tricktris gap and much more you can create the goal pedestrian and write what they speak if you get bored of doing that you can do the premade goals in premade parks the only thing i didnt like about this game was that sometimes it was hard to drive the cars 910,positive,1
theres a part of me that would like to give this movie a high rating considering that it was made in 1953 this is a very courageous movie about transvestites tackling the issue fairly seriously and sympathetically and offering the viewer a lot of information on the subject and trying very hard not to stereotype the movie clearly makes the point that transvestites are not homosexuals and that aside from wearing womens clothing they lead a relatively normal life it deals with the pain of not being accepted in society  the plot revolves around a police officer lyle talbot desperately trying to understand the issue because of the recent suicide of a transvestite so you have to give everyone involved with this movie credit for taking on such a controversial in the context of 1953 subject  having said all that im also sorry to say that this movie is absolutely dreadful in trying to portray glenglendas edward d wood pain the movie falls into silly and at times surprisingly  again given the era  sensual fantasies that make the story very hard to follow the acting is wooden at best none of the dialogue comes across as real the actors look and sound like people reading speeches written by others and  worst of all  there was no point to having bela lugosi in this movie this was another of the increasingly embarrassing roles this poor man took on in the latter stages of his career pull the strings pull the strings poor lugosis character called the spirit in the credits but really coming across as more of a mad scientist kept crying and nothing he did really seemed to have much connection with the rest of the movie  for artistic merit the movie doesnt really deserve much more than 110 however for the courage involved in just putting it out ill give it a 310,negative,0
this is a very sad movie really nothing happens in this movie the script is bad i guess theyve just copypaste the first 15 pages to 90 pages the producers must have thought lets create a hollywood movie here in belgium they didnt succeed now in the third week it is only running in antwerp and brussels at 22h45 or something in the past we have had really good movies in belgium like daens shades is a waste of your time maybe you could sneak in the theater after youve seen a real movie if youve seen 10 minutes of shades youve seen it all it was advertised to death on local radio and tv i hope it will disappear in the shades soon,negative,0
i should have known when i heard anne rice left the project that the movie would disappoint me i couldnt have predicted that years after its release just thinking about the movie still makes me angry the novels are amazing and while i understand much gets lost in the translation to screen this movie was a great big middle finger to her original work i hope one day someone tries again the right way starting with the vampire lestat they change the roles and looks of major and minor characters alike for no good reason they destroy lestats history the acting of the queen is exaggerated to the point of comedy but i just cant bring myself to laugh the charm and allure of the novels just isnt there the movie is a bad excuse to cram as many musicians and dark imagery as possible into one movie hoping the teeny goths of america would lap it up part of the appeal of the first movie of louis story is that he is caught between his humanity and his curse lestat is supposed to take over and display the magic and excitement of the vampire world thank goodness i read the books first or id have never touched them after this movie,negative,0
ok imagine that every state in the us nay every country has exactly the same trees growing and ground foliage imagine also that a monkeytrappers camp so far off the beaten track you had to do the first half of the approach by river has a beautifully tarmacd perfectly straight road leading up to it imagine a world where you have to wear a full biohazard suit to collect a floppy disk then you just drop it in a ziploc bag and transfer it to your pocket with no precautions as soon as you get back to the office a world where two nineyear old girls are happy to give lots of blood without complaining this is the world this movie is set in  on top of that its one of the most clichéridden pieces of excrement its been my misfortune to witness in many a year  i liked it ,negative,0
first of all i would like to point out that this film has absolutely nothing to see with the dutch folklore story of the ghost ship that is also called the flying dutchman in this film you will not see a single sailing boat you will not see sailors ghosts or anything remotely exciting it is not the story of the ghost ship and i wish they had notified it in the main credits or i wouldnt have watched it because i really thought it was the film about the legend it seems many people think the film has to do with the legend of the ghost ship since the film is listed on the wikipedia page for the flying dutchman legend i dont understand why it is maybe based on the resembling legend called the wandering jew or maybe did they just adapt the worst parts of the legend the film begins with a fight sequence that would let anyone hope the film will have battle scenes unfortunately it is the only battle scene of the film then you see daniel emilfork who was krank in city of lost children for about two seconds and that would let anyone hope the film will have good acting unfortunately he is very bad in the film the same thing can be said about italian actor nino manfredi who was one of italias best actors ever and who here is condemned to embody a crazy bird wrangler with no back story whose only purpose is to seem to be the wise man of the film and boy does that film need wiseness every other character of the story seems to enjoy swimming in excrement yelling torturing others in excrement fornicating in excrement or laying in excrement some more just for the fun of it it seems to be such fun that each character of the story gets to have his or her turn being dumped in feces at a point or another coming from a dutch director you might think that extreme dirtiness and shockingly real filth are necessary elements in a period piece elements which contributed to make dutch filmmaker paul verhoevens film flesh  blood such a great film the thought of flesh  blood would let anyone hope that a film similarly filthy and visually straightforward would be good unfortunately and unlike flesh  blood there is no dramatic progression no fights no good acting and put simply no flesh and blood the photography as the opening sequence unfolds is welldone and enticing this too stops very early in the film the music from nicola piovani of la vità e bella fame is repetitive and annoying when not irrelevant it sometimes implies that there is grandeur in a sequence while on screen the actors are splashing in liquid dung throughout the first act of the film which lasts nothing less than an hour  the film takes place within the same perimeter which is around the farm where the main characters live the characters play with excrement a lot drown in it play in it a long period of time elapses through numerous ellipses to allows the main character a young boy who loves to play in excrement to become older and play in excrement some more the birdman talks a lot to say foolish things in italian spanish conquistadors speak french nothing makes sense everything is confused and takes hours to happen then there is a second act called the ship in which we see what might have been a ship a long time ago but which is now remains of a ship covered with excrement did i mention the main character while walking a bit further away from the farm just happens to run into it and decides its really cool so lets live in it the hunchback who lived in it before is trying to kill him but he doesnt really mind because did i mention hes not very bright he thinks the ship can navigate and hopes to sail on it until more conquistadors show up at least they seemed to be conquistadors because of the don quixote style hats but as ive said its really confused whos who make the dutchman a prisoner along with the retarded hunchback and they burn the ship to the ground the last part of the film which is really hard to bear for the spectator because it just consists of even more excrement with even more retarded middleage peasants fighting in it takes place in a mad asylum yet more torture and drowning each other with feces yet more loitering for the director who seems to have definitely given up on his job or passed onto the second crew camera assistant to do the rest of the job in the end a lot of the mentallychallenged new friends that the dutchman made die the woman he had sex with who was his brothers wife to begin with tries to have him meet his son the dutchman and his son talk the film ends after two hours of dungy images and calamitous acting and technical performances then the credits roll and the spectator fells immensely free from having to watch atrocious films with no plot that pretend to be something exciting like fantasy films based on legends while they are nothing but a mere catalog of how full of excrement some films can get when they dont have enough financing powers to put battles instead or even horses,negative,0
firstly i loved the book more so than the more popular da vinci code and although the dvc film was not well received i liked it and bought the dvd however there is no chance that i will ever want to watch angles and demons ever again  the film barely resembles the book in fact only the general premise of the story is there  from the very start of the film i was disappointed in the book robert langdon receives a call and fax from maximilian kohler director of cern who finds the body of father cant remember the name and then requests langdon to come using the super fast plane in the book the only people who knew about this technology that the father and daughter team had created were themselves and the camerlingo in the film however there was a massive team involved so the tension was never there how did they find out etc  leaving out or rather changing this whole part of the story was a massive mistake and was in my mind what made it a poor movie it changed everything that happened from then on when the camerlingo was confronted in the popes locked room it should have been maximilian kohler who shot the video from his wheel chair the commander rushed in to get the camerlingo but was shot by olivetti in the film it was the commander in the room and olivetti was shot err i think i got this right but i was bored and cant really remember the events in the film  there was no love interest between vittoria and robert and in the book she wasnt at cern when he arrived and was indeed was flown in from her research work in the book all four of the preferratti were killed but in the film the last one of the four survived the fountain in the book vittoria was kidnapped and robert had to rescue her and it was they that killed the assassin at the church of the illuminati not blown up like he was in the film by the camerlingo the bit where robert was confined under a stone coffin was not there saved by his mickey mouse watch alarm ok in the book we are led to believe that langdon bailed out of the helicopter fair enough to say that this was a bit far stretched but it was important in the film because he had to race back with the film there was no mention of how vittoria and her adopted father became involved this was also important in getting to know the character of vittoria  in all one of the worse films i have seen i would have left early but my brain went numb and i lost the use of my legs temporarily a really really reeeeeeaaaaaaalllly poor attempt and not one of ron howards finest in fact how he will get work again is beyond me i want my money back,negative,0
spinal tap was funny because if you knew a little about heavy metal you saw injokes all over the place if you know anything about porn this mock documentary will leave you cold everything in it rings false  spinal tap was funny because it took a familiar world and pushed it over the top this film is decidedly not funny because it paints a picture of how porn is made that bears no relationship to the real world  the acting here is uniformly awful but that would not matter much if the core idea of the movie were good but its not,negative,0

of all the kungfu films made through the 70s and 80s this is one that has developed a real cult following with the exception of all the films bruce lee starred in this is a film that has stood the test of time and its due to the unique story an aging kungfu master tells his last pupil yang tieh sheng chiang about five pupils he has trained in the past all five wore masks and nobody has seen the face of each other and they have all been trained differently their specialty in kungfu is the name they have adopted like lizard snake centipede toad and scorpion the master called them the poison clan and he does not know what has happened to them so he wants tieh to find them and help the ones that are doing good to stop the others that are evil an old man who was once a member of the poison clan has a map to where he has hidden a lot of money and he seems to be a target tieh does not know what they look like so he has to mingle in society and try and figure out who they are tieh has discovered that the snake is hung wen tung pai wei and along with tang sen kue feng lu who is the centipede they kill a family to find the map a map is found by a mystery man who turns out to be the scorpion but know one knows who he is a local policeman named ho yung sin philip kwok investigates the murders along with his partner ma chow chien sun sin has a friend called li ho meng lo who is the toad and they do know of each others identity the snake bribes the local officials to pin the murders on li ho and while he is in prison he is tortured and killed when sin finds out he teams up with tieh and together they go to combat tung and kue   this film was directed by cheh chang and he was a very special director when it came to these films chang was not your run of the mill kungfu director and his films always had a special quality to them while most martial arts films deal with revenge chang did not use that as a central theme even though there is some revenge going on later in this story this film is more complex than that five men trained by the same master in different ways and wearing masks then they are all in the same area and not knowing who the other is very unique story makes this film different from all the others and most of changs stories were in a class all by themselves i wouldnt exactly put it in the same league as enter the dragon because bruce lee was a worldwide icon and the martial arts he exhibited were more authentic looking this film still has some impossible feats like clinging to sides of walls and all the flipping through the air but this film isnt necessarily about fight scenes its more about the intrigue of the story and the characters that are involved that alone makes this different from all the other kungfu films very well made with a unique story,positive,1
i dont doubt that victor mclaglen won his best actor oscar for this film by dint of a three way split among the mutiny on the bounty leads of clark gable charles laughton and franchot tone who were all in the same race but the informer is still a fine film because john ford wouldnt have gotten his first best director oscar if it wasnt no split involved in his award  the movie and the story by liam oflaherty that it is based on involves a poor simpleton of a man named gypo nolan who was once a member of the irish republican army he was cashiered out of it for some imbecilic stunt he pulled and wants back in hes down to his last pence and if he cant get back in wants enough for passage to america theres a twenty pound reward for information leading to the arrest of a former comrade named frankie mcphillip played by wallace ford in a moment of weakness he goes to the black and tan constabulary and informs on mcphillip  the ira is pretty anxious to find out who ratted mcphillip out and theyre pretty certain it was mclaglen he hasnt the wit to really cover his own tracks he does make a feeble effort to implicate another man named peter mulligan played by donald meek he also picks up a hangeron played by jm kerrigan  the whole action of the informer takes place in 1922 in dublin from about six in the evening to early the following morning of a necessity it is shot in darkness and shadows making it possibly the first noir thriller had it been done post world war ii the informer would have ranked as a great noir classic like odd man out or the the third man which it bares a lot of resemblance to  john ford knew this world very well he took some time off during the rebellion and was in ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the ira his real name before having it anglicized was sean ofiernan  preston foster plays the ira commandant dan gallagher in the book gallagher is a harder and meaner man than foster has him here my guess is that john ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans some rooting interest he makes it clear that foster has to eliminate the informer because the black and tans will grab him and get quite a bit more out of him and put the whole organization in peril  the ira trial scene is the highlight of the film when foster asks donald meek whether he recognizes the authority of their court meek aint in a position to say no the kings justice and writ does not run here it graphically illustrates at that point despite occupation by army troops and constabulary the british are indeed losing their grip on the population  of course the informer a rather grim story has its john ford touches but rather fewer than you would expect even as mclaglen is spending his money on a drunken spree the ira is constantly in the shadows watching him and counting every farthing  the informer is a tale well told about ireland in a grim and dismal time,positive,1

i actually didnt start watching the show until it came on fx i was bored and had nothing to watch and saw that the shows reruns were premiering so i decided to watch it i was so upset that i had not watched the show when it first aired on tv i loved the show so muchfinally a show for everyone to enjoy i remember full house and family matters and step by step and they were okay shows but just not funny enough they would make dumb jokes and laugh over things that were just plain stupid but not that 70s show that 70s show was hilarious smart and so real i think it was the best show ever made and im very sorry that it ended although i love this show i do think it should have ended on the seventh season when eric and kelso leave the last season was just not right eric was the main character and the show should have ended when his character leaves i still love this show and i hope tv starts making more shows like this one,positive,1
this film coincides with mike allreds comic book miniseries red rocket seven and tells the story of an alien who escaped to earth to wait for astroesque which ties into the book of revelations and the apocylpse this is only part of a bigger story if the movie confuses you read rr7 too you can easily tell that allred is used to telling stories with pictures the direction is very good and the effects arent bad for a 500 budget unfortunately mike used many friends to play the roles and probably didnt have the heart to say that they couldnt act also mike is not showing his writing skills in this movie his dialouge spoonfeeds the plot to you and doesnt let you enjoy the characters this was actually disappointing considering his tremendous writing ability shown in his comic books 4 out of 10,negative,0
again were getting a melange of themes well covered by so many previous films the good and the bad son story courtesy east of eden the american marine hero story who doesnt consider himself to be one due to what he knows and the grieving wife potentially falling in love with another man story  the mere fact of those stories being that ubiquitous isnt so much of a problem though because theoretically they could still be better presented and dealt with each time around no luck this time though as all three of those threads ultimately fall flat all the same  as the bad son never really gets to talk to his father so that conflict is never resolved properly apart from the father kind of starting to appreciate the bad son thanks to the latter renovating the kitchen of the grieving wife now how satisfying is that  next the surprisingly homecoming marine suspecting his wife of unfaithfulness conflict never gets resolved because he never really talks to the man under suspicion namely his own brother so once more were handed a loose end here  and finally the american military heroism hypocrisy theme where the marine is publicly considered a hero when due to the dirtiness of war he went through he shouldnt really be called one as to his own standards that third theme falls flat just the same because the movie ends right when for the first time hes just able to talk to his wife about what he went through where the real story would actually begin at that very point namely his process of recovery how that would look like and how he would finally face the family hed have some major guilt to admit to all that all the really interesting bits are passed over and getting ignored  so while story wise this film is a serious and i mean serious disappointment id still give it points for the impressive cast although no film should use maguire for a voice over because that belongs to spiderman especially a grown up gyllenhaal seems to fulfill all the expectations he aroused as a young and aspiring actor so much that id in fact love to see him entrusted with a really deep and demanding lead role of proper profile  so while the cast really seems to do what they can i consider this film totally forgettable otherwise a shallow and ultimately pretentious utterly unsatisfying tear squeezer indeed message du jour to the writers we know the wounds already see the host of vietnam films you want to earn some credit show us a believable healing,negative,0
it is quite rare that a movie comes along that is so useless that i with imdb allowed the use of negative scores in fact i reflect back upon this movie and i truly cannot think of a movie that had so little going for it acting your kidding right direction no a plot no this movie has nothing going for it if you take it as a serious movie this is often the case with movies of this genre but most movies of this nature can be watch as if they are a comedy and you can laugh at how pathetic the characters and situations are and almost get your times worth this movie is so empty that it cannot even suit that purpose i have to give this a 110 three points lower then any other movie i have ever rated i truly feel that the staff involved in this movie should pay me for the 83 minutes i spent watching it i do not really have the words to describe how bad this is no one should ever watch this for any reason again,negative,0
all the bare chested women in the world couldnt keep me from hitting the stop button about a third of the way through this awful rubbish with the derisory acting equally terrible script plus the poor cgi fx to match this movie is an insult to the werewolf genre it is supposed to be serious which in itself would be funny if this film could even make it to the level of being a bad joke  this is one of those movies where the people behind the camera are obviously competent but are too lazy to make something even one quarter decent avoid at all costs and watch one of the classic werewolf movies instead  0 out of 10,negative,0

here is proof of why mary pickford was americas sweetheart in this rather complex drama mary plays the young daughter of a squatter that dare to dream of a relationship with the son of one of the hilltoppers the scenes where they steal a kiss and otherwise fall in love are simply delightful she is even willing to take a bath that mary could pull this role off at the age of 30 is simply amazing and somewhat due to her diminutive stature 5  tess must face numerous physical and emotional challenges she does so with spunk not seen in many heroines of the time tess packs a wallop and is not shy about fighting with anyone why she agrees to help the hilltopper daughter is beyond me but she sacrifices her own happiness in order to keep a deep secret pickfords close ups are wonderful  danishborn jean hersholt is simply wonderful as the villain the scene in which he manhandles a small baby is enough to make you throw vegetables or whatever at the movie screen if forrest robinson who plays daddy skinner had worn a beard he would have been a match for the model used in those world war i recruiting posters of uncle sam  wants you  although the story is somewhat predictable and slow in the beginning it is worth the investment in your time to see the piece or pure americana the film highlights choices available to us all involving making someone else happy and what it is to be a real christian recommended,positive,1
i think its the sort of film you either love or hate and im really not the type to go in for arty movies my mother rented mullhuland dr the other night and i nearly ran from the room ha but i love this film  we recorded the beat one night when we had just let the tape run and got a great film that way by accident saved that tape and watched it a lot i eventually got the vhs to add to my collection ive watched it many times and at one point copied down the poems i even tried to preform one scene for my high school drama class she had said we could do any scene we wanted and just cut out the bad words she refused to let me do it if it could upset my drama teacher that much it has to be good  honest she never treated me the same after that  i liked the acting it came off very true and honest it wasnt clean and polished but it was better than that it was true to life how anyone would truly behave and display emotions not how hollywood does it was great acting especially by the one playing rex  the story was original not only do the characters get drawn into his world but you do too not your typical person meets inner city kids and saves them through knowledge film at all simply caring and friendship make things a bit better  the only thing is that even in the 80s there was more gun violence and less simple stuff like rock throwing but that little bit of innocence didnt hurt this film  i think its a must see you will either love or hate it but either way it makes an impact and that makes a good film that you will remember and talk about later,positive,1

cry freedom is an excellent primer for those wanting an overview of apartheids cruelty in just a couple of hours famed director richard attenborough gandhi is certainly no stranger to the genre and the collaboration of the reallife mr and mrs woods the main white characters in their book and in this film lends further authenticity to cry freedom the video now in release actually runs a little over 2 and a half hours since 23 minutes of extra footage was inserted to make it a two part tv miniseries after the films initial theatrical release while the added length serves to heighten the films forgivable flaws uneven character development and blanket stereotyping in particular another possible flaw the insistence on the white characters fate over that of the african ones may work out as a strength viewing crying freedom as a politically and historically educational film as i think it should over its artistic merits the story is one which black africans know only too well though the younger generation may now need to see it on film for full impact it is the whites who have always been the films and the books target audience hopefully driving them to change now twelve years after the movies production cry freedom is in many ways a more interesting film to watch almost ten years after black majority rule has been at least theorically in place 1987s cry freedoms ideals remain by and large unrealized it therefore remains as imperative as ever for white south africans particularly the younger ones who have only heard of these actions to see it and absorb the films messages in total contrast to american slavery and the jewish holocausts exposure south africans struggles have been told by a mere two or three stories cry freedom cry the beloved country ok count it twice if you include the remake and sarafina did i miss one all three dramas also clumsily feature american and british actors in both the white and black roles not one south african actor has played a major role white coloured indian or black and yes i did miss another international south african drama mandela and deklerk though this also highly recommended biopic was released after black majority rule was instituted mandela was played by a black american sidney poitier who also starred in the original sathemed cry the beloved country while the afrikaner deklerk was played by a bald very british michael caine a good performance if you can dismiss that the very essence of afrikanerdom is vehement antibritish feelings until local sabc tv and african films start dealing with their own legacy cry freedom is about as authentic as youll get as villified as the whites particularly the afrikaners are portrayed in the film any observant noncasual visitor to south africa even now in 1999 not to mention 1977 when cry freedom takes place will generally find whites attitudes towards blacks restrained even understated looking at cry freedom in hindsight it is amazing that reconciliation can take place at all and it is but cry freedom at time shows not much has really changed in many peoples minds yet and that the black africans goal to freedom and reconciliation is still ongoing this is why if youre a novice to the situation cry freedom is your best introduction,positive,1

i have this movie on a collection of inexpensive bmovies its not restored in fact the audio was difficult to discern for the first few minutes  at first it seemed like a typical haunted house film and feels very much like the forerunner of clue murder by death house on haunted hill etc  about a half hour into the film the storyline takes a really interesting twistand it goes from being a cliché melodrama to something entirely different and far more entertaining than i had initially thought  check it out its a great deal of fun even if the long clips and wider shots and near lack of music score make it feel a bit creaky by todays standards,positive,1
heavens gate is not a masterpiece which apparently was what it needed to be upon first release to justify its great cost and more importantly the continued uneasy reliance of hollywood on the auteur model of filmmaking yet heavens gate seen today at last on dvd in a cut of 229 minutes is a superb film it is a touch lethargic in pace but at least it is paced quite apart from the incompetence of construction that marks many films today there have been many films which deliberate in form have been severely damaged by being hacked down with no care for rhythm so the films become shapeless and confusing beyond this the criticisms leveled at the film have become in retrospect quite lame if the good guys and bad guys are too obviously pronounced for a serious film and yes sam waterstons mustachioed furclad villain is comicopera and not in the multileveled manner of bill the butcher from gangs of new york and yes the townsfolk do seem a touch fiddler on the roof on occasions then a few dozen serious films made since then including titanic and the graceless cold mountain which bears certain similarities and is a notable failure in convincing qualities compared to this film can be castigated for exactly the same reason   also despite accusations the film has a plot quite a wellessayed plot at that it simply does not bow to standardform epic quality by providing titan heroes rafts of subplots and confusion it experiments with telling in a manner more like much smaller modest films by carefullycaught moments of character interaction and welltextured pageantlike explosions of communal action as with the opening at harvard and most specially the wonderful scene where the johnson county folk following the lead of a brilliantly physical fiddler make celebration on rollerskates  the deer hunter was a critical and commercial success but abandoned the first halfs inspired mosaiclike accumulation of detail and i think in a manner similar to criticism of robert penn warrens novel all the kings men and its dictionary of jacobean stunts if cimino had not had such a strong grasp of the conventions of hollywood epics he might have made a special rare work of art based in honest visualisation of people within their milieu in contrast heavens gate succeeds in screwing its narrative momentum and tension upwards in a slowly expanding arc until the finale explodes whilst not abandoning the mosaic approach  the central romantic triangle for instance resists standard inflections a decent intelligent but psychically defeated man james averill kris kristofferson competes with a hotshot but identitychallenged young gunman nate champion christopher walken for the hand of a young madame ella watson isabelle huppert there is no selfconscious bedhopping no slaps in the face recriminations or typical sadsack moments but more a sad and distanced decision by ella to choose the younger man whom she loves less because he is ready to make the commitment ella emerges as the films true hero hupperts performance though initially awkward is really quite excellent balancing a dewy emotionalism with a hardhammered spirit attempting first to rescue nate and then mustering the resistance party of immigrants into an enterprising defence subsequently averill is stung into action as friends die indeed in the process of overcoming so many traps of cliché and style heavens gate successfully and willfully throws off the defeated outsiderheroes grace note of so many 70s westerns and portrays an eventual vigorous cheertheheroes rallying to a compromised but still relished victory   the social conflict of so many 70s westerns at last hardens into a fullyfledged war where capital attempts a crushing final victory over the miscreants who stand in their way suddenly they find a massed and morepowerful peoples army led by the man who played the thoroughlydestroyed billy the kid a decade before this is what led the film to be described as the first marxist western but really it simply deflowers a theme of the genre extant well before the 60s such various and classic oldschool works as william wylers the westerner and even shane tell awfully similar stories it is simply here that the romantic myth of the gunslinger has been replaced by the romantic myth of the peoples revolt in a spectacular exiting but realistic and thus chaotic finale the marauding cattlemens encampment is attacked ringed by dust clouds punctuated by fallen horses writhing bodies and gunfire averill puts his classical education to work finally by stealing a roman trick and bringing the cattlemen to the brink of annihilation before they are rescued by the cavalry another distinctly seditious touch but surely not so offensive after little big mans unrelenting depiction of native american massacres really its hard to think of a more heroically american vision of grassroots resistance the films only real dead spot stands as an unnecessary coda indicating averills eventual relapse a rather potted piece of tragedy   despite then certain failings and a slow midsection heavens gate is a supreme piece of work a genuine attempt to create a contemporary western and a new kind of epic if one has to still join the chorus that reckons cimino was absurd in his behaviour on set and expenditure it is regretfully when today flops like the adventures of pluto nash and k19  the widowmaker see nearly a hundred million dollars sink down the drain and yet a tag of infamy still hangs on this film one ponders what exactly its grim death signified the attempt at original style the bawdy sexuality the very hardwon sense of detail the breathtaking rigor of the filmmaking and what is being filmed all throw into contrast what is sorely lacking in so much contemporary hollywood product,positive,1
having read the books and seen the 1982 anthony andrewsjane  seymour version i have to say that this is not good at all  according to the books percy is supposed to be a seemingly  foppish aristocrat when hes being percy and witty and clever  when hes being the pimpernel but here he just looks bored as  percy and mean as the pimpernel marguerite is supposed to be  the most beautiful woman in europe not a tired and frumpylooking matron she looks middleaged probably due to  bad makeup richard e grant has done much better things and  elizabeth mcgoverns acting is uninspired and flat the wit and  dash of the books and the andrewsseymour film is here replaced  by brawn and flashy editing that just dont make the cut    i might add that to a person who hasnt seen any previous version  or read the book it would probably look ok,negative,0
fool for love is one of the several now forgotten films robert altman directed throughout the 1980s this one a screen adaptation of a sam shepard play that features shepard in the lead role just simply isnt very good altman made many notverygood films over the course of his fascinating career and many times the fault was his but here i think the fault lies with shepard for writing such a flimsy play altmans direction is assured the performances are ok given what the actors have to work with but this inconsequential screenplay goes nowhere and takes its time getting there  shepard is eddie a stuntman who has a lovehate relationship with may kim basinger the two fight endlessly over the course of an evening spent in some dusty motel in the middle of nowhere while a mysterious man harry dean stanton who may be either a figurative or literal father to both eddie and may quietly observes randy quaid rounds out the fourperson cast as a gentleman caller  the only dramatic hook in the entire plot is the suggestion that eddies and mays relationship is incestuous however this hook feels more like a gimmick than anything the screenplay doesnt explore their relationship in any detail and it doesnt use their relationship to explore any more universal themes shepard and basigner create eccentric mannered characters who grow irritating within the first five minutes stanton and quaid have little to do but provide reaction shots   the last half hour or so of the film is especially bad when eddies and mays back stories begin to play out in flashback over monotone somnolent voice over  chalk this up to another of altmans experiments gone awry  grade c,negative,0
a very sensitive topic15 yo girl abandoned by mother as a baby and who goes to visit her continues to be ignored is raped by her moms boyfriend becomes pregnant there was not enough depth displayed of this situation too much of time is taken up on the chase with the truckers transporting the baby interesting this baby with asthmayou never see him cry except once be fed have is diaper changed during the whole truck transport ordeal i would have liked to have seen more of the interrelationships more focus on the fact that this girl was a minorthis should have stood up in court immediately  and this was a true story it deserved a better telling than that  if it werent for the subject matter i would have given this closer to a 0 rating i rented this from the library only later i found out it was a made for tv movie   oh well,negative,0
despite what a lot of other people thought about the first movie i really liked it this one however how to sum it up in one word this movie is and here comes the word crap  but lets look at it part by part here is the plot finally the old queen has been removed from her castle but her successor snow white has problems of another sort the courtjester father of her son has gone astray as the super spliss goes to the extreme to battle his gray hair and sells the royal offspring for some blond and full hair in her desperation snow white seeks the help of bubi otto walkeeswho must first find his other six dwarf companions and then try to find the royal offspring or at least try to find the name of rumpelstiltskin  the whole plot seems to have been written on a weekend where the writers were very drunk but were just under pressure from the studio to write the screenplay   yes there are some good jokes even for fans of the first part or for fans of any of the other actors its really not worth buying the the dvd believe me   the only thing that at least kind of saves the movie from complete oblivion are the performances of some of the actors thats why i gave the move 310 sadly the script is so bad that none of the actors or all of them combined can make up for the bad story  for example at one point they even cross over in our reality and sadly they dont do anything funny while being here   still a lot of great actors in this movie otto waalkes ralf schmitz martin schneider nina hagen cosma shiva hagen especially funny rüdiger hoffmann as the mirror helge schneider and many more but sadly all these comedians arent able to bring this really bad script to life   maybe it is a treat for some hardcore fans but for regular movie goers or by now dvd renters or buyers its not worth the money   i even regret renting the movie,negative,0
this movie is sort of similar to better off dead as it has some of the same stars this one though isnt quite as good granted it is rather funny and enjoyable there is something about betterthat i like well better this one has these guys going to nantucket to spend there summer vacation while there they meet this girl whos trying to save here house from this guy who wants to turn it into a lobster restaurant this guy really doesnt seem to like lobsters cause in one scene he sticks it into boiling water and puts in a stethoscope so he can hear it scream the main character is torn between this girl and the girl of the son of the guy who wants to make the restaurant somehow or another this leads to a big boat race showdown kind of like in summer rental though it works a bit better here and fits into the plot a little better though what is the deal with boat races at this time was there some weird fascination with them for the most part this movie delivers laughs at a good clip but better off dead was still better cause it was the first and the jokes worked better,positive,1
i walked into the movie theater with no expectations for the film i was about to witness everything is illuminated i walked out with a joy i have barely come to feel with american films the directorial debut of actor leiv schreiber the film follows a man on his journey through the past accompanied by an eccentric group including a brakedancing barely englishspeaking punk from the eukraine his grandfather who believes he is blind and their crazy dog the first half of the film is funny and smart with an extremely european flavor in the usage of small but wonderful characters while the second half of the film descends into a somber story of discovery and the holocaust this little movie brings out so many emotions and so many colors with such a wonderful conclusion and is more than just a story of illumination but also of relationships and connections the acting is incredibly powerful the story mysterious and interesting and the artistic appeal of the cinematography to die for with some brilliant and absolutely touching scenes everything is illuminated managed to capture my heart,positive,1
buster keaton was arguably at his most enjoyable when he did short 20 minute films and they dont come more ribticklingly funny than this gem the dead pan comic gets involved in a photographic mixup with a wanted felon this leads to his elaborate evasion of several street cops and fellow passengers who recognise the his face from the wanted signs the goat is chocabloc with brilliant site gags from the opening scene at the bread queue right up to the wonderful elevator chase at the end a keaton film never feels as though its silence is lacking as sound is never something you needed with him his movies explain themselves through the wonderful yet incredibly dangerous things he did to himself it isnt hard to see just how influential he really was  the man is every bit as thoroughly amazing today as he was in 1921,positive,1

this was on at 2 or so in the morning one saturday a few years ago for various reasons i dont remember the entire story but what remains are the two standout performances from the central characters dom has had a unfortunate lot manipulated  literally working a rubbish job eugene torn between personal aspirations and duty towards his sibling tom hulce dom doesnt plead for sympathy  it comes naturally ray liotta is a universe away from henry hill displaying a soft centre in what must feel a thankless position  in many ways this deals with the dilemma many young carers face  the past or the future as it turns out with some work the two can happily coexist thoughtfully handled  sensitively played dominick  eugene is difficult not to warm to,positive,1
i loved this movie im shocked and disappointed that it never made it to the theaters every story was better than the lastmuch better than the much hyped scream series and i know what you did last summerand way better than the terrible urban legend id recommend this film to every horror fan,positive,1
this movie was horrible and the only reason it was even made was because the story appealed to the farleft i consider my self a moderate so i was able to see this film as the pile of garbage it was while im not a bush fan your dislike for gw is not enough of a reason to see this movie  to start the movie was shot on such lowgrade film that it comes off as cheap rather then artsy additionally the characters are seriously lacking in depth chris coopers character was a poor parody of george bush better suited for saturday night live then a dramatic film the rest of the characters are walking clichés and are poor facsimiles of other characters from much better movies  avoid this movie at all costs,negative,0
slow incomprehensible boring three enthusiastic words that describe the movie of the book this is surely a case where the movie should never have been made at the expense of the book the best part of the movie was the scenery excellent the worst part was the slow moving interactions of the actors which combined with endless meaningful glances the editing is abrupt and patchy however despite this the actors worked very hard at least trying to be a little believable with a terrible script it was startling that although set in peru there was hardly a person of peruvian descent wandering about the set  even in the flashback scenes depicting peru in the 17th century if you have any sense of history try to avoid this movie,negative,0
kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a film mainly through cinematography but also using an ingenious score he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start it really is this flawless ambiance that makes the shining the masterpiece that it is in my eyes of course it doesnt hurt that jack nicholson gives one of the greatest performances ive ever seen a frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad duvall and lloyd are artificial to be nice but its easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so brilliant plus it features the actor with the greatest name of all time scatman crothers,positive,1
ok i wanted to see this because it had a few good reviews but this movie was awful just plain awful the characters were 1 dimensional and nothing the actors could do could ever breathe any life into them the story was abysmal the wind stopped becoming a plot device halfway through it just completely becomes forgotten the visuals while were cool were sooooo drawn out 5 minutes of a guy crawling on the ground 3 minutes of a girl putting on her makeup i dont know what this guy is trying to pull off its like he had no plot no dialog and the movie needed to run just so long so lets not edit scenes at all foreign films are great for creating a story without using a lot of dialog this movie makes me think that there is no way american cinema can ever do this i want to give up watching movies altogether bad bad movie,negative,0
i suppose the ultimate curse of attending the toronto film festival is your release date time table get messed up quite frankly im just happy fido got picked up for us distribution in any case  ever seen shaun of the dead good how about lassie able to reconcile the two well if you can your name might be andrew currie canadian helmer of the first ever family themed zombie comedy or zomedy seriously thats what the press book in toronto called it though not as violent dry or british as shaun of the dead fido remains true to its roots a devotion to old 50s black and white television including both lassie and the infamous scifi pulp that was being pumped out during the period  fidos talented headliners carrie anne moss billy connelly dylan baker and tim blake nelson stand as a testament to the brilliance of the script the film explores all the implications of its premise a world where zombies have been converted to servants because of the sheer number of them due to a strange accident what would you use your new undead servant for a butler manual labor a pet unspeakable acts fido tackles all these possibilities in a sweet and surprisingly classy way with much thanks to the work of connelly as one of said zombies and young tv actor ksun ray who seems at times to be a better young elijah wood than the young elijah wood was  if youre expecting another shaun of the dead dont waste your time theres not nearly enough gore and pokes at the genre to satisfy you and youll just leave the theater bitter and depressed but if youre willing to take a look at what happens to shaun of the dead when it jumps across the lake youre in for a treat think of fido as the sensitive more often beaten up little brother to shaun of the deads rebellious loser and youre starting to get the drift if you like or at least tolerate zombies small children and loads of deadpan satire fidos the film for you if thats not the casewell you know the drill just hit em square between the eyes,positive,1
new rule nobody is allowed to make any more zombie movies unless they actually come up with an original idea  sadly this movie doesnt they have the premise that bounty hunters go out and kill zombies and prove it by cutting off their fingers well problems with that most people have ten fingers why not just collect ten bounties for one zombie why not just kill a regular person and pass that off as a zombie finger   not to mention the utter silliness of hunting zombies with a bolt action rifle  i sometimes think films like this are resume fillers for makeup and fx guys hey this is what i did with ten dollars and some recylced bottles deposit imagine what i could do if you gave me a budget do you think anyone goes to drama school or cinema school to star in a zombie movie i went to the school of the arts check me out as the tunnel zombie in quick and the undead his mother must be so proud  these had to be the wimpiest zombies ever as a whole crowed of them apparently couldnt push down a wooden door or even break a glass window no they had to wait for the bounty hunter to open the door for them,negative,0

i think that complete savages is a very good tv show and they should make many more episodes it is one of my favourites it is very funny and it is really good acting i say that you should give them a chance to do more episodes iknow that they can and they should they should put complete savages on nickelodeon more than what they do im sure that many people will agree with me i like the tv show because it is a very good programme for people our age and it is very funny i also like complete savages because it isnt always about the same thing and things that happen could be real unlike other yv programmes when they advertised it i didnt like the sound of it but i watched it for the first time and i loved it complete savages is an excellent comedy and i miss it being on tv i cant really compare complete savages with any other tv series because it is different,positive,1
the sequel that no one asked for to the movie no one wanted there are obviously too many flaws with this movie to name here so ill just concentrate on the acting miles okeefe would have been better suited to play the spritely asian sidekick thong mainly because he would then have no dialogue lisa foster delivers her lines displaying one emotion dullness charles borremel brings life to his part by pausing every five words and finally the flamboyant john saxontype guyno comment is needed  see conan the barbarian if you need to but dont waste your time with this lowbudget loser,negative,0
the person who wrote the glowing review of this misguided project must be related to the writerdirectorstaror is in fact the same person as it defies rational thinking that this movie would be appealing to anyone not connected to a very tightly woven inner circle how about this you want to make a movietell a story entertain draw me in with vivid characters sure you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal however do not address elements of artistic expression in a vacuum in which the audience is in a continual struggle to grasp at skimpy narrative threads if im to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread then make the concrete fabric easier to buy,negative,0
i looked forward to watching this film since i loved the david lynch version in my first attempt at watching it i fell asleep nothing was happening the next night i tried to watch the rest and again it was putting me to sleep nothing ever happened in this movie that could keep anyones interest alive the only time it got a bit more exciting was when i tried it on fast forward the dvd came with a second disk which contained bonus material needless to say i had no hard to go through the torture of watching more of dune 2000 here are the low points the acting was bad the plot moved in slow motion the sets were and looked cheap the direction was pathetic and the cgi visual effects childish  if you want to watch dune save your money or rent the 1984 version,negative,0

i actually saw this movie in the theater back in its original release it was painful to watch peter sellers embarrass himself so badly the story was incredibly lame and difficult to follow and the ending was ridiculous it was just sad to see how the mighty had fallen i wont say that im a huge peter sellers fan but i did thoroughly enjoy the pink panther series and i felt that he gave a strong performance in being there but this film should never have been made from what ive read he pursued producing this film against the advice of the people around him fine but that still doesnt excuse the studio actually releasing the film,negative,0

this early version of the tale the student of prague was made in germany in 1913 starring paul wegener who was also in the golem a few years later in this film he plays a dual role technically impressive for a 95 year old film to see them in the same shot after meeting a mysterious old man who makes a pact with him for gold  the gold he needs to woo a countess hes previously saved from drowning  moving at a fast pace the film runs just over an hour and fairly well written and characterised the student of prague has echoes of the faust legend as well as dr jekyll and mr hyde starting as it does with a pact with a mysterious figure of potential evil and developing into good and evil sides of the same person,positive,1
but if you like the muppets i defy you to dislike this one basically the same plot regurgitated this time new york not la it features a lot of fun cameos and muppet hijinx a lot of the muppets leave the film pretty early on as it centers around kermy and miss piggy i happened to have enjoyed it greatly fun to watch with your kids,positive,1
heres another of the 1940s westerns that i watch whenever it comes on tcm or fmc because although it may be flawed historically it is extremely entertaining and well acted plus its got randolph scott my favorite actor second only to gary cooperwell ok fourth behind coop charlton heston and gregory peck but the film itself to me anyway is reasonably historically accurate and as i said before well acted and flows very welli bet ive seen it 50 or 60 times and enjoy each viewing more than the one before i have it on tape from tcm but would buy it in a minute if it ever came out on dvd see it if you havent i guarantee youll like it,positive,1

my girlfriend and i are really into cheesy horror flicks especially ones with lots of unnecessary nudity when we saw the box cover for this movie at blockbuster we thought it would be a perfect movie for the night we began watching it already not expecting it to be great but thought it would at least catch our interest 20 minutes into the movie we realized that the pace would not eventually pick up and that it was an incredibly boring movie we tried to get into it but the plot made very little sense even after reading the back of the dvd box over and over again the film was shot very dark and it was pretty annoying to try to figure out what was going on in each shot each violent scenes were very hard to make out and you never get to actually watch the violence youre expecting this is definitely a film without motive that was shot poorly and very drawn out each scene was about 20 minute of the same thing and i felt i got the point after the first 5 skip this film and rewatch another freddy or jason flick and youll be way more content,negative,0
just kidding  seeking greener pastures in the form of hustling in new york city jon voight is young optimist cowboy almost forest gumplike joe buck from texas it does not take long for the big apple to mercilessly swallow him and his ambitions whole and very soon joe is the target of both the coldness of new yorkers and cons from its streetthugs given his pure heart he takes pity on one of these thugs ratso rizzo dustin hoffman and later moves in with him in his wreck of apartment and the two literally struggle to survive  while midnight comedy is labeled as a drama it is best described as either a tragic comedy or a comedic tragedy in my opinion it is above all a beautiful film that is stylish in capturing the contemporary hippievibe of the late 1960s with its mandatory dizzying warholparty cinematography and juxtaposing it with ultraurban new york city the film crams cowboy joe buck somewhere in between thereby emphasizing his outofplace position we feel for his struggle to fit in but also to merely get enough money to feed ratso rizzo  midnight cowboy brought tears to my eyes as it is also rich in substance and projects a lot of heart i imagine this film must have inspired both forest gump with its purehearted and outofplace lead character and to an extent the crocodile dundee films as it deals with almost the exact same kind of humour  a contrast between countrycowboys and slick new york cosmopolitans very compelling and sensationally creative film that i highly recommend  8510,positive,1
i found it highly intellectual and artistic in every way i felt that the script was conveying all the things i feel physically and emotionally when i got home from work and watched it this is a tribute to cinema in the highest form and format  holy guacamole how i wish those days would come again i tried putting a bubble window on the side of my car honda civic 1984 but the vacuum formed muffin trays didnt quite cut it also in my civic sexual positions are limited and are not supported by water bed as is brilliantly depicted in the van  the van is of the utmost side splitting hilarity and can even substitute for porn if you watch some scenes privately  i highly anticipate that sam grossman the director has achieved his opus  ratings john 12 sam ,positive,1
one of the best documentaries released in recent years some points  1 hugo chavez was elected venezuelas president in 1998 his support largely coming from the poorer regions of venezuela  2 in 2002 a coup briefly deposed chavez at the time irish filmmakers kim bartley and donnacha obriain were in caracas shooting a documentary about chavez for british television their film deconstructs the coup and its aftermath and electrifyingly records history unfolding onthespot outside and inside the presidential palace  3 chavez aimed to free venezuela from the freemarket policies imposed on it by the us though venezuelas oil was already stateowned it was run for private benefit by executives who chavez wished to replace  4 despite being the worlds fourth largest oil supplier venezuela remains swamped by poverty its resources literally sucked away by foreign multinational corporations  5 the documentary begins by portraying chavezs first years as president before the coup it focuses on his popularity with the poor and his various policies which proved popular with working class locals educational plans distribution of the oil revenue grassroot democracy etc  6 chavez was a huge proponent of education and printed thousands of copies of the venezuelan constitution encouraging children and adults to study and understand it  7 when chavez came to power he immediately pledged to redistribute oil profits this understandably made the oil companies nervous  8 a mediawar broke out the six private tv stations promptly began opposing the staterun tv station they questioned chavezs motives sanity and sexual orientation  9 without media support the coup would not have been successful the film makes it clear that coups rely heavily on the media to disseminate information and that news can be easily fabricated  10 under the guise of reestablishing democracy the opposition silenced the staterun tv station dissolved the national electoral board supreme court national assembly and took control of the military  11 moneyed interests backed by the military elite encouraged by the us and cia organised a citizens march on the presidential palace to effect the coup snipers shot at chávez supporters but the private media stations edited footage so it appeared that return fire was aimed at the opposition march that in fact had been safely diverted  12 police went on a shooting rampage against chavez supporters further bloodying the streets  13 chavez held captive refused to resign of course the mediagovernment then lied saying he had resigned but chavezs cabinet members communicated the truth to the international community which eventually got the message back to venezuela by cable tv  14 the people rose up pressuring the return of the president they had elected whom only a referendum could constitutionally replace  8910  at a little over an hour long this doc is far too short nevertheless its an engrossing piece of journalism and deals with a form of media warfare which rarely gets touched upon makes a great companion piece to the battle of algiers  worth one viewing,positive,1
i saw this film in the movie theater i was taking classes at the second city chicago and of course the buzz of this movie was intense it is a woodward film about one of second citys native sons  everyone knew about johns history everyone knew how he died some even knew that the lore did not make him out to be particularly friendly towards women in improv or comedy  but hey the man led his life and he was loved intensely by the people who were in his world and lore also states that he treated all of his close friends with love and respect  this movie well forget the idea of poor michael chilklis who is a really great actor being in a really astonishingly bad film and really only relegated to doing an impersonation of the man  forget the idea that they could not get the rights to any of belushis workand all the snl scenes never happened that they portrayed in the movie  screw the idea that half of the historical information in the film did not even follow bob woodwards work kinda saying okaywe are about to mess with belushinow lets go after woodward too they also decided to take the premise of its a wonderful life and turn it into its a horrible life on crack  is he a guardian angel or the devil is the pinball machine the devils assistant electronic devicehow many different endings can you tack onto to a movie it is one of those movies after it is overyou look at the person you are with and in stunned disbelief go what the hell was that in some circles this movie has become a kinda cult classic but for good reason  a good cult classic you sit around the screen and make fun of or throw out snappy one liners to the screen a cult film is never good and most people would never watch them in any serious context  if you want to watch some classic bad late 80s fair stoned rent wired if you want to know about john belushiyou can get more information off of the walls of second city chicago than this movie,negative,0
or viceversa  this is a french film noir directed by an american film maker jules dassin who had to leave the country because of being blacklisted by hollywood thanks to huac the premise of the story is rather familiarone last jewel heist for tony le stephanois and his budsand so is the ending with everybody getting well no spoilers here for sure since this is the sort of film in which tension toward the ending is important  dassin filmed in realistic lighting in black and white on the streets of paris using actors and actresses who are not glamorous the engagingsometimes intrudingscore by georges auric nicely enhances the movie and will remind viewers of many a similar score from american film noirs from the forties and early fifties jean servais plays the hardcore consumptive lead in a fedora much as humphrey bogart might have played him tonys recently out of prison past his prime but still tough and decisive when he has to be his mind still sharp when focused the kind of antihero whose eyes water even though the tears will never fall  dassin plays the italian safecracker and wouldbe ladies man who knows the rules but gets careless  in film noir we are forced by the logic and focus of the film to identify with the bad guys often there are levels of bad guys the good bad guys we are identifying with and the bad bad guys who are out to do in our good bad guys and then maybe theres a really bad bad bad guy or two here we have remi grutter played by robert hossein a slightly sadistic druggie then there are the cops who are irrelevant or nearly so in more modern film noir the bad guys are not even good bad guys and they get away with it or something close to that in the old film noir which evolved from the gangster films of the thirties the usual motto following the old hollywood code was crime doesnt pay with every criminal having to pay for his or her crime before the end of the movie  probably the most impressive feature of rififi is how nicely the film moves along the plot unfolds quickly and seamlessly much the way the great film directors always did it directors like stanley kubrick louis malle and the best of hitchcock some have actually compared this to kubricks the killing 1956 and suggest that kubrick stole a little well directors always steal if need be and there are some perhaps telling similarities such as it being one last heist for the protagonist and having the girl gum up the works the similarities may go deeper because as this film was nearing its end i suddenly thought oh no the suitcase in the back seat is going to fly out of the convertible hit the ground burst open and all the money is going to fly into the air those of you who have seen the killing may recall what happened to the money near the end of the film which reminds me of another film with something bad happening to the money oliver stones u turn 1997 starring sean penn there the money in his backpack gets blown to smithereens by a shotgun blast ha ha ha getting the dubbed version of this film would be an act of sacrilege since the dialogue when there is some the heist itself is done entirely without dialogue about 30 minutes worth is terse and easy to follow requiring only an occasional glance at the subtitles which by the way are quite utilitarian and guiding as opposed to having every word spelled out  one other thing all the brutality is done as sex used to be done in film that is off camera a guy gets his throat slit we dont see it i kind of like this approach we dont have to see the gore you could almost let your kids see rififialmost  catch this one now and be on the lookout for a hollywood reprise starring al pacino and directed by harold becker coming out next year in which you can be sure that the violent scenes will be played out in full,positive,1
this movie has some of the best dialogue ever written the really good lines are all given to george c scott a man who knew what to do with a juicy piece of dialogue i just saw this movie again for the first time in 20 years and the dialogue is as good as ever the bizarre goingson at the hospital are so imaginative as to dazzle you they frequently involve such marvelous poetic justice as to be near strokes of genius i love this movie,positive,1
the mummys curse is the last in the series of the kharis mummy films and it seems that creativity had run somewhat dry by the time they made this one kharis and his mate ananka both end up in the bayous of louisiana and on his resurrection he searches out his beloved princess how they end up in louisiana isnt made entirely clear but with various people trying to find them the viewer can be assured of some mummy murders  the mummys curse was watchable but it really wasnt anything special i had the feeling throughout the movie that id seen this before quite frankly apart from the original the mummy with boris karloff the mummy movies are not my favorites among the old universal horrors theyre not bad but they do get a bit repetitive  there are some great scenes in the movie the scene with ananka coming to life in the swamp for instance but overall this didnt do much for me  its worth seeing if you want to be completest and see all of the mummy movies but otherwise you might want to pass on this one,negative,0
about the movie itself there are ample comments   i just wanted to say something about the german version which i have seen recently on tv it is heavily cut from 103 to 76 minutes it is usual that the most bloody scenes are cut for german tv i understand the reasons for that but this movie was something else they did not only cut goreshots  they have cut entire sequences sparing only glimpses like we have to attack them  one 5 second shot of explosions in the camp  protagonist running away  when the assault on the island begins it isnt even possible anymore to follow the storyline all the cuts create something that amounts to a string of erratic disconnected scenes that dont make any sense anymore  i could not stand to watch the end after spending 60 minutes on this nonsense  i think i would have given the original 710 the german version is worth only 110  get it on dvd and check the runtime first or forget about it,negative,0
this tvm seems to have polarised opinions amongst the commentators on this page so perhaps i can settle everything by saying this is a very stupid not very well made television movie  how bad is it  its a teleplay that cant even decide what its name is because while everyone in america calls it linda its known in britain as lust for murder and its usually a bad sign when a movie has to change its name  and can i also point out that its not a tongue in cheek spoof as somebody else claimed   i will be honest and say the plot is rather sound  linda and paul cowley meet another couple called the jeffries who they get on very well with  they get on so well that they go on holiday together  make up your own mind if theres some wife swapping going on  and paul sees his wife kill the jeffries  after that the plot takes a shock twist   writing the above paragraph i have suddenly realised the large amount of potential the story had and i wont say anything to put you off the premise  its just that when the story continues after the events ive described things become more and more unlikely and bizarre  not only that but the production values are fairly unimpressive with the actor playing paul cowley doing a very wooden voice over that irritates while most of the scenes  exterior and interior  look like theyve been filmed on a foggy day,negative,0
  back in his youth the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin but his family forbid it many decades later the old man has raised three children two boys and one girl and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children soon the sister is bored with brother 1 and jumps in the bed of brother 2  one might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island but no  they are upper class europeans going to college and busy in the social world  never do we see a flirtatious moment between any nonrelated female and the two brothers never do we see any flirtatious moment between any nonrelated male and the one sister all flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister  the weakest part of gladiator was the incest thing the young emperor commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriageminded girls all over him but no  he only wanted his sister if movie incest is your cup of tea then sunshine will slowly thrill you to no end,negative,0
it is the best movie released in bollywood upto date the best comedy the best acting and the best direction till now rajkumar santoshis writing and direction proved that he is one of the best directors in the industry aamir khan was absolutely amazing salman khan looked good the way he acted shakti kapoor was good but jagdeep over acted as usual this comedy is still copied by people and no other writers and directors have been able to make this thing again even rajkumar santoshi hasnt been able to make this cult classic again this movie was a flop when it released but it has been a cult classic since it released and loved by all kinds of people  star  acting 1010  dialogues 1010  screenplay 1010  direction 1010  music 910  lyrics 910  overall this movie is strongly recommended if you didnt watch it till now you missed something big it is a laugh riot and the best comedy i have seen till date classic films like hera pheri golmaal and jaane bhi do jaaro are not even half as funny as this  great movie hats off,positive,1
this was a highly original decent movie and a brave move for all those involved i dont care if its not the most well puttogether movie of all time the fact that it has eddie murphy doing something nonformulaic and that i dont know what will happen next makes it a favorite of mine i wish more movies were as imaginative as this one rather than the same old formula for entertainment,positive,1
like watching a neighbors summer camp home movies indian summer is a sleep inducing bore eight alumni campers are barely introduced when unbelievably boring flashbacks begin for characters we know nothing about fine actors alan arkin and bill paxton are totally wasted in this film one campers observation that everything seems so much smaller than i remember it is repeated at least ten times enough to make you squirm the anticipated pranks are neither funny or original unless you think that short sheeting is a real howler this movie was a great disappointment considering the ample talent involved indian summer did not make me homesick just sick  merk,negative,0
i have loved one true thing since the first time i watched it in the theater and cried my eyes out i bought it as soon as it was available and have lost track of how many times ive watched it  to me one true thing is the ultimate family relationship movie i love watching the relationships in the family change and evolve into what they end up being i can relate to many details in the movie my mother died of bone cancer so it really hits home with me maybe this is why i love it so much  i like the relationships between the children and their parents and the relationship of brother and sister but especially love the relationship between husband and wife to me it is truly beautiful  i highly recommend this move to anyone who enjoys this kind of movie,positive,1
the cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music filmmakers were daring to make avantgarde films discussing taboo subjects only permitted before in exploitation films starting with both breathless and underground american cinema such as kenneth anger films became more and more experimental all of this accumulated when hollywood realized they had mass commercial appeal with easy rider one of the best and most surprising outputs of this era was also one of the least successful initially head was made when the monkees career was seriously waning which is what damned one of the best psychedelic films ever made  the plot well there really isnt one as many have said it involves the monkees going from one surreal scenario to the next one however these sequences are all obviously lsdtinged and basically mock how the monkees were sick of being confined to their light prefab reputation its a shame that the film found no audience the teeny boppers who loved them had moved onto a new fad as they always do the psychedelic  haightashbury crowd to whom the film was garnered would never be caught dead at a monkees movie its all their loss this film may be plot less but it is certainly not without meaning and is very intelligently put together the crew later made both easy rider and five easy pieces the film was later revived at a 1973 raybert retrospective and it gained a very positive response which granted it the cult following it had deserved for a long time ironically the monkees would fall victim to the same commercialism they protested in this film with their later 80s reunion 1010,positive,1
im not to keen on the pallbearer its not too bad but just very slow at the times as the movie goes on it gets a little more interesting but nothing brilliant i really like david schwimmer and i think hes good here im not a massive gwyneth paltrow fan but i dont mind her sometimes and shes okay here the pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie but if you like the leads then you might enjoy it,negative,0
frankly i met real han su ying before and seeing her portrayed by an american actress which has no resemblance of anything chinese makes my head spin while i am watching this movie why cant hollywood get nancy kwan instead  at least its more true to the storycos for goodness sakedr han su ying is chinese i know cos i have meet her in person  and looking at the whole castso few asian faces in a movie about a asian love story makes me wonder too   i think the acting is good but without real asian faces in a asian love story makes the plot so corny and a whole load of baloney  its just like another movie i know of  the conqueror imagine my eyes pop out when i see john wayne as genghis khan  and to make matter worst how on earth can a man born an bred in mongolian steppes come up with a alabama southern accent  and a cheap imitation of anything asian  good grief  i am not surprise that one day i will see dr martin luther king jr being played by one of the boys from the black and white minstrel show  would love to see that  and laugh the whole roof off   cheers,negative,0
well groomed well behaved teen meg tilly must spend the night in a creepy mausoleum as an initiation into a high school club problem is a powerful psychic named raymar was just buried there that day but he isnt quite dead and he needs the life force of humans for his powers  obscure horror film offers plenty of thrills and chills an appealing and likeable cast and most superior special effects  my rating 7 out of 10  one dark night is rated r for violence and adult themes,positive,1
burlinson and thornton give an outstanding performance in this movie along with dennehy although it is at first thought to be only about love it really goes down deeper than that the beauty of nature captures this movie placing among one of the best i have ever seen the horse scenes are absolutely fantastic any horselovers out there will love this movie  ,positive,1
this may sound crazy to even the people who remember this showbut i remembered this as being liveaction i dont think i ever saw the cartoon but movie maybe i remember it very clearly the guy was in a building kinda like a showroom he even had the red jacket it was dark out and he turned into a red car and there was this guy on the second level looking down at him the carguy spun around and crashed through the big showroom type window and out onto the street and then proceeded to drive off that is all i remember i really hope someone else out there remembers this too if not maybe im still crazy but im hoping im not,negative,0
while possibly the stupidest most tasteless and violent slapstick comedy ever made guest house is also a very funny one dont listen to the critics they have no sense of humour while the climax runs out of steam but not vomit its still a funny party movie seven candles in the eye out of ten,positive,1
this movie had an interesting cast it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job im glad we have b grade movies like this one the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it you dont need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot i like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didnt close down a café to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station arnold vosloo and michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation this was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future,positive,1
what can be said really the tenant is a firstclass thriller wrought with equal amounts of suspense and fullblown paranoia its an intricatelyplotted filmevery detail seems included for a reasoneven though the plot seldom makes sense and much of it is never even addressed in an objective manner therefore we are left with the increasingly unstable trelkovsky polanskia meek polish man who has obtained an apartment due to the previous tenants suicideto guide us through a world of escalating fear and uncertainty after an apartmentwarming party thrown by a group of obnoxious coworkers trelkovsky comes under increased seemingly inexplicable scrutiny by the fellow occupants in his building the rest of the film chronicles his mental deterioration and gives us a thorough mindfuk on par with the later efforts of david lynch the tenant however is more brooding and sinister laced with unexpected comic relief fine performances and a truly haunting score its a movie thats better experienced than described so hop to it,positive,1
this movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in hollywood the fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business the idea that audiences paid to see this movie and like an idiot i rented the film is discouraging also  obsessed teacher 3 years prior kills teenagers family because he wants her for no reason he kills the mother father and brother from the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction years later obsessed teacher breaks out of prison hmmusual bad writingno one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a navy seal and can sneak around sniff out people and with a knife is super killer sure now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason knifes bellhop for the fun of it and starts to hunt down the teenagers friends now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotelagain it is stupid ever cop would know his facebut he walks right by them now he kills two cops outside teenagers house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend  there is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage if any other profession put out work of this low quality they would be fired yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash,negative,0
i liked the quiet noir of the first part the acting of pacino and cusak especially their scenes together the moodiness of the setting and the juxtaposition of the old pol and the idealistic youth was effecting i wish bridget fonda had more scenes in the movie she was an earnest and appealing character the film went off the rails for me when the assistant mayor starting snooping around the mafioso to get to the bottom of something his boss clearly didnt want him meddling in nobody in their right mind would meet a mafioso on an abandoned dock in a junkyard here the story became implausible something that i dont understand why did the cop and vito have a shootout if the latter was delivering info that could bring down the corrupt judge,positive,1
its been 3 months and you know what that meansa new seagal movie seagal has really been on role making horrible film after horrible film each time every movie getting worse and worse hes really amazing i dont really know what to say about tyd first its a piece of crap the story makes no sense at all secondly he uses stunt men in all his fight scenes and last but not least a lot of the footage is taken from other movies it amazes how this guy continues to find work he comes to the set late and leaves early and because of that his films are full of plot holes and stunt men why do we continue to buy his movies why do we continue to have hope that maybe just maybe he will make a great movie,negative,0
i have seen many of shahrukhs movies and this is a very good role for him he has such versatility but he mainly stays in positive roles as rahul he is very dark and disturbing yet i found myself sympathizing with him much of the movie if for nothing else watch this movie for shahrukh he plays a very complex and real character very convincingly the story is very typical and has been done before but the character development is very strong and entertaining the opening is a little confusing but by the end it doesnt matter the songs i found very likable and give insight to what characters are thinking very clever i think this movie was very good and recommend it to all shahrukh khan fans it is a must see,positive,1
its telling that as of the entry of this comment no females have submitted a vote of any kind for this movie not surprisingly cheesy science fiction doesnt appeal to them quite as much if you like a good b movie and especially if you like to satirize them as you watch you will like this if you dont have fun watching bad movies this ones not for you,negative,0
yes be my love was mario lanzas skyrocket to fame and still is popular today his voice was strong and steady so powerful in fact that mgm decided to use him in the great caruso lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of caruso having read the book by kostelanitz who wrote a biography of lanza he explains that the constant practise and vocal lessons became the visionary caruso to lanza there is no doubt that lanza did a superb job in the story but the story is not entirely true blame it on hollywood i used to practise singing his songs years ago and became pretty good myself until i lost my voice because of emphysemaasthma ten years ago reaching the high note of be my love is not easy but beautiful,positive,1
this movie is well made it is beautiful and wise it is heartwarming it is great and again it shows how great peter falk is he is fantastic and he even gets better the older he gets thank you peter falk thank you very much for this gem of a movie   this movie entertains there is lot of wisdom in this movie there is lot of humor in this movie there is life in this movie and meaning this movie shows how life can be  peter falk is in that movie he is just great where is the oscar for peter falk he deserves it so very much  peter falk just turned 80 i do sincerely hope that there will be more movies  walter j langbein,positive,1
out of boredom and vast curiosity i decided to check this show out today since my four year old niece loves it i should have known that it was a show that only a four year old could like the show was pretty bad  first of all the show just wasnt funny the laugh track went off at the most inappropriate times which was very annoying especially since none of the jokes were funny the laugh track went off at some point when the one kid whos the cameraman said im going to go polish my lense how the hell is that funny the parts in it like meat drumming that were supposed to be funny was just stupid to anyone whos over the age of eleven  now i have a feeling that four year olds are not the target audience however since i have a four year old niece who watches it this sort of thing concerned me while i was watching it it doesnt show very good behavior in the episode i was watching it shows sam stealing carlys sandwich and pushing her down to the ground just so carly can stand up and do the same thing back to her i would not want to see my niece acting that rude i also dont like the idea of two young girls having a web show where they give out personal information if this was real there would be freaks all over her  this show would probably be good and funny to someone whos eleven or younger but anyone older than that just stay away from it ill give this two stars since i guess i can see how it can be funny to a kid,negative,0
so this ugly guy with long nasty hair and his girlfriend end up in this house and they argue and argue about his old girlfriend there was suppose to be something scary in it but i didnt see anything scary at all there is some mention of a demon from the sea but that doesnt go anywhere at all i wish it did because then it wouldve taken the tension away from the jealous love triangle the title of the movie makes it look like it would be a scary and exciting movie but it is so far from it that i couldnt believe it i waited and waited for it to end and was so happy when it did it did not live up to the title like it should have so boo hoo hoo the cover had a cool picture but i shouldnt judge a cheesy movie by its cover,negative,0
this wasis an incredible movie with incredible cast music singing story etc it is a tragedy that some arrogant families the gerswhins or premingers can keep it from being available to generation after generation i have wanted to see it again all of my life i just found this site and read why it has not been available shame on these families for their pettiness my wife is from germany and she has never seen the movie neither have my stepchildren or my grandchildren it is very sad that a movie of this depth and quality is not available for them to see where do these families get off making such a conceited selfimportant egotistical condescending decision to prohibit generations from enjoying this film these stars these performances this music release the video and let them world judge and enjoy,positive,1
this is absolutely the worst movie ive seen all year  first i will say that the acting was very good and by all of the cast  this was apparently meant to be very offbeat and in that regard it succeeded by the same token the story revolves around a selfcentered wannabe who is a clueless talentless chronic liar whose source of self confidence comes from a pair of leather slippers  this was worse than watching a car wreck,negative,0
let me say first of all that i spent a total of about two minutes of my life on a skateboard before i realized i was totally uncoordinated ive always thought it was cool watching cats that know how to get extreme on em do their stuff but ive never been a skateboarder and have never really followed the sport that being said i thought this was a very informative and interesting documentary some reviewers have said that these dudes were sort of waving their own flag a bit but what the hell it looks to me that these guys probably deserve as much credit as anyone for giving the skateboarding world a jolt and theyve provided some good footage of their innovations to back it up its great the way viewers are allowed to see these guys both then and now and the footage they shot while they were teens growing up in california provides some interesting nostalgia that goes a bit beyond the sport of skating i never would have realized where extreme skating came from but this films sort of ties all the pieces together and gives us an informative documentary im sure its at least a tad biased but arent all documentaries worth watching for anyone interested in the sport or as in my case anyone who grew up in the 1970s,positive,1
dont be fooled by the silly title folks this is one sweet ride a true successor to tetsuo the iron man and ichi the killer this gem starts with a bang and lays the gore on thick until the credits roll it seems that aliens are taking over peoples bodies and modifying them into warmachines which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game for the amusement of their species the winner of the battle eats the loser alive thats mostly it for plot but who cares when the gore is this good i have no idea how many buckets of slime were used but its disgusting to behold there is interesting and effective use of stopmotion when the takeovers are in progress and loving care is lavished on all of the creature and makeup effects the cgi is a bit limited but that actually doesnt detract from the overall quality one bit at least for me this was truly a fun and stomachturning film that deserves much praise and has truly earned its place in the stack of cult classics find it and watch you wont be disappointed,positive,1
the movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike  but are not in any way expect for being smart  one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the title  i honestly didnt like the style of the movie i believe that anxiety confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose but what i dont get is why there is so much of it the movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all it gives the comic book like experience however its visually numbing the viewer it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs monotonic scenes dynamic cut music and abrupt noises  the movies storyline is very simple most of whats going on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cuts  i will say openly that this movie didnt meet my expetations a tiny bit,negative,0
wow what can i say about this film its a lousy piece of crap im surprised that it got rated as high as it did whats wrong with this film heres a better question whats not wrong with this film  the story itself is just crap and cliché heres pretty much what its aboutsome kinda nerdy kid with no friends gets picked on gets killed and comes back as a scarecrow for revenge all of that is packed into 86 minutes of worthless film if you havent seen this movie dont waste your time watching it also the second one isnt much better so dont bother watching that eitheri rated this movie a three because i liked the scarecrows outfit not because there was anything good about the movie i think you get the picture,negative,0
 so i thought id throw in a few words about william mcnamara not a bad way to spend a couple of hours if you want to see him in his tightywhities  its obvious he pumped up for this role and he looks pretty darn good in them  or less theres an extended sequence in a cave where he has to strip down to his undies theres a nice bit where he has to chase after miss eleniak in the buff with only his hands cupped over his groin william mcnamara is naturally a little on the skinny side but he has a nice generous handful of a booty also theres a moment when hes getting out of bed that if you pause the action at just the right moment you can see the whole enchilada if youre inclined to do so and come on half of the people who choose to watch a movie about navy men on a road trip are id just like thank dennis hopper for his equal opportunity gratuitous nudity can william mcnamara act heck if i know,negative,0
running out of time is probably as close to a perfect film as youre ever likely to see out of hong kong all the elements click a terrific script by french writers julien carbon and laurent courtiaud that even manages to subvert the odd cliché reliably imaginative direction by johnnie to and excellent central performances by andy lau and lau ching wan the latter displaying his great comic timing to wonderful effect without ever crossing the line into parody especially in his exasperated reactions to his superiors abysmal negotiating skills the supporting cast is fine too with yo yo mung making a strong impression in a tiny role and even the often histrionic waise lee looking remarkably and very aptly like a bald andy lau reining it in to good effect its best not to know too much about the plot going in beyond the basic setup  with only a few weeks to live lau engages in a criminal game with wans cop with no easily apparent motive  and just sit back and enjoy the ride its certainly worth the fare it also has one of the most perfect love stories in recent movies and played in a mere three scenes the second bus ride is one of the most magical moments of filmmaking ive seen in ages theres also a fine score by raymond wong as well the most fun playing cat and mouse at the movies in years,positive,1
any movie that offers bonnie hunt sarah silverman and amy sedaris in the supporting cast has to be well worth watching and comic actor jeff garlin takes advantage of the terrific talent he recruited for his 2007 directorial debut a sadsack comedy about an overweight man who feels out of step with the world around him familiar as larry davids manager jeff on curb your enthusiasm garlin plays james a stillstruggling 39year old chicago actor who still lives with his widowed mother his selfesteem is so low that he cant meet women but its the comical way he views his single status that makes his dilemma involving if the storyline sounds a bit familiar thats because the film is partially a tribute to the 1955 ernest borgnine classic marty about a lonely bronx butcher living with his meddlesome mother in fact garlin uses marty as the play which james is desperate to do since he is so empathetic to the characters situation  naturally there is a love story of sorts in this new millennium version and silverman plays beth an offkilter sexually voracious ice cream parlor server who takes him on an underwear shopping spree their best scene together is in his favorite convenience store where they improvise different characters in different aisles hunt plays a lonely elementary school teacher who shares a passion with james for jazz musician ben webster they meet accidentally in a record store and then again at a career day at her school where he hilariously exposes his sexual neuroses in front of a classroom of firstgraders including his best friend lucas pert daughter penelope played by dakota fannings lookalike baby sister elle in a wedgedin cameo and looking quite a bit like jerri blank sedaris plays the schools counselor who speaks to james after his inappropriate monologue david pasquesi plays luca a retirement home manager and his scenes with garlin have an easy rapport that makes their friendship easy to believe almost stealing the movie is character actress mina kolb who plays james pixilated mother with pluck and heart  there are also unexpected cameos from teen idol aaron carter and gina gershon dont askbut the setup is funny as well as sharply played bits by director paul mazursky as the snaky director of a candidcameratype show smear job tim kazurinsky as the unsuspecting victim of that show and dan castellaneta as the toughlove convenience store owner with his rueful bouts of insecurity and selfloathing garlins comic sensibilities resemble those of albert brooks and the casual dialogue at its best reminds me of modern romance and defending your life the one persistent problem i had with the film is pacing as some scenes dragged out longer than necessary the problem is more evident in the first half when garlin is trying to establish the right tempo and the lack of real conflict adds to the sluggishness regardless what he does well is capture that gnawing sense of desperation one feels upon the revelation that life is not what it is supposed to be that a significant other may be out of reach and that a steady diet of junk food eaten on a car hood is the only sure thing when it comes to gratification,positive,1
you would really need to remember the monkees and have a clear understanding as to where and how they fitted into the second half of the 1960s in order to fully appreciate this movie  there is no plot as such basically its a crazy mixed up pastiche of various unrelated sequences but it is interesting and entertaining in its own peculiar way once you get onto its wavelength in short it was a classic cleverly conceived and well crafted example of late 60s experimental cinema it contains some good songs some ultragroovy cinematography and plenty of other worthwhile ideas in terms of film technique  i give it 7 out of 10 for several reasons first it took a lot of courage to make such an unorthodox movie in the commercial mainstream where both its stars and its producers were firmly ensconced at the time if a feature movie flops at the box office the consequences can be dire for all concerned secondly it was for the most part a creative success and finally as already mentioned it is unquestionably a classic of the genre and as such it is now historically important  unfortunately head came too late in the monkees career but there again they would not have been allowed to make it earlier on because it was essentially a very pointed and cynical satire of their own image   clearly the members of the group knew only too well that the whole monkees juggernaut had just about run its race when they started work on this project in a way it was to be their swan song and they were determined to let it all hang out they were tired of being treated like mere pawns in the high powered corporate game in which they had been manipulated and exploited over the preceding few years in short they wanted out and they were going to say a few things before they left  history however has vindicated the band let the critics be damned the monkees left behind some of the best most polished and successful pop records of the decade yes they had plenty of help but at the end of the day they stood in front of the studio mikes they fronted the movie and tv cameras and they did the concerts they were fun and just a little bit crazy but unlike some of their contemporaries they were never threatening you could safely introduce a monkey to your elderly aunt  head probably borrows a bit too heavily from the beatles hard days night but its still worth another look for those who were around at the time or for younger retrophiles who have the ability to appreciate its significance  enjoy,positive,1
i like british humor i believe its one of the best in the world i like almost every british sitcom okay maybe not monthy python some of the jokes were great but some of them i didnt understand but this league of gentlemen is just something good to make you sick this show was good in some way it helped me lost some weight because watching this piece of garbage make me feel im not hungry anymore this is really just disgusting sick and not even funny tv show and i wonder who is actually laughing at this stuff i watched it for about 10 minutes and turned it off it was so disgusting watching men dressed in the woman with yellow teeth and urinating on the car i mean whats so funny about that it makes me wanna puke no humor just disturbing images and cheap toilet laughs i dont know if you like this stuff you go ahead watch it but to be honest people watching and enjoying this must have some emotional problems garbage,negative,0

no more corned beef and cabbage for her  this little romantic comedy clips along from scene to scene with a few exotic twists some imaginary scenes and a costume party all of this is centered around the wife of the husbands who is looking to break out of the doldrums played by gloria swanson she is twenty here both the leading men have a natural air that is convincing and of course swanson is perfect in all kinds of moods from frivolous to worried to hopeful   behind all the games and apparent lightheartedness is that old serious problem of staying in love and not straying in love theres a little corniness but director demille is on top of keeping it snappy and believable in all as with many films from this period the subtitles do not just tell what they are saying or thinking but often give a kind of philosophical insight as if to justify the tragedy or raciness and there is that higher purpose here probably better without the instructional text but its part of the narrative style and its kind of quaint   if you are looking for visual or formal amazement you wont find it here but as a story well acted and filmed with precision and economy its really a great example the events might not come as a total surprise but its such a modern love story set almost a hundred years ago its a gas and did i saw swanson was perfect,positive,1
this trashy b movie attempts to masquerade as a study of sexual addiction but it is really a poor excuse for a sexploitation flick the story revolves around sammy horn subtle name played by michael des barres sammy is a restaurant owner with a clueless wife grace rosanna arquette and a young child he has a sexual addiction and must have meaningless sex every five minutes with any woman in his field of vision who will agree and of course every woman on the planet finds him irresistible despite the fact that he looks old enough to be collecting social security  the story is centered on a conversation with his therapist nastassja kinski where he is describing each of his sexual exploits via flashback this is nothing more than a convenient launching point for a parade of serial sex acts which consumes at least 75 of the screen time  it is hard to know where to begin criticizing a film this bad the production values are abysmal the movie is shot on video with a look somewhere between a tv soap opera at best and an amateur porn flick shot in someones garage the direction by joseph brutsman is horrible with bad lighting uninspired framing and poor actor direction the script is vapid and the dialogue mindless and vulgar  women are generally portrayed as sex obsessed nymphomaniacs just waiting for an addict like sammy to come along and rough them up while feeding their insatiable appetites with some impersonal copulation as an example graces sister comes over to indignantly inform sammy that she knows hes been sleeping around and that she is going to tell his wife his response to that is to throw her up against the wall and begin raping her about three seconds into it she has an epiphany and is instantly converted to one of his sex disciples begging him to give her more just as they finish grace walks in and sis says to her oh great to see you gotta run to pick up timmy and mums the word about sammys indiscretions the bond of loyalty has been sealed with a good ravishment no spoiler here because it is so typical of the obvious nature of the film that anyone who had seen the first fifteen minutes could have predicted it  the sex depictions are all overdone mechanical and so poorly simulated that they are more comical than erotic most of them are done with both participants fully clothed the acting is wretched michael des barres presents all the depth of a rain puddle he really seems to get into the thrusting and profanity of the sex parts but when it comes to actually acting with arquette and kinski he is adrift rosanna arquette is the closest thing to an actor in this film giving a bearable performance and looking genuinely hurt when she finally discovers that her perfect husband is a lecherous animal nastassja kinski is far too compassionate as the therapist but at least we have some acting happening here the rest of the cast is just a collection of elevated body doubles to whom they give thought provoking lines like hit me harder is that the best you can do and oh godyes  this movie is among the worst i have ever seen a dubious distinction given the thousands of films i have viewed i have given it the extremely rare dishonor of rating it 110 not to be seen within three hours of any meal,negative,0

this feels like a featurelenght treatment of a comedyroutine that could have also been told in a tenminute short also technical credits are suppar the film really feels like a film school diploma project  the cast is a mix of seasoned stage pros and talented newcomers but the problems is the superficial scrip their lines feel constructed exactly like cued tv show material  the director fails to take his protagonists seriously therefore we are not touched by their problems and conflicts  the film has been cleverly marketed and offers a unique selling point but in the end the film disappoints on all levels,negative,0

elegance and class are not always the first words that come to mind when folks at least folks who might do such a thing sit around and talk about film noir   yet some of the best films of the genre out of the past the killers in a lonely place night and the city manage a level of sleek sophistication that elevates them beyond a moody catch phrase and its connotations of foreboding shadows fedoras and femmefatales   where the sidewalk ends a fairly difficult to find film  the only copy in perhaps the best stocked video store in manhattan was a rough bootleg from the amc cable channel  belongs in a category with these classics  from the moment the black cloud of opening credits pass a curtain is drawing around rogue loner detective marc dixons crumbling world and as the moments pass it inches ever closer threatening suffocation   sure hes that familiar cop with a dark past but dana andrews gives dixon a bleak stare and troubled intensity that makes you as uncomfortable as he seems and yeah hes been smacking around suspects for too long and the newly promoted chief karl malden in a typically robust and commanding outing is warning him for the last time   yet dixon hates these thugs too much to stop now and boy didnt they had have it coming   hoods dusters mugs gutter nickelrats he spits when that tough nut of a boss demotes him and rolls out all of the complaints the bureau has been receiving about dixons right hook the advice is for him to cool off for his own good but instead he takes matters into his own hands   and what a world of trouble he finds when he relies on his instincts and falls back on a nature that may or may not have been passed down from a generation before   right away hes in deep with the cops the syndicate his own partner dixons questionable involvement in a murder investigation threatens his job makes him wonder whether he is simply as base as those he has sworn to bring in like bogart in lonely place can he escape what he is  when he has nowhere else to turn he discovers that he has virtually doomed his unexpected relationship with a seraphic beauty the marvelous gene tierney who seems as if she can turn his barren bachelors existence into something worth coming home to   the pacing of this superb film is taut and gripping the group of writers that contributed to the production polished the script to a high gloss  the dialogue is snappy without disintegrating into dated parody fodder passionate without becoming melodramatic or sappy   and all of this topnotch direction and acting isnt too slick or buffed to loosen the films emotional hold gene tierneys angelic softfocus beauty is used to great effect she shows herself to be an actress of considerable range and her gentle kind nature is as boundless here as is her psychosis in leave her to heaven the scenes between tierney and andrewss dixon grow more intense and touching the closer he seems to selfdestruction   near the end of his rope cut bruised and exhausted dixon summarizes his lot innocent people can get into terrible jams too he says one false move and youre in over your head   perhaps what makes this film so totally compelling is the sense that things could go wildly wrong for almost anyone  especially for someone who is trying so hard to do right  with one slight shift in the wind one wrong decision or punch or most frighteningly due to factors you have no control over noir has always reflected the darkest fears brought them to the surface where the sidewalk ends does so in a realistic fashion   one nitpick of an aside this otherwise sterling film has a glaringly poor dub of a blonde model that wouldnt seem out of place on mystery science theater how very odd   but noir fans  heck any movie fans  who havent seen this one are in for a terrific treat,positive,1
i liked this a lot in fact if i see it againand i plan to i just may love it ill echo other reviewers in saying that this movie really does grow on you as you watch it starts kind of slowly but the way in enfolds is very natural and has a mood to it you just get into it  i really liked the summery atmosphere to the movie and thought the movie was very touching as a whole the characters have a strong element of realism and the movie very slowly and gently weaves a spell as you get involved in the various interactions between them all and want to know how it will ultimately turn out and what paths the characters will choose to take   i am very surprised that there are less then a dozen comments on thisthere are obscure tv movies that have more comments then rich in love  one thing that i will say is i missed the ending which is driving me crazy and i have to watch it again to see that this is a movie that may not be for everybody but that i feel is strongly underratedeven some of my most film buff purist friends who have seen almost every movie there is havent seen this and it doesnt even seem to have much of a message board but i liked it a lot and to all those who like family dramas that are warm on scenery atmosphere and an unhurried languid pace should probably take a look at this especially note worthy is that it takes place in south carolina so for those like me who love the south and movies that take place there this is a gem ill add my vote to the woefully few comments and recommend this little known flick,positive,1
i watched the world premiere of this on the starz action channel they call it vampires the turning the plot was a little confusing there is a voiceover in the introduction about an 800 year war and i didnt quite understand the movie is about a young couple somewhere in asia maybe in china i dont think the movie specifies the couple has an argument and meredith monroe runs off and is kidnapped by a biker gang of vampires the boyfriend finds a group of vampires that dont kill humans and enters into a battle with the bikers a human group of slayers somehow get involved and the final fight sequence takes place during a solar eclipse this movie is not related to either vampires or vampires los muertos confusing but decent action four out of 10 stars,negative,0

what a waste of a great cast figured id check it out because it looked like a good stoner comedy with a lot of fairly wellknown actors what it turned out to be was a pointless collection of boring intertwining stories about several characters with minimal connections with each other characters who start off looking like decent people but end up with not a single likable or interesting characteristic among them calling it a comedy was a stretch as wellthe only thing that made me chuckle was jack blacks song which was basically tenacious d i waited for something big to happen but ended up with nothing more than 97 minutes of my life wasted,negative,0
when i first saw this film around 6 months ago i considered it interesting but little more but it stuck with me that interest grew and grew and i wondered whether my initial boredom and response had more to do with the actual vhs quality rather than the film itself i purchased the criterion dvd box set and it turns out that i was right the second time alexander nevsky is a great film it is rousing and im sure it succeeded in its main aim propaganda against the germans  that is the most common criticism against this film and against eisenstein that it is merely propagandist and nothing else its untrue he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived by now the world is far enough beyond joseph stalin to be able to watch eisensteins films as art,positive,1
being american i have not been exposed to this character before which is good because some of you have been disappointed i have nothing to compare it to i have found no enjoyment in the mindless idiot humor in the american teen movies and although this is a slightly similar type of humor i couldnt stop laughing i hardly ever laugh out loud at a movie and usually a movie has a few funny parts for me but this movie was funny from start to finish my only disappointment was when it was over im actually going to buy this on dvd when i find it,positive,1

perhaps we are too much attached to great spectacles when we hear of antiquity brought to screen perhaps we expect too much from these films however if we as viewers are offered far too little what happens then   that is what i thought after seeing imperium  nerone by paul marcus a part of the production series on the roman empire augustus by roger young the first imperium movie included at least peter otoole but what does this movie include  hardly anything accurate the historical errors are so serious that the movie changes facts and constitutes rather a distorted image of the roman empire than the true history throughout the movie we see nero young young man during the allegedly long reign of caligula young man during the reign of claudius and finally during his own historically 14 year long reign andhe dies the same according to the movie nero born during the reign of tiberius lives for more than 40 years but looks to be in his late twenties when he dies continuity combined with made up history is the biggest problem of the movie which makes it hardly logical not to say reliable nero loses his father is raised by slaves at that time his mother agrippina is exiled by caligula later however she suddenly marries emperor claudius who already has big children with freshly married to him messalina at these moments of the movie we see acte rike schmid neros mistress all right it is historically accurate yet no source proves that she played such a decisive role in the rise of christianity in rome in the film she is not only a devoted christian but even a witness of st pauls miracle he brings a young girl marzia back to life besides there was historically nothing like nero seen on the court of caligula since nero was born in caligulas 4 year long reign ad 3741 i understand that movies may change something but such an error makes the script absolutely unreliable and many many other shortcomings concerning content that are hard to enumerate but after 30 minutes of watching this film i doubted whether i was watching a historical movie or a total fantasy  as for its artistic features which supply us with entertainment they are equally lame as the history here is the performances are artificial the cast simply have beautiful faces but weak acting abilities perhaps i am too much attached to peter ustinov or charles laughton in the lead but hans matheson does not fit as nero at all he could have some of the good moments as an actor but never as the infamous roman emperor is he an artist who burns rome for a song is he a cynic who disguises the love to his relatives is he a cruel ruler who sacrifices the lives of thousands of innocent people for the sake of alleged justice none of these he is just a young man who does not know how to rule and in the long run begins to release the fire burning within himself john simm is out of place in this film as caligula and absolutely inferior to other portrayals of the character elisa tovati is only sexy as poppaea yet she could have been much much better the costumes are inaccurate and the sets do not amaze low budget results in low effects and consequently low entertainment  but what made me most angry in this movie and as a result i give it 110 are some moments that are absolutely unacceptable   the death of poppaea and st pauls talk with nero at her dead body    claudius mention of the current conquest of britannia on the feast and soon his death he conquered britannia while messalina was his wife much before his death    tigellinus killing agrippina laura morante neros mother    neros arguments in the speech to the senators    finally neros death  a calm day at the lake and an indifferent suicide that leads to a moral said by acte let us forgive him  all in all this film is a waste of time and is absolutely unneeded as yet another production concerning the roman empire its better to make one good film in 30 years than ten minor little ones in 5 years 110  should not have been made at all,negative,0
i was browsing through the movies on demand and saw underdog for free and it was only 82 minutes long so i decided to watch it i wasnt expecting much but it exceeded my expectations of being awful everything about the movie was cringe worthy the dialogue was atrocious including many terrible puns the jokes were also terrible i found myself yelling and flipping off my television screen while i was suffering through this trash it hit its target audience very well but i dont see how anyone else could enjoy this film it made me very angry and nearly cry because of everything terrible this film had going for it  the only enjoyable thing about this movie was being able to give it a 110 after viewing it i beg you to avoid it at all costs i understand the fact that its made for kids but there is nothing likable about it at all,negative,0
this film is an absolute classic for camp that is why it was an elvira and mst3000 classic everyone knows the story scientist keeps his girlfriends head alive in a lasagna pan in his basement while he cruises town and tries to find her a body by checking out the local chicks finally he finds a real hourglass body with a scarfaced chicks head on top the severed head makes friends with the failed experiment in the closet and the conehead comes out of the closet and rips off the assistants remaining good arm his other is not right from a scientists earlier failure and the whole place burns down  the movie scared us so much as kids that my friend wouldnt go into his basement for a year after seeing it as kids we ranked the scariest movies of all time and this one was number four only one of those scary movies was really any good the original the haunting  i had to give this movie a seven rating for the tremendous amount of entertainment value it offers its eerie effect because of the crappy production and the weird sexual angle when the scientist looks for the bodies complete with porno sound track scares the hell out of innocent children while the ridiculous aspects make it prime material for watching talking and laughing i could watch this film tonight and enjoy it while id rather go to the dentist than watch chicago again  seven is the most i can give it because its entertainment value is mere luck the film  as cinema is a disaster,positive,1

this movie is a quite fair adaptation of the prosper merimeés novel in the novel merimeé himself is a character don josé is from navarra north spain and historically a basque country zone they can speak basque language they are in seville andalusia south spain and they only speak spanish with andalusian accent in no way they speak basque but carmen explains to don josé that she was living in navarra you can believe it or not anyway this is the books version then you cant be critical with the movie about this be with the book you have to note are different the novel by merimeé and the opera by bizet and this movie is an adaptation from the novel anyway in the opera don josé is still spanish from navarra never hes french why so many people keep thinking don josé is french i dont know but i guess because the novel and the opera are in french although is supposed to be in spanish  the only important difference between the movie and the novel is that in the movie don josé also kills the torero lover of carmen and in the novel he doesnt neither in the opera i guess they wanted to keep the movie a little more gore i think the movie is quite good anyway,positive,1
one of the funnest marios ive ever played the levels are creative there are fluid controls and good graphics for its time theres also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight sometimes the levels get frustrating and if you leave out some of the hard levels and still need to get more accomplished to fight a boss it can be annoying another complaint is the camera angle though it works fairly well most of the time it can be a pain in certain situations if your a big time mario fan this ones for you even if your not a huge fan of him id still recommend this one its a big game and getting what you need can take a while but its very satisfying good for playing in short bursts of time it will almost certainly hold your interest it sure does hold mine,positive,1
im not the type of person to watch tv shows because the acting normally sucks or its unrealistic or too dramatic but this show is perfect everyone can act and you can relate to the characters and their situations everyone has their own personality and lorelai gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny rory gilmore is a good role model for all girls she takes pride in wanting to attend harvard and boysboyfriends always come second in her book shes a loyal friend and always the peace maker theres subtle romance which is what i like personally not the mushy gushy romance that not many people get to have in their lives but a realistic type of romance every character eventually gets it and they dont find their prince charming at first glance and they dont just fall in love with every guy that comes their way its a realistic show but when you watch it you better brush up on your movies pop culture and random facts because lorelai gilmore is always making references i fell in love with this show and if you give it a chance so will you,positive,1
i watched this mini in the early eighties sam waterson proved himself to be a great actor in fact when he began law and order i was disappointed in him as it was not as powerful a role unfortunately the good roles do not pay the bills i wish i could find a copy of this rare series and review it it is both factual and entertaining everyone should see it to know what really happened i was so moved i purchased and read the book pppenheimershatterer of worlds and saw how this man became an unlikely hero who was never rewarded for his insight if you get a chance be sure to watch this movie and see what a performance mr waterston can really provide an audience enjoy the movies,positive,1
in the unlikely case that some aspiring directors are reading these comments id like to offer some advice free of charge from a viewers perspective if you want to make a serious exotic adventure film do it if you want to make a spoof of exotic adventure films go ahead do not try to make both at the same time it doesnt work for example having a goofy comic relief character killed and beheaded and following it up with a monkey shaking a tree and dropping a coconut on a cannibals head just makes you look like you had no idea what kind of movie you wanted to make this one is boring meandering cheap racistyou get the picture a couple of smart moments and a few glimpses of nudity from kathy shower way too prissy here are hardly worth your trouble there is a reason everyone has forgotten about this films existence 12,negative,0
caution may contain spoilers  ive seen this movie 3 times  ive liked it every time upon seeing it again im always reminded of how good it is an hbo tv movie very well done like most of their movies are this wouldve gotten oscars for its performances had it been released for general distribution instead of made for tv  as im sure anyone knows from reading other reviews here this is the story of serial murderer andrei chikatilo he murdered 56 people over 8 years in the former soviet union 3 victims were buried  couldnt be found so he was only convicted of 52 out of 53 of his murders the story actually focuses more on the forensic analyst victor burakov played to perfection by stephen rea a man that becomes tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional obstacles placed by party hacks his part is essential to be sure there is a very touching scene towards the end of the movie that mentions how in america investigators are routinely taken off serial killer cases after 18 months whether they want to or not due to the mental strain  frustration according to this acct burakov worked for over 5 years before getting his first break from it he followed the case to its conclusion 3 years later in this scene his superior general fetisov played by donald sutherland actually tells him he admires his dedication and apologizes for not knowing he shouldve given him a break sooner  reas performance is so well done he doesnt overact chew up the scenery or do anything that distracts from his portrayal of a man who is hell bent on finding his killer he is a man with passion but doesnt show it in the same manner as is so usually portrayed in detective movies he only occasionally gives outbursts after quietly putting up with more than most could stand under such circumstances rea does so much with his face his eyes he doesnt need to overact he just is  his character so frustrated after so long at one point driven to frustration he actually says hed rather find 3 at one time than none in a year of course what he means is not that he wants more people to die he just wants some clues to catch this man rea makes us feel for this man he makes us understand but a glimpse of what it is to live with such horror and futility  a mutant to be sure chikatilos childhood was one which produces such monsters the character of chikatilo is very well done by jeffrey demunn he somehow impossible though it may seem elicits some modicum of sympathy for himself perhaps he is the worst of us gone terribly wrong either way his performance is very well done  donald sutherland as colonel fetisov later promoted to general also does a great job he starts out seeming to be a cynical worldly official that doesnt seem much more interested in helping the investigation than anyone else blocking burakov but he eventually becomes more than just an assistant he actually actively participates in helping burakov there is also a very nice turn by max von sydow as the psychiatrist brought in to help profile and figure out what kind of deviant they are looking for  although this movie deals with a morbid grotesque and violent story it really is more about what it takes to catch a killer than the killer himself all around a very well done movie with fine performances and a great screenplay the screenplay manages to do what the best of this type of movie does give factual events  place them meaningfully inside a dramatic framework that makes you feel like you know the people behind the facts  9 out of 10 stars,positive,1
this was amongst the worst films i have ever encountered the cinematography was dull with long tedious shots like a camera on a tripod filming a stage play interspersed with dramatic angles that made little sense to the content on screen the editing was terrible scenes matched together with the delicacy of a butcher the plot hinged on the viewer being familiar with the historical night in which mary shelley wrote frankenstien the acting was forced with the type of character development that left you with an intense interest in seeing each of them die horribly the sooner the better,negative,0
ill be honest with yall i was a junior in high school when this sitcom first aired on abc i didnt think i would like it at all but with john ritter in it i felt that it had a little potential in it plus their was something else with it i liked the acting was great not a lot of horrible 2nd rated comedy lines john ritter always brings his a game when it comes to comedy  this was a great show to watch and ill tell you why it was a great show my father who never watches sitcoms at all he just watches movies sports and law  order he actually sat down with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters my mother and myself and watched the show i think because john ritter was in it i honestly think this show would still be running if john ritter god rest his soul i wish he hadnt passed away,positive,1
wow   this film is the best living testament i think of what happened on 91101 in nyc compared to anything shown by the major media outlets  those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside this film shows you what happened on the inside   it begins with a focus on a rookie new york fireman waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight the subject matter turns abruptly with the only existing footage of the first plane to hit the towers you are then given a frontrow seat as firefighters rush to the scene into the lobby of tower one   in the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane and tower twos subsequent fall you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby it is a sight you will not soon forget  heartrending tearjerking and very compelling from the first minute to the last 911 deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made  we must never forget  ,positive,1
i have always been a great admirer of nicolas roeg and walkabout is one of my favorite films this is a film version of roegs stage play and while most of the film takes place in a hotel room it still has some of roegs cinematic flare very unique story is about a famous actress theresa russell who after a hard nights work on a film in 1954 goes to a hotel to visit a famous professor michael emil and together in his hotel room they talk after awhile she wants to go to bed with him but as they start to get undressed her husband is banging on the door her husband is a famous exbaseball player gary busey and he wants to know what is going on the three of them in the hotel room talk about what is going on and what the future holds for them meanwhile a famous senator tony curtis is threatening to take away the professors papers if he doesnt testify at a hearing theresa russell is just excellent and while shes not trying exactly to impersonate marilyn monroe she does a wonderful job of exuding the phobias and nuances that monroe is very well known for one thing the film does is show her as not only a woman on the verge of a mental breakdown but show her as a physical wreck as well she talks of being unable to have children and at one point in the film she suffers a miscarriage you can make an excellent case that this is russells best performance and i probably wouldnt argue the film does an interesting thing in showing many flashbacks as the characters continue to talk about one thing and in the flashback we see one of many reasons for their actions busey also gives a good solid performance and it reminds me of what a strong persona he gives off on screen emil as the professor is a character that has many more things on his mind then we originally thought the last scene in this film is a demonstration of his darker side one of the highlights of the film for me is the little conversation he has with the elevator man will sampson of cuckoos nest and they discuss what cherokee indians think about at all times but of course the famous scene in this film is where russell demonstrates to emil how she does understand the theory of relativity and uses toys to show this the professor is delighted by her demonstration and so are we russell and roeg are married in real life and they do admirable work when they are in collaboration and this is probably their best film together good performances and a very interesting job of directing make this a challenging and visually thought provoking film,positive,1
a chicago couple dillon and dougherty are falsely accused of killing their daughter people begin to wonder if they did it the police investigate and find suspicious evidence the couple are maligned by the public and accused in the press the cops speculate that they are satanists and have ritually murdered their own daughter they are charged and brought to trial they are represented by publicityseeking lawyers who give them bad advice and bill them for 100000 the evidence presented against them is twisted or hidden by the police fabricated intimations of sexual abuse are presented their other child is taken away from them and put in a foster home dougherty is pregnant and gives birth to find her baby removed verdict she didnt do it but he did he goes to the slams with a sentence of 45 years  in the last third of the movie with dillon in jail and dougherty wondering what to do next we see people who have been antagonistic now slowly coming to the couples defense witnesses admit to having lied other facts are brought to light that finally result in dillons release the killer is never found though the movie gives us a thorough whacko as a plausible perp  this is a weeper from beginning to end nothing seems to go right for the couple oh there are a few happy moment maybe a party where everyone is glad to be together and tearing up with joy or some point of evidence in their favor is discovered and people hug one another but its never long before someone rushes through the door with more bad news and all the faces are frozen in tragic disbelief usually a fade to block follows there isnt necessarily anything wrong with moving tragedies although i cant imagine what pleasure we get out of seeing people suffer theres plenty of tragedy in shakespeare too i suppose whatever we find interesting about tragic stories lies in the way theyre told oh but i am fortunes fool romeo cries after killing juliets brother here we have dougherty running in her robe through a hospital corridor screaming wheres my baby there isnt any ambiguity or irony in the story  as im sure there must have been in the real life events on which its based people are either good or bad here or else theyre bad then they turn good  the film isnt aimed at exploring human quirkiness or the way things work out its aimed at wrenching tears from the audience the actors provide firstrate role models i cant remember the last movie in which i saw so many tears there are rivulets of tears showers of them cascades of them a veritable niagara of them a lake lacrymose of them  well ill give one example of the efficiency with which the movie is crafted dillon and dougherty hire a chicago cop who works on the side as a private investigator ed asner asner is sympathetic to them but he doesnt really accomplish much he seems to be in the movie not because of his importance to the case but because he can provide the victimized couple with a kind of philosophy  learn to live with it which is okay  and because he suffers from colorectal cancer so we can watch him take his medicine double over with pain and finally pass away  whats frustrating about the movie is that in focusing so intensely on the suffering of the couple it sidesteps one of the more important issues that it raises  the function of gossip in regulating private lives  gossip is a strange thing really if we call it gossip its bad but if we call it public opinion it sounds acceptable at the very least of course we all have convictions about issues that may or may not be justified as i write michael jackson is once again being brought to court accused of molesting a young boy and i wonder how many of us thrilled at the news and immediately assumed he was a pedophile but gossip isnt all bad either its like water when its properly controlled its a community asset we need gossip to keep each other in line it helps us to maintain public order but like water in a flood or a tsunami it is ruinous to a village when it rages out of control  this is a movie thats okay if youre not looking for too much in the way of insight into human nature its done so cleverly that given its goal its hard to argue with it,negative,0
joseph h lewis was one of the finest directors of film noir this is surely his best  it doesnt have some of the standard features of what we now call film noir though americanmade it is set entirely in england it lacks gangsters it lacks a femme fatale it does not lack crime  the title character answers an ad she is overjoyed that shell be making some money as a secretary instead she wakes up days later as the pawn in a frightening plot only a very strong person could survive such a terrifyingly unsettling ordeal and nina foch gives the sense of a strong woman as julia  part of the excitement comes from casting against type ms foch has an elegant manner she is no screaming cowering victim she is actually a bit icy and patrician albeit impecunious this makes her characters plight all the more believable  surely the single most fascinating element is the casting of dame may witty she was and is probably most famous for the charming title character in the lady vanishes she has a sweet manner and a harmless slightly dithering manner but here she is far from a heroine  george macready is excellent as her extremely troubled son the whole cast in fact is superb  it seems that this famous and brilliant movie was made almost by accident undoubtedly the director knew exactly what he was doing but he did it on a low budget that is the thrill and charm of film noir the real film noir it is small convincingly lowlife and in this case unforgettable,positive,1
code 46 is one of those scifi movies where the government controls who you are allowed to love and in fact will punish you if you try to procreate with the wrong person the haves and the havenots live in completely separate territories the powers that be can remove your memories etc weve seen this stuff before but thats ok no movie is 100 original this kind of premise is always fun to contemplate unfortunately just imagining such a future is more interesting than actually watching code 46 the characters are boring and rarely say anything interesting maybe thats commentary on a dehumanized future but its still dull to watch its sloooow  at times the imagery is nice but usually coupled with its evocative soundtrack just looks like a glorified perfume commercial code 46 also sometimes uses the kind of television camerawork that i find annoying you know two characters talk as the camera artlessly floats on one side two seconds later its floating on the other side of them in a vain attempt to keep your attention  my friends liked this movie if they tried to get me to watch it again i probably would not do so unless they agreed to pay me 50,negative,0
the ali g character works brilliantly within the confines of a comedy show but as a movie it doesnt work in the same way  dont get me wrong  this is a very funny movie full of biting witty dialogue that caricatures the modern british chav wonderfully well whilst providing the viewer with a hilarious if unrealistic story  one problem with this film is that the script and content is either fantastically brilliant or its embarrassing to watch when i say embarrassing i dont mean funny embarrassing a la office or extras but rather youll wish they hadnt included it in the final cut one example of this is the inclusion of a music video after the film has ended to the tune of this is how we do it whenever i watch the film i stop the dvd when it says the end and leave it at that  overall ali g indahouse is a good film worth watching a couple of times the script is enjoyable to an extent and there are no issues as far as acting goes however refinement is the key word here  ali g is a better television programme borat is a better film,positive,1
can anybody do good cgi films besides pixar i mean really animation looked antiquated by 2006 standards and even by 1995 toy story standards or maybe they spent all their budget on hugh jackman whatever their reasoning the story truly did suck  somehow hugh jackman is a rat  a rat that is flushed down a toilet yeah i know seems stereotypical but then the sewer mimicked the ways of london  to an extent throw in a promise of jewels  and an evil frog and you get a pathetic attempt at entertainment  i would like to say something entertained me maybe the hookup in the movie or maybe the happilyeverafter rat relationship but nothing did it had the talent but it blew up d,negative,0
i had no idea what this film was about or even knew that it existed until about 1 month ago when i stumbled upon when i was searching for other films that stared dominic monaghan i thought this film was a strange insight into the mind of a none sleeper and what hisher mind may be going through in the hours that they spend awake when the rest of the world around them is asleepit was an interesting film and a good part was played by domi believe that even though this film you cannot buy anywhere well ive never seen it anywhere you must see it if you ever get the chance because it will really make you think about those people around us that cannot sleep and have to suffer night after night of not been able to sleep or only get about 1 hour of sleep every night so overall it was an interesting film of good substance,positive,1
i am rating this an 8 because of the premise of the film the acting was fine there wasnt anyone that stood out as amazing or appalling it is disturbingly true that intelligent people are having less and less children or choose to have none at allwhereas dumb ass w in 04 supporters are procreating like rabbits and though i dont believe the earth will actually exist in 500 years i can see mike judges parodied prophet coming to be as life imitating art the world is being run by idiots and it will get worse as the intelligent freethinking people become the minority and the git er done fans outnumber them the proof is our farce of an election  but i digress if you are fortunate enough to have this playing in your city go see it i have paid my 750 plus popcorn to see far worse rubbish than this date movie or napoleon dynamite anyone there are laughs there are cringes but overall this is entertaining if you have half a brain you will think to yourself how this movie though funny is spot on accurate and a tiny bit uncanny im not surprised at all that this movie is almost completely unknown as fox was the one distributing this and they wouldnt want any of their sheep to see this and think maybe i will read a book and not watch next or cheaters or ow my balls if our society doesnt stop the dumbing down of everythingand the bastardisation of the english language ahem mr bush then this really is where we are going,positive,1
when i refer to malice as a film noir i am not likening it to such masterpieces as sunset boulevard double indemnity or the maltese falcon nor am i comparing director becker to alfred hitchcock stanley kubrick stanley kramer or luis bunuel i am merely registering a protest against the darkness that pervades this movie from start to finish to the extent that most of the time you simply cannot make out what is going on i can understand darkness in night scenes but this movie was dark even in broad daylight for what reason i am at loss to understand as it is however it wouldnt have made much difference if director becker had filmed it in total darkness,negative,0
wowsheer brilliance  turning a thrillersuspensehorror into comedy  after watching this i never laughed so hard at a horror movie beforea ridiculous plot with 3 characters that were just insanely developed  either not written in depth or too much depth  if you want to watch an absolutely written horror movie with stupid dialog messed up plot useless scenes wasted characters bad sound and lousy development overall then this is the one to watch  be sure to keep focused for the classic food processor scene and the totally inept police investigation scenes  this is a remarkable new low in screen performance and writing and to sit through it for the entire duration makes you either stupid daring or brave,negative,0
im just filling this comment out because i couldnt stand the fact that a positive comment was featured on the complete information page i really think this to be the worst movie ever made in my country this is not only because of the terrible plot the crappy english and a tensioncurve that is as flat as our country no it is because this was a serious attempt to make a good action movie conform the hollywood standard it had to be the european action movie of the yearfor this purpose they even hired fejda van huet actor in the academy award winning picture karakter to do the job i dont mind bad films i can even enjoy them if they are pretensiousless b movies but i cant stand movies that are terrible but supposed to be atype movies,negative,0
being of cephallonian descent i was happily surprised when watching the movie i have heard the true history from my relatives that still live in cephalonia but when watching the movie and reading the book the sketchy bits of history were filled it is all true the italians would sing the oppression and the earthquakes that rock the island so often the earthquake in 1953 killed my great grandfather and the book and movie both portray the feeling of the era with great compassion if you havent seen the movie go and watch it and read the book it is not only a love story and yes there were plenty of italians in love with cephallonian women in fact boat loads of cephallonian women were taken to italy after the war it is a true depiction of history,positive,1
i say remember where and when you saw this show because i believe if fox gives talk show a chance spike will be right up there with conan in a few years because like conan he is incredibly funny and seems to be just grateful at having his own show which adds to the humor  the funniest bits spike has had so far are the idiot paparatzi and comedy for stoners and if your not high and get cfs what does that say about you   in summary this show is funnier in 25 minutes than snl in an hour so lets hope talk show gets the attention it deserves such as an extra half hour more money and a band,positive,1
victor sjostrom who is the grandfather of swedish cinema directed this stark existentialist film about atonement betrayal death forgiveness guilt redemption and the bleakest moments of the human condition he stars as david holm a no goodnick who responds to a moment of kindness by returning to his drunken ways only to later have to bargain for his soul with the driver of the phantom carriage death  unlike many silent films during the period the film is nearly absent scenes with overacting the pacing does becomes tedious with its overly familiar dickensian narrative however examining the film in retrospect and in comparison to others of its time its a very daring and unique film audiences of the time were not exposed to such subject matter and the cinematography is tremendous symbolic and accompanied by double exposure effects and multilayered flashbacks its a genuinely creepy and frightening film for youngsters for sure  watching the film its easy to see the later influences this film had on swedish master ingmar bergman most of the great bergman themes are here on full display sjostrom of course later starred in bergmans masterpiece on alienation and loneliness wild strawberries this would be sjostroms final performance as an actor sjostrom based the script on a novel by swedish writer selma lagerlof  of 4 stars,positive,1
this movie is funny and sad enough i think that it is kinda true if you love office space then you will love this movie because it is another mike judge hit but it is nothing like office space i told every one to see this movie i only wish that it would have been in more theaters so it would have gotten the recognition it deserved i love this movie and would love to see more from mike judge luke wilson is also what makes this movie what it is i am so glad that i will not be alive in the year 2505 because if this movie turns out to be true we are all in for a lot of trouble i just hope more people see this movie because i know that they will fall in love with it too,positive,1
a matter of life and death what can you really say that would properly do justice to the genius and beauty of this film powell and pressburgers visual imagination knows no bounds every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions the switches between the bold colours of the real world to the stark black and white of heaven is ingenious showing us visually just how much more vibrant life is the final court scene is also fantastic as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over peter david nivens operation   all of the performances are spot on roger livesey being a standout and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful never has there been a more romantic film than this if there has i havent seen it a matter of life and death is all about the power of love and just how important life is and jack cardiffs cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone the way he lights kim hunters face makes her all the more beautiful what a genius he can make a simple things such as a game of table tennis look exciting and the sound design is also impeccable the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision way ahead of its time  this is a true classic that can restore anyones faith in cinema under appreciated on its initial release and by todays audiences but one of my all time favourites which is why i give this film a 1010 in a word  beautiful,positive,1

i actually first watched one dark night in the theater  wrote a review of the film for my high school newspaper i loved it then  i still love it the storyline revolves around two people first of all one woman learns that her father has telekenisis after his death she then has feelings herself about the strange powers of her father even in his death the mauseleum hes buried in plays host to the other main person a high school girl doing anything to get in with a group of girls that just want to torment her  dare her to stay in the mauseleum all night to join their group they go back in the night to scare her  find scares for themselves the cast is led by meg tilly with supporting roles by adam west and one of my personal favorites elizabeth daily aka eg daily check this one out if you love 80s movies  cheesy horror movies you wont be disatisfied,positive,1
why do i give this 1974 porn movie 7 points because i watched it and i found it hilarious aliens their weird spaceship their weird helmets my god was that a sight and all what these desperate alien women need is semen from the earth  and where do they look for it in upper bavaria germany and that is where the main fun comes from in europe and more so in germanspeaking countries bavaria is seen as a traditional and backward region and then the actors are so helpless with the alien women well there have been films about people being unable to deal with women like the american pie series  but what this film achieved is a true funny weirdness you constantly wonder how they came up with these crackpot ideas but it was 1974 and looking back 35 years fills one with a kind of nostalgia youve never seen a film like that  and if you dont mind seeing the casual pubic hairs and breasts watch it once it is a comedy essentially not a porn flick,positive,1
this is absolutely the best 80s cartoon ever maybe the best cartoon of all time it had everything action adventure thrill and much more  i cant imagine how hard it was for rubyspears company to make this great cartoon there has been spent a lot of money for this masterpiece of work and it was worth it for example just the beaming down scenes were hard because i wouldnt call the 1980s for a great technology year with computers like now in the world we live in so the beaming down scenes were excellent  the cartoons will never be the same as they were before that is why i hope that they all will be released on dvd specially the centurions as its my favorite i have the whole complete set of 65 episodes on dvdr but its not the same because if they were released on dvd the people in the world would be able to buy it and see the dvds in almost every store which means a lot to the fans my good friend ted made this petition to either get the show back on tv or better on dvd that is if we get many requests to get them back on dvd  so please help us by signing the petition at httpwwwpetitiononlinecom6600fpetitionhtml,positive,1
this series is set a year after the mission to abydos in the movie stargate it explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention such as how was the stargate activated without a human computer where did the goauld ras race come from how many are there   the first episode has a retired jack oneill spelled with 2 ls recalled to active duty by general george hammond due to an attack by the shut down stargate from apophis a powerful goauld who killed four men and kidnapped one woman we meet samantha carter a brilliant scientist who claims that she should have gone through the stargate the first time and is determined to go through now we find out that daniel got married on abydos and that there are hundreds of gate addresses that they can dial then daniels wife gets captured by apophis and becomes his new queen   it continues in the second episode where general hammond announces the formation of the sgc which includes nine teams in which jacks team will be sg1 which consists of jack samantha and daniel they go to chulak a goauld homeworld to rescue daniels wife and another one captured at abydos named skara they get captured and just as apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners a jaffa named tealc first prime of apophis saves them and goes to earth with them where he is made part of sg1   that was only the beginning of the adventure in the course of the show they have gone to the past and future gotten transported to alternate realities swapped bodies grown old met alien races which include a rebel alliance of goauld called the tokra in which samanthas dad becomes a member the asgard a cute little race in which we see thor most often hes jacks buddyand avoid global disaster by the skin of their teeth countless times  the show was recently canceled but lasted ten seasons in season nine a new enemy called the ori came in flaunting brand new powers new dangers and bringing to light new mysteries surrounding the stargate and its creators the ancients season nine and ten also saw the introduction to two new characters ben browder as cameron mitchell the new leader of sg1 and claudia black as vala maldoran a female human from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team   very wellproduced interesting characters fantastic special effects and a subtle love interest between samantha and jack this one has it all a different way of travelling the galaxy and different kinds of adventures this is one show you dont want to miss unlock the gate and step through you wont regret it,positive,1
ive seen my fair share of badly thoughtout endings and final twists to films but i dont recall any film that committed outright suicide like this one did  the film makers were clearly hoping that the great twist would surprise us all and it did but perhaps not in the way the directors had hoped i was left feeling surprised that connery harris fishburn and capshaw had anything to do with this turkey individually or collectively  the film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and i like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall but once the twist was revealed the plot holes and inconsistencies were remarkable the underlying motive for revenge was illconceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for bobby earl was ridiculously farfetched whats worse is that once the twist was revealed the remainder of the film became excruciatingly predictable  harris gave a terrific performance and connery is like morgan freeman in that he never gives a bad performance even if the movie aint that great so all in all it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested the last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of cinema,negative,0
  this is the best mock documentary of a dog show that i have seen in a long time a very long time well lets face itever isnt that part of the charm  the idea of actually going to the trouble to make a movie mocking a documentary about an event that most people would find odd in the first place even if there were no big laughs one would still be smirking at the thought any movie that attempts something new scores highly in my proverbial book i loved the dogs too ,positive,1
short version seed isnt worthless its just derivative and inferior and soulless  long version if you have never seen any of the films comprising the vaguelydefined psychological horror genre this movie will probably melt your face off maybe not but it will give you a good burn the opening montage of real animal abuse will be sufficient to open your eyes to possibilities of brutalityonvideo and the only memorable gore scene later in the film will perhaps be more than you can handle the climax will play with your emotions in a way that perhaps no other film has  but thats if you dont have much experience with the genre if youve seen the real thingaugust undergrounds penance for example you will as i did find it terribly difficult to stay awake until the end of the film  other reviewers have compared this to the video nasties of old i understand this comparison like the video nasties seed is more violent than a mainstream horror film and less subtle but the reason the video nasties are still known to us is not only for the above reasonsthose that are still popular had something special permit me to be ambiguous i think you will understand those that have stuck around had soul  take this quote from gabriele crisanti director of burial ground on an interview on the newish dvd we will never have more films like these because today technology has surpassed imagination and technology is cold so many things will disappear because small films like these wont be produced anymore today we have great exceptional tricks that are very expensive but they are cold today a horror a terror film of this kind costs more than a million dollars these films were not so expensivethey are real effects made with our hands  perhaps it is wrong to take the comparison to old school horror so seriously but crisanti has hit the nail on the head even at their most seemingly exploitational the best of the video nasties were pursuing a primitive truth and this is where boll falls short its like hes seen the movies and not understood them everything on the checklist is therebs about making a statement about humanity an obscene torture scene etc but it is as crisanti puts it cold the gore is all cgi the whole thing feels like scenes pieced together from other movies of various genres and the pacing is sooooo slow man so slow  another interesting note the one gore scene really reminded me of a video game  anyway enough bs weak movie,negative,0
this movie is a fascinating example of luis bunuels storytelling abilities this is a comedy that is not a comedy and a social drama that is not a social drama even though i dont think it was particularly funny it made me laugh also despite the fact that you can never take bunuel too seriously the movie made think about religion and its importance in some peoples lives bunuel tells the story of a catholic priest devoted to his faith like no one else and the viewer witness what happens when the priests undying commitment to serve others is put to test as usual bunuels target is catholicism but i dont think he tried to mock the church as he often does at least i didnt take the film as a mockery of the institution i think he is trying to make an interesting point about how religion could be a nuisance in todays modern society not because faith in itself is bad but because people always mange to bastardize the concept message aside i think this is one of bunuels most clever works francisco rabal is superb as the priest definitely one of the filmmakers best movies,positive,1
the only reason i am bothering to comment on this movie is to save you all 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money  i bought it exrental for £300 it looked interesting so i took a chance  within minutes of turning it on i realised id made a mistake the entire cast should be stored away until winter and then thrown on the nearest log fire where they could meet more of their kind  as for the devin hamilton writer and director he should just be shot sadly this should have been done before he made this rubbish  avoid this film if you see it in the shops run away  110,negative,0
made one year before ilsa shewolf of the ss blacksnake could have easily been called susan shewolf of the plantation and it probably inspired the producers behind the nazi sexploitation epics to go ahead with their more infamous films because the stories are identical a gorgeous horny head strong but stupid blonde woman degrades and kills many people under her control whom all hate her and want her dead sounds familiar director russ meyer and david friedman the producer behind the ilsa flicks are good friends and they started their careers together so obviously theres a connection there looking at blacksnake i cant help but think that russ meyer wanted to move on and do something else than his typical busty women epics because xxx movies were all the rage during the mid 1970s and russ meyer films though filled with nudity and kinkiness and violence were never even close to real porn his films started to look positively quaint next to deep throat and other hardcore porno blockbusters meyer knew he couldnt compete with such films and blacksnake is sorta the end result of such a quandary in his career he obviously wanted to branch out into different uncharted territory but blacksnake bombed at the bo and meyer quickly returned to making vixen type of films that even if they still werent pornographic they were most definitely more overthetop than any of his previous films  its no wonder blacksnake was a bo failure its just terrible trashorama jawdroppingly bad its a quasicampy take on slavery if you can imagine that the end result is jarring one minute were in typical meyer territory exuberant playful and silly and then the next minute super serious meditation on slavery and violence huh it just doesnt work the slaveryracism aspect is woefully mishandled and veers this movie in the true exploitation category but blacksnake is not as sleazy as ilsa she wolf of the ss and those kind of films so i imagine fans of the latter were disappointed by it which would explain the almost lack of interest in this movie from either exploitation fans or russ meyer fans meyer blames the failure of blacksnake because and i quote it didnt have enough breasts in it well im sorry russ but the film is just bad breast or no breasts but hes right though about the low breast quota except for anouska and the maid the films cast is male meyer replaces his usual bevy of buxom babes with throng of hunks with massive pecs in the form of anonymous black actors playing the slaves and the big david darth vader prowse and with anouskas right hand man around who is portrayed as a ruthless but clever gay man who enjoys the power he has over the men one can only wonder what meyer was really trying to create here  blacksnake stars david warbeck who is lusted after by anouska and her right hand man poor david he looks totally befuddled by the whole experience he did seem to have fun making the movie but you can clearly see that at times he has no idea whats going on and then theres anouska hempel shes a beautiful womanfor the 1970s not the 1870s with her makeup and hair she looks like a typical 1970s brit pinup babe than a turn of the century dominatrix and her wardrobe is hilarious at one time she actually unzips her leather boots i didnt know they had zippers in those days but the character she plays is in itself really degrading no pun intended shes nothing but a cipher to the object of lust and scorn of every men and that woman on the island for example one night when david and anouska are getting it on her annoying slave driver walks in the room knocks david unconscious and tries to rape her groping her savagely the next day the slave driver is still working for anouska and the two act as if nothing had happened its totally ludicrous under any circumstance had her character been a real person anouska would have whipped the slave driver senseless and kicked his butt off the island or even killed him but the fact that the woman keeps him on her plantation after he tried to rape her is stretching the flimsy story and characters credulity to the max  ridiculous details like this and the thoroughly startling blaxploitation angle makes blacksnake a strangely unpleasant but watchable movie watchable in the train wreck variety i just couldnt help but watch the film for the utter baseless aspects of it all the excellent cinematography sorta makes it easier to watch so this being an exploitation film i guess it succeeded in doing what it was supposed to do but blacksnake is mainly for russ meyer completists,negative,0

hilarious show with so many great stories that it reflects the world today as we know it in such a funny way it literally stole my laughters for other shows i laughed so hard that i just found any other comedy shows unfunny the unique confessions of each characters is a great original technique that just makes the show funny and very humorous you may think that this is an average comedy show about hard life with a family thats what i thought at first but i found out that it holds new and unique techniques that completely sets it apart from any other average comedy show michael rapaport is a star i sure wish that this show wasnt canceled,positive,1
i was a little to old for this show i was 6 when it first came out first off when i was a young child there were a few childrens shows that were on sesame street which i did watch and learned from but other than that there wasnt much else my cousins were all born a few years after me 7 years was the first one more came latter barney was a very big part of what they watched when i first saw this show i told my grandmother how it doesnt teach anything just uses magic to fix everything i was 9 at the time how many 9 years old have any idea what is really going on with a tv show more and more that i saw or heard what the teachings of barney were the more and more i told people how bad the show was the funny thing is my parents who had a young child in the mid to late 80s which was me by the way they agreed and said the same thing as i did the sad thing about this is my cousins who are older now 13 and such still agree with what they saw its not cheating its creative its not right to think differently than what someone tells you to its ok to steal if the person wont find out or mind that it is gone lets be honest with ourselves barney is out to make money not teach children anything the more flashy the program the more inclined children will be to watching it children are stupid not because they are not educated they just do not know any better second barney put on a show and parents bought it i never believed that tv could affect people the way barney does if you have a young child read to them watch a show that teaches them numbers do not let them get involved in this show barney is like smoking once is to much smoke a few and your hooked let your kid watch this show they are hooked and one day their kids will watch the same crap and buy the same crap you bought,negative,0

this is a road movie at least the movie is in yellow anf i think that suggests a road movie  i cant say much positive about the delivery its bad acting certainly their english camera looks like it is done by a kid theres a bomb with counter and suddenly a beetle is falling from the sky since it was so cliche we actually laught the whole time  and that was the most fun of the movie this movie should be released in america but im not sure you should go because that might suggest that is the quality we produce the explosions look boring basically everything is over the top everything is just too much the yellow quality the sound the babe etc find all the cliche part in other movies put them together and you have the delivery,negative,0
rigoletto is verdis masterpiece full of drama emotion and powerful memorable music the maestro must have rolled in his grave when this bawdy travesty of his work was released with its needless frontal nudity and cheap copulating and its portrayal of the naive but principalled gilda as a horny ditz opera certainly can be adapted to cinema  look at zeferellis magnificent la traviata  but when a work is as superb as rigoletto it doesnt need cheap gimmicks it might even have been acceptable if the dubbed in music had been good but it is a mediocre rendering of the libretto with second rate sound quality at that,negative,0
i am surprised that this well above average 80s comedy scores only a 52 from all the imdb voters dan ackroyd does his usual satirical turn as a con who seizes a great opportunity to steal a contract from his prisons physician he retreats to california to start his work giving advice on a radio show pretending to be the infamous dr lawrence baird the only person that knows hes an imposter is the drunken priest walter matthau who comes along to be pampered by ackroyds new found wealth having blakmailed him charles grodin throws in a good supporting performance too for its genre i think this film deserves the same crediblity as ferris bueller or trading places 75  10,positive,1
i first saw ice age in the subiaco cinemas when it came out back in 02 i was only 13 at the time but even then i liked it it had some sort of warmth  weve had it on video for a number of years now and no matter how many times you watch it it never gets boring this is because of the one element which makes it different from all of the other 3d animations made at the time  the characters have no particular home which they leave they are nomads and thats really refreshing and uplifting to watch  also each individual character on the surface appear to be just putting up with each other but theyre really all good friends as well all of the characters have their own charms even the bad guys sid the sloth is charming in his annoying overaffectionate and naive sort of way manny is adorable in his depressed reclusive character and so on and so forth  another great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation all the environments and characters were modeled originally by clay giving the film an artistic edge  another aspect that adds to the feel of the movie is that gender means very little there are hardly any female characters but you dont really realize that until after you watch it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film due to this theres also no mention of a nuclear family which would really be pathetic in a setting like the ice age  all in all ice age is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into 3d animations before shrek 2 and the incredibles came out,positive,1
i had pleasure to watch the short film the cure by first time director ryan jafri what really impress me are the camera work and music  i think many young filmmakers as i myself am one of them would experience hard time with cinematography when just start making of an indie we see the output are not exactly what we imaged or below our ambitions but this film directorial debut from a young director handled very well on screen the camera motion color lighting compositing all contribute to the story and emotion of the film  and music as a key element of film language helps a great deal too  its hard to portray a womans heart her desire her fear especially in a short but still i have to admit i am not a fan of vo narration especially when the film is advanced by narration instead of shots and cuts my personal feeling to some of the narrative part is my guess was the narrator tried a bit too hard so the energy pushes audience back from the emotion of the film  overall its a short film nicely done i could see the input from a director way to go ryan greeting from china looking forward to your next  tim,positive,1
this was one of the most contrived tedious and clichéd films i have ever seen and yes ive seen pearl harbour even the likes of gina mckee couldnt act their way out of the appalling dialogue it has been described as arthouse this can only be a euphemism for dull dreadful and quite frankly artless why is it that when a film is devoid of plot critics feel it deserves to be called art but far more baffling why did america love it without you this film would have remained on the shelf where perhaps it belonged,negative,0
this infamous ending to koen wauters career came to my attention through the night of bad taste judging by the comment index i wasnt the first and i am not to be the last person in western europe to learn that this musician undoubtedly one of the best on our contemporary pop scene even the dutch agree on that tried to be an actor whether he should have made the attempt or not cannot be judged   in intensive care hes quite likable but he seems to be uncomfortable with the flick in which he is participating no one can blame him it deserves its ranking in verheyens hall of fame by all means  standards the story of the murderous maniac who is supposed to have died in an accident but is alive and wrathful has been told dozens of times before and even without original twists a director can deliver a more than mediocre story through innovative settings and cinematography   ic contents itself with a hospital wing and a couple of middle class houses the pace is dull the tension looses the last bit of its credibility to the musical score for every appearance of the murderer is accompagnied by a tedious menacing melody followed by orchestral outbursts during the murders which or largely suggested and in any case as bloodless as a small budget can make them the sex scene is gratuitous but not in the least appealing the couple from amsterdamned could have made it work though while dealing with the couple subject  the whole subplot between wauters and the girl does not work a more effective emotional connection could have been established on screen if they had just been fellow victimstobe who loosen their nerves halfway through physical intercourse i will not even grant the other cast members the dignity of a mentioning for they should all have been chopped up into tiny greasy pieces as a matter of fact most of them do the ones i recall where obvious for the genre  a pretty nurse and two cops   hence in a slasher the cavalry only comes in time to need rescue itself the anti hero has to take out the villain mostly through clever thinking for former red berets dont often get parts in these films they might overcome the illusion of invincibility that surrounds the killer translated to the events wauters kills the doctor and saves the dame in distress   no people i am not finished this is not how the story goes wauters makes his heroic attempt but gets beaten up with a fury that comes close to a clockwork orange so it is up to the girl to pick up the driller killer act and pierce through the doctors brains though this method ensures the killers death more than the usual rounds of 9mm bullets the doctor survives in order to enable ic to reach the 80 min mark  i should have made my point by now intensive care is a bad movie which can only be enjoyed by bad taste lovers who can verify verheyens catchy statements and make some up for themselves and that way try to sit through it for example the unintended parody value of the doctors clown mask halloween and the final confrontation in the park the chase at the end of friday the 13th  however let me conclude by giving an overview by a few measly elements which give ic a little credit george kennedy is not one of them all he has to do is endure a horrible monologue by a fellow doctorfrench actor and look horrified when they let him go down in flames in order to tag his big name on a standin he could have played his naked gun part again to end up as beef but with a longer screen time the finale may be one of them i had never seen a maniac being brought down by launching fireworks into his guts in order to crush him against a flexible fence it is good for a laugh  name one good truly point about intensive care  koen wauters learned his lesson and devoted himself entirely to his musical career it makes me wonder how many editions of the parisdakar race he has to abort before coming to his senses  ,negative,0
ive been strangely attracted to this film since i saw it on showtime sometime in the early 80s i say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of softcore fluff a genre im not particularly interested in the dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical making sense no doubt only to its francoitalian producersand the plot completely extraneous what it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood the scenery the beautiful philippines softfocus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today it is truly one of my great guilty pleasures i was fortunate enough to find it on an old laserdisc and have watched it more times than i think is healthy a worthwhile moodpiece,positive,1
i was watching the beginning of this on a friday midday while working at computer at home relaxing a bit after a hectic week and cleaningup some files and answering some communications got interrupted a couple of times so had trouble getting all the details straight although its hardly a work of hitchcock proportions where missing a detail can through the whole story offkilter and besides it was not exactly an engrossing piece of work  so during a commercial read the only prior comment here by mgconlan1 and pretty much can agree with its details  not quite in the category of a film so awful it is fascinatingly good but id like to catch on tape when run again rather than seeing it as aired so i can fast forward as needed and see the parts which i missed this first time  give it a 3 because of the attractiveness of the four primary characters,negative,0
1980 was certainly a year for bad backwoods slasher movies friday the 13th and the burning may have been the best ones but there were like always a couple of stinkers not far behind like dont go into the woods alone and this one but in all fairness the prey is nowhere near as bad as dont go into the woods but its still not great either one thing is that its just boring and acting isnt very good but much better than dgitw and this movie actually has some attractive looking females to look at all three of the female leads were stunning one thing what is up with all that pointless wildlife footage it just seemed pointless and it looked as the director used that to just used that to fill up some time space  so what was there to like about this movie well there were a few laugh out loud cheese moments i couldnt contain a fit of giggles when the final girl did a bizarre type of backwards moonwalk to get away from the kille and there were a few good kill scenes my favourites being the girl suffocated to death with the sleeping bag and the phoney looking  all in all the prey is dumb boring and the killer i didnt find scary at all this movie could have been a whole lot better,negative,0
i have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favoritesit has all the charm 1940s quaintness and good old fashioned romance and its hilarious to boot barbara stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes cookinghome life articles for a famous magazineunder the premise that she is a married homemaker even the president of the magazine is under this delusion enter a handsome gi played by the talented dennis morganjust rescued off of a raft along with his buddy his simple wish is to stay at the homey inn the she writes so eloquently about and relax with her famous homecooked meals she now has to frantically find a way to save her job and reputationadd to this that her fiancé is in a hurry to tie the knot doesnt help the humor is superb and the chemistry between the leading characters a lot of fun throw in the characteractor nicknamed cuddles who fits this name completely it becomes even more adorable this has become my mustsee movie that i snuggle in with a cup of cocoa each christmas season a wonderful enjoyable movie to enjoy at christmastime or anytime,positive,1
john boormans 1998 the general was hailed as a major comeback though its hard to see why on the evidence of the film itself one of three films made that year about famed northern irish criminal martin cahill alongside ordinary decent criminal and vicious circles it has an abundance of incident and style the film was shot in colour but released in bw scope in some territories but makes absolutely no impact and just goes on forever with a main character who threatens witnesses car bombs doctors causes a hundred people to lose their jobs tries to buy off the sexually abused daughter of one of his gang to keep out of jail and nails one of his own to a snooker table yet still remains a popular local legend an attractive enough personality for his wife to not only approve but actually suggest a ménage a trios with her sister it needs a charismatic central performance to sell the character and the film it doesnt get it instead its lumbered with what may well be brendan gleesons worst and most disinterested performance he delivers his lines and stands in the right place but theres nothing to suggest either a local hero or the inner workings of a complex character on the plus side this helps not to overglamorize a character who is nothing more than an egotistical thug but its at odds with a script that seems to be expecting us to love him and his antics  theres a minor section that picks up interest when the ira whips up a local hate campaign against the general and his men painting them as antisocial drug dealers purely because cahill wont share his loot from a robbery with them but its temporary resolution is so vaguely shot  something to do with cahill donning a balaclava and joining the protesters which were expected to find lovably cheeky  that its just thrown away things are more successful in the last third as the pressure mounts and his army falls apart but by then its too late to really care adrian dunbar maria doyle kennedy and the gorgeous angeline ball do good work in adoring supporting roles but jon voights hammy garda beat cop seems to be there more for american sales than moral balance overcompensating for gleesons comatose noninvolvement in what feels like a total misfire come back zardoz all is forgiven,negative,0
a scientist and his girl friend are out driving when his speeding causes a car crash he escapes unharmed but she is decapitated he saves her head brings it to his house and keeps it alive  he then proceeds to search out models and strippers for the perfect body for the head his crippled assistant watches over the head which starts talking and has a telepathic or telepathetic link to a deformed monster kept in the closet  as you can see this is pretty stupid stuff but i had a certain fondness for it when i grew up in the late 1970s a local tv station showed this movie about 20 times each year no exaggeration they showed it always on saturday afternoon tvuncut seeing this on tv back then was great explicit blood and gore along with a gruesome monster and sleazy sexploitationwho cares if it was good seeing it now i realize how lousy this really is  the acting is perfectly wretched the production values are nonexistent the script is pretty dumb and aside from the still pretty disgusting gore this is dull stuff theres also a mild cat fight between two women and the admittedly great monster at the end also add in an ending which leaves tons of loose ends on one hand this is an interesting example of a 1960s exploitation film on the other its utter trash either way its not a good movie but is a mustsee for one time only for horror and gore fans  also the heads laugh is pretty creepy note the end credits which gets the title wrong calling it the head that wouldnt die,negative,0
the title of this movie doesnt make a lot of sense until you see it in operation because its the sound that a retarded young man makes while hes operating his imaginary trolley which is what he does all day and he is just one of many odd characters in this surreal  at times tragic tale of a group of slumdwellers in japan  there are two drunks who trade wives theres a man with aspirations to be a architect and his young son who he sends out to beg for food theres a wise old man who seems to be the pillar of sanity within all that goes on around him and theres a businessman with some severe nervous tics that has a wife that treats him and everyone else like dirt  theres no particular plot to this really its a bunch of stories that drift back  forth between each other sometimes funny sometimes tragic all in all i thought it worked pretty well  i had been dying to see this for a long time just based on its description i was not in the least disappointed and id definitely recommend this 9 out of 10,positive,1
i totally disagree with the person who first commented about this movie to me this storyline is about a man with growth hormonal disorder trying his best to look for the love he is yearning for trying his very best to fit into the society who doesnt seemed to accept him  he then met someone who treats him with best friends love and was shown the way to receiving the love he always wanted to have the man who created all that happiness in returned received something important from the giant which is family and spouse love  and the comedy its just part of making the audience feel some laughter bugs at certain part of the shows  and i must admit it made me tear a little,positive,1
this film is about a woman falling in love with a friend of her boyfriend from then on she has to divide her time for the two boyfriends jack during the day and joseph during the night  this film feels like as if it was made with minimum budget the majority of the film is set in a flat with minimal furniture there are only three main actors all the other actors listed in the credits make only momentary appearances the wardrobe designer doesnt seem to have much to do as the actors wear very down to earth clothes and actually most of the time they are naked anyway  the film is very dialog heavy which should have made up for the shortcomings described above however the dialogs sound too composed and awkward in the beginning of the film most of the dialog is a person saying a very long sentence and then the person says me too after the frenzy of agreement the dialog descends into a mess of disjointed and confused word salad  the only merit of this film i can think of is that it serves as a feminist outlet which conveys that it is not just men who can be unfaithful  this film is a great disappointment,negative,0

the priyadarshanparesh rawal combo has been golden before with the likes of hera pheri and hungama so i went into the movie at an indian multiplex with high hopes especially after the slick promos unfortunately like hulchul before it this movie was a huge disappointment  like others have commented the premise of the movie which was already stale to begin with just gets stretched on and on without any development or additional layering after a while you just want the movie to end so you can go home if i had been watching this at home it would have been much easier to cut my losses akshay kumars performance is average at best and john abraham should not try doing comedy again the comedy aspects of the movie overall were pretty week i only remember giggling like twice the entire movie definitely no sidesplitting belly laughs that consumed me in hera pheri or even to a lesser extent in awara paagal deewana paresh rawal had a few of his expected classic moments but overall because his role and character wasnt given much room to grow he didnt make much of an impact in this film  neha dhupia who makes only an appearance in the movie was fun to look at while she was on screen and some of the songs are fun especially the opening and closing songs of ada and kiss me baby respectively otherwise youre better off just passing on this movie,negative,0
there is good there is bad and then their is the sentinel a bottombarrel political thriller that ranks among the worst movies i have ever seen the plot of a mole in the secret service is a good one but never has a movie with so much potential been so utterly butchered directed with hamhanded edginess by clark johnson every actor in this film seems to be working on autopilot even the great michael douglas looks bored here i can honestly say i have never in all my life viewed another film with so many glaring plot holes the twist is predictable from square one and the characters motives are so utterly ridiculous that they inspired laughter from the audience avoid this at all costs this is a catastrophe of a movie with no redeeming value,negative,0
from the awful death scenes to guns that fire without making sounds to a character called the fiend its all tiresome slow moving unimaginative drivel it was ok seeing the guy with the cape and the hunchback lurking around visually it was creepy and probably occupied the moviegoer of the time but even in 1936 one would think that there would have been a little more imagination and verisimilitude to even a film like this i just kept waiting for something to happen of any importance as people stood around making speeches and acting like they were posing at an office picnic and then there are those bullets as a previous commentator mentioned perhaps the best clue would have been to search for a water spot on someones pants pocket,negative,0
except for the brady variety hour this was some of the hokiest television ive seen in a while the video production qualities werent too bad but the overall look and feel were unmistakeably early 80s and marie osmond looks like she did battle with the avon lady and lost big time way too much eyeliner  it was kind of embarrassing to watch veterans danny kaye and eric severeid take part in this even more interesting was watching alex haley talk about the african pavillion in world showcase that would be opening in about a year  as of this writing it is 17 years later and it hasnt opened yet unless you count disneys animal kingdom all in all though for all the shortcomings this still an interesting visual piece of disney history,negative,0
there is a dvd published in the uk in 2002 code hrgd002 on the cover no asin vfc 19796 on the disk no ifpi code in the inner rim  probably a straight transfer from vhs   there is no much point is commenting an adult film but this one contains a minimal plot and the characters are believable it was shown in the united states in normal cinemas  ive seen it in pensylvannia way back in 1975  as such it deserves a place in an encyclopedia of movies the dvd has no special features and no subtitles and was probably made using a vhs tape as source,negative,0

a remake can be successful an adaptation can be successful it isnt relevant whether its a remake or an adaptation  a good movie is a good movie and a poor movie is a poor movie regardless  sarkar i am afraid was a very poor movie first of all just by making characters look dangerous or macho they dont bring in an aura about them  what was so brilliant about nagreamitabh bacchans character that we should have been in aura of his power and what showed the benevolence of the character nothing  this fact was said by a commentator and amitabh kept giving facial expressions now amitabh can give brilliant facial expressions but why should it mean any thing if there is no history or story to go with it  there wasnt proper charecterisation of the characters who worked under sarkar too just because a man had spectacles why should we assume he is wise  the flow of the movie was generally dullbecause scenes from the godfather were created like the policeman slapping abhishek bacchan the older brother being killed by abhishek like fredo was killed on instructions of pacino but too much was sought to be packed into the movie with too little story and depth to go with it that was indeed the problem  if you try to pack 3 hours of intricate detail like a godfather in 2 hours and that too with few dialogues what you get is a highlights show from a cricket match never making the full impact watching a full match will make,negative,0
rich in love is a sliceoflife film which takes the viewer into the goings on of a somewhat quirky charleston sc family highly romanticized beautifully shot well written and acted ril washes over you like a summer breeze as its plotless meandering breathes life into the characters such that at films end youll feel like an old friend of the family  a wonderfully crafted characterdriven film from the director of driving miss daisy ril is a somewhat obscure little sleeper which will appeal most to mature audiences,positive,1
how can barry levinson possibly assemble whitehot comedy talents ben stiller and jack black the gorgeous rachel weisz old pro christopher walken and still deliver such a humourless stinker  stiller and black are friends until the latter invents a spray to make dog mess vanish and becomes a conspicuous consuming multimillionaire  the premises is thin but sound enough in the right hands to have been a springboard for some great bitching between the two stars but all concerned overplay every hand every chance they can  stiller and black are simply not funny for way too much of the time weisz looks sensational as always but is criminally underused and with the exception of walken as a batty barfly who urges stillers character to take revenge its a turgid trudge to the end of this strained farce,negative,0
the 1986 tv movie of the spirit was a pilot for a possible series however spirit creator will eisner did not like the film and thus no series was produced i thought it was a very entertaining film and captured the spirit sorry of the comic with a modern twist im sorry it didnt materialize into a series sam flash gordon jones was a perfect spirit nana visitor was a nice ellen dolan and of course would later go on to star trekdeep space nine years later maybe with the release of frank millers bigscreen version of the spirit more people will be able to see this rare gem of spirit history it seems that when hollywood makes a film from an already established character or idea someone will inevitably seek out previous versions of the property and release it to video in order to make a few dollars when antonio banderas donned the mask of zorro we were able to get earlier versions of the masked hero on dvd such as the great alain delon version of the 1970s although all copies i ever saw were badly edited heres hoping someone will release the tv adventure of the spirit to dvd soon,positive,1
so often a band will get together for a reunion concert only to find that they just cant get it together not so here this concert is just shear brilliance from start to finish these three musicians obviously got together beforehand and plotted and planned what was needed to ensure this was not just a nostalgic bash to satisfy someones ego this is obvious from the start before they even step on stage many faces in the crowd werent even born when these guys first performed from the first song they capture that old magic that was cream 3 men 3 instruments no fuss clapton by his own admission said he had to stretch himself for this concert because there were no keyboards synthesizers etc so we get to see him at his best ginger baker demonstrates why so many drummers today speak of him as some sort of drumming guru jack bruce just great they really managed to put together a piece of magic that will stand the test of time for many years to come this ones a 10 for me,positive,1
alexander nevsky 1938 is a brilliant piece of cinematic propaganda the people of russia are threatened by two major enemies the mongols and the teutonic knights of the holy roman empire in ordered to unite the warring rival princes in the russian realm nevsky takes charge and fights the lesser of two evils the teutonics this influential film was copied many times over and it still holds up to this day the soundtrack by composer prokiev and eisentsteins direction are a sight and sound to behold many years later john milius used many of the movies scenes set pieces and costumes from this film and incorporated them into conan  one of my favorite lines from conan was taken from this movie its not the strength of the iron in a weapon but the strength of the person that wields it is what matters the comparisons are unmistakable the armor that james earl jones and the leader of the teutonic knights wear are virtually identical a true tribute paid from one director to another  i give alexander nevsky one of my highest recommendations the movie plays like the final act of richard iii the presence of prince alexander on the screen is truly amazing,positive,1

the thumb idea isnt such a winner the second time round thumbtanic wasnt as good as thumb wars for a number of reasons primarily i think mr oedekerk had far less to work with in the titanic sendup unlike star wars the movie titanic hasnt yet become a cultural myth and there are far fewer references to be made which will resonate with the audience  in thumbtanic the holes are filled by oneoff jokes which dont really seem related to anything for example the heros insinuation that the heroine isnt clean during the jump off end of ship scene  its not funny rather you just think to yourself did i miss something in the original movie there were too many of these type of baseless jokes cf arachnid  by contrast the sendup of the smarmy ships designer had meaning and was funny also very funny was the send up of the bloke in the movie who wanted to go faster as a maniac running around demanding everything be faster including the sinking of the ship and himself being the first to die these sort of jokes meant something in the titanic context and lent meaningful humour to thumbtanic  the thumb media the faces and the voices are still amusing the props and sets and the cg animation are worthy of appreciation overall although thumbtanic proves that quirkiness alone wont work this filmette still keeps you amused and chuckling to the end,negative,0
my comments may be a bit of a spoiler for what its worth stop now if you care enough  saving grace should have been titled a paperthin excuse for old british women to get high onscreen this film is dumb the incidental music is an annoyance as are the obvious hackneyed tunes that sporadically pop up to comment on the narrative spirit in the sky for example  oh i get it this is basically a cheech and chong movie made credible by its stodgy english setting and brenda blethyns overwhelming power to inflict emotion on an audience using her voice alone i could literally hear the folks over at high times magazine receiving their jollies over the enormous buds that litter this picture worst scene easy brenda attempts to peddle her illicit wares on the street of london in a blaring white dresssuit not funny not original not interesting not a good movie the 72 rating is the result of zealots overvoting dont waste your time,negative,0
i honestly had somewhat high expectations when i first began to watch this movie but it turned out to be probably one of the most boring films i have ever seen  first of all the pace is incredibly slow so it seems much longer than it is and its not shortim sure when jane austen wrote the book she made it several pages long filled it with description and didnt intend for people to read in in one day or it might drag and lose its appeal which emma most certainly did now sense and sensibility had this flaw of a slow pace but at least it had lively lines to make up for it as well as some good performances  that brings me to flaw 2 which is of course the acting while i dont happen to care for basically anybody involved in this film i am sure they are capable of good work but i didnt see much of it in this movie it was like people were trying too hard to be witty too hard to be upperclass too hard to be british well some of them so they all just came off as a bunch of actors and not as people  3 the cast as i said seemed only like actors and not actually like the people they were playing maybe thats a good thing because the people they played really werent all that nice why did everybody like emma for example sure she was nice to the rich handsome people in front of them but she was an awful gossip behind their backs if her friends were ugly then she didnt even bother to go behind their backs so why is this girl so great why do people have to tell stories just to make her laugh of course the snob couldnt even do that right i have enough problems with gwyneth paltrow as gwyneth paltrow and her emma did not exactly change my opinion  well its easy to see that i did not care for this one im sure its a lovely book and all but some books are really not meant to be made for the big screen and emma is one of them,negative,0
the story idea behind the lost missile isnt bad at all but unfortunately the story does get a bit dull towards the middle and the overuse of stock footage as well as poor special effects sink this film to the subpar level  the film begins with a missile heading towards the earth in a panic because its about to strike the earth the soviets manage to deflect the object this isnt necessarily good however as this seemingly unmanned craft has a vapor trail that destroys everything in its path and the ship is now in a low orbit over the planet in other words with each pass it makes a swath of death followsone that could potentially kill us all so its up to the good scientists of the us led by a very young and hardly recognizable robert loggia to formulate and plan to save usand especially save new york that is in its immediate flight path unfortunately they arent able to save ottawa ive never been there so i cant say whether or not this is a big loss but thanks to good old american knowhow they are able to eventually destroy this harbinger of destruction   so as you can see the story idea isnt bad and rather original but so many old clips of fighter planes and guys manning radar scopes gets a bit old and it seemed like padding overall a decent but hardly inspired film that extreme fans of the genre may likeall others see it at your own risk,negative,0
this tv show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on tv today horribly predictable obscene usage of slow motion photography cheesy story lines chuck norris is an abomination who should never have been allowed to be filmed in anything the way he chooses to make each episode into a public service announcement is really annoying his acting sucks so bad that it makes a person cringe with embarrassment i will give the series some credit thoughit does get entertaining at times but not enough for it make any difference with all the negative points this series has i still prefer it over reality tv it cant really get any more worthless than that,negative,0
ronald colman plays a famous broadway actor who has begun to lose his mind and sense of identity after years of playing a wide range of parts he cant remember who he exactly iswho are his roles and who is the self and much more serious he begins to see and hear his play even in regular everyday life so since hes currently playing in othello he begins to act jealous and suspiciousjust like the title character ultimately it leads him to the depths of insanity and murder  i saw this film years ago and liked it i just saw it again and loved it now perhaps some of my enthusiasm is because i have always liked ronald colman and this is a great triumph for himand for which he earned the best actor oscar and looking at the competition that year gregory peck for gentlemans agreement john garfield for body and soul william powell for life with father and michael redgrave for mourning becomes electra i think colman was a very good choice as he stretched from his usual comfort zone and did a much more demanding role  now i noticed that one reviewer hated this film because they hated shakespeareand this took up about half their review talking about their dislike for him however this film isnt really about shakespeare and it doesnt matter at all if you dislike shakespeare i am no huge fan of shakespeare but marveled at the small portions of the play that colman reenactedthough as i said this is not a really movie about shakespeare instead its a wonderful portrait of an actor losing his mind and mixing his stage role with reality it could have been any play though othello was an excellent choice because of the murder scenewhich gets acted out for real later in the film  overall a very clever film due to a lovely scriptwith some overtones of film noir fortunately the acting was terrific also as colman had excellent support from signe hasso shelly winters and edmond obrien who was particularly goodhe played his part just right and considering the great george cukor was directing its no wonder its a wonderful film from start to finish,positive,1

ok so this film is well acted it has good direction but the simple fact is that it undermines what all gay and lesbian people have been fighting for all these years the straight man deciding to be gay and the gay man deciding to be straight i did enjoy it up until the last 20 minutes after that i got really offended as what usually happens in these films the straight actors play the main parts and the out gay actors play the secondary straight roles the leads are played by handsome men but dont let that distract you from the fact that this is a a film that leaves you feeling unfulfilled all the romance and relationships you hope would happen do not unless you are a priest that is in which case god bless straight woman who cure our homos,negative,0

alfred hitchcocks saboteur is not one of his bestregarded films made between two vastly more popular and critically praised pictures suspicion and shadow of a doubt its generally regarded as a lesser effort i agree that the later film is groundbreaking drawing hitchcock wholly into the american mainstream for the first time but saboteur is in its way at least as lively as suspicion its chief flaw being its less than charismatic star players bob cummings and priscilla lane  in saboteur we find hitchcock feeling his way around america literally as its lead character travels from california to new york in search of an arsonist for whose crime he was accused cummings is very youthful here and quite engaging his boyishness but not immaturity perfectly suits the character he is portraying and seems appropriate as the director though middleaged was in the process of reinventing himself and an older more established star might have thrown things off priscilla lanes spunky heroine which not a typical type for the director was very much a common type in american films at the time and she and cummings provide an openness and a youth the director needed both in his life and work at this time i cannot imagine older more solid typescooper and stanwyck for instancedoing any better as they would have between them carried well too much baggage  as is the norm in hitchcocks films nothing is as it appears where saboteur differs from his better known films is that the audience is let in on the game early though cummings is an accused arsonist we know that he is innocent the villains become apparent fairly soon and the movie hinges more on its plot than its ironies what pleasures there are are incidental and here the master does not disappoint there is an interesting tod browningish interlude with some circus freaks who help cummings elude capture in another scene reminiscent of james whales bride of frankenstein cummings spends some time in the cottage of a blind man who as it turns out is lanes uncle was the director perhaps studying key american films of the previous decade whatever the case these and other offbeat and discursive aspects of the movie give it a playfulness and variety which when one adds the factor of quite youthful leads makes the picture seem like the work of a younger man still learning his craft  the films later scenes in new york are more suspenseful and typical of the director as the picture gradually becomes more hitchockian as it moves along in the end i find it a satisfying work and as neither cummings nor lane has a dark side as an actor neither does the movie have one it is deliberately lightweight and i suspect semiexperimental an attempt by hitchcock to see if he could pull off in an american setting the sort of story he had done so well in england he succeeded admirably the next logical step shadow of a doubt a film in which the main character travels east to west and with a wholly different set of values and plans   ,positive,1

no this is not an ed wood movie angora love is stan laurels and oliver hardys last silent movie the end of an era in the 20s laurel  hardy left a real mark on the silent movie genre with movies that are still popular and being watched and aired regularly this present day  its a shame that this movie is however not among their best  the premise of the movie sounds good and is good the boys team up with a goat this time which of course leads them into trouble and for us some hilarious situations to watch it however at the same time is extremely silly and just totally unbelievable to watch the boys doing comedy stuff with a goat most of the jokes in the movie still work good but the movie just however never gets truly hilarious or memorable the comedy and story really feels lacking at times and is mostly too simple and predictable  of course still good and fun enough to watch for the fans but still a slightly disappointing last silent laurel  hardy entry  710,positive,1
i just saw this movie mainly because brady corbet is in it and i must say that i was not pleased   of course the computer graphics were amazing but the story line needed a little touchup also i think this movie would have done much better with more curses and blood as well if it were rated pg13   that would definitely attract more people to see itteens what would also attract more teens particularly teen girls would be a large close up of brady corbet on the thunderbirds poster   even though the movie had its down points i still saw it and thought it was okay,negative,0
ive seen mystery men cop a bit of stick in the press and with the general public  take the imdb vote for instance but my overall feeling is that mystery men is more fun than most films definitely wittier than most socalled comedy films and very nearly clever  the cast is superb greg kinnear is excellent as are geoffrey rush and tom waits kinnears limo scene with ricky jay is perfect spoiled movie star and he imbues his character with the right balance of comic book quality and realism to make him work  i will admit the pacing is a little off in places and visuals are certainly very flash bang possibly to the detriment of further characterisation but at the end of the day this is high concept film making  its about the little moments whats up tiger lily  and there are so many great ones in this film to make it worth repeated viewing,positive,1

this movie represents the times it was made in as much as the original i suppose which is really sad because at a deeper level the title vanishing point the original is so ironic im sure it wasnt intended that way but the original was filmed in 1970 and released in 1971 the real vanishing point was the end of an era which pretty much ended in the early 1970s   in this remake all the countercultural elements have been stripped away and been rendered more pc in an attempt to reach a broader audience presumably sanitized for your protection   inserting the american indian scenes was gratuitous and the idea of a noble purpose to the trip was subtraction by addition im glad i watched it however it made me appreciate the original that much more the original is a cult classic and golden this remake is dreadful,negative,0
this review is for the extended cut of this movie  i first watched dragon lord when i bought it on dvd many years ago i always liked this movie and you can read some of the more positive reviews of it to get the general idea  that being said ive always found the storyline a bit confusing the movie is after all a love story and it always seemed strange to me that a love story should end with a 20 minute fight scene  well in the extended version this is no longer so the old original version begins off with a huge barrelclimbrugbylike sequence which is the new ending sequence in the extended version the opening sequence is dragonjackie chan hanging around his house and pretending to be training and reciting whenever his father is around  other sequenced have also been shift or prolonged in the extended cut and the story makes a lot more sense when you watch it the pacing is also better and overall it just works better it feels more like a love story and doesnt leave you asking questions about why it ends so drastically and dramatically as the regular version does  i suggest everyone who is a hongkong cinema or just plain jackie chan fanatic to get a hold of the extended version and watch the movie the way it was originally intendedor at least thats how i think it was intended why else would they make it and rearrange some of the scenes when i was done watching it i felt like i had watched a completely new jackie chan movie although most of the sequences were the same,positive,1

like all of the very earliest films this movie is very very shortlasting about one minute so because of its brevity its not really possible to compare it to more modern films but for its time its actually a very remarkable film much of this is because the prints were hand paintedmaking annabelle appear red and other colors as she does her amazing dance ive actually seen two different versionsone where she is red and another where she changes color throughout i think the red one depicted on the dvd the great train robbery and other primary works is the best of them the dance itself is very hypnotic and much like a piece of amazing performance art and unlike other one minute or less films of the day this one is one i could see repeatedlyits just that visually compelling and odd  if you want to see it online there is a 36 second version on google video type in serpentine dance,positive,1
the thing i remember most about this film is that it used to air on local ktla tv ch 5 during every christmas season during the mid to late 70s mainly due to the fact that the true story took place on or near christmas eve it was always a bit disturbing to see the hell that this girl goes through being the lone survivor of a plane crash in the peruvian jungle the graphic scene of this young girl pulling leeches out of her infected leg made quite an impression on this young viewer not quite the kind of christmas cheer i was used to seeing at the time definitely not a rankinbass production,positive,1

francis ford coppola wrote and directed this stunningly personal story of a married womans flight from her husbandand the reality that perhaps the youthful glee and excitement of her younger years are behind her we learn little about this womans marriage except that she has been feeling her independence slipping away as of late shes also recently learned shes pregnant which has further complicated her heart she doesnt want to be a complacent wifey despite the maternal way she speaks to her husband over the phone she meets two men on her journey a former college football hero whoafter an accident during a gamehas been left with permanent brain damage and a sexy strutting motorcycle cop who has a great deal of trouble in his own life the clear clean landscapes as photographed by the very talented wilmer butler are astutely realized as are the characters shirley knight james caan and robert duvall each deliver strong gripping performances most especially since these are not very likable people in conventional terms some scenes such as knights first call home from a payphone or her first night alone with caan where they play simon says are almost too intimate to watch coppola toys with reality turning the jagged memories of his characters into scrapbooks weve been made privy to he allows scenes to play out yet the editing is quite nimble and the film is never allowed to get too heavy there are at least two or three very frisky moments its a heady endeavorso much so that the picture was still being shown at festivals nearly five years later some may shun coppolas unapologetic twisting of events in order to underline the finale with bitter irony however the forcefulness and drive behind the picture nearly obliterate its shortcomings  from ,positive,1
the only thing great about the movie is its title in this case snake on a plane is example of not judging the book by its cover the title says nothing about the movie when i went to the theater i wasnt expecting citizen kane i was expecting independence day a movie thats pure popcorn fun but instead i got that horrible roy liotta movie called  turbulence yes this is how bad soap is the only thing make soap better is its title and its not even the apporiate title for the movie the wasnt even a glimpse of snake or plane 40 minutes into the movie what a false advertising if it wasnt for its title soap would be just another unforgettable cheap bgrade summer movie and the r rating it has to be the most undeserved r rated movie of all time the makers of the movie only add a few f word to make this a r all of the violence are kept pg13 level you know whats really r rated the r rated superstar edge see him at summerslam instead of waste your money on a snake,negative,0
i remember when this film was up for the academy awards and did not win in any category for the life of me i cannot remember what it was up against but one thing i can say it was one of the best movies i have ever seen and the fact that steven spielberg directed the film did not persuade me one bit  essentially it is about a black womans trials and tribulations as she is growing up from a girl to a woman there are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying but all of them are needed to see how much this woman has put up with along the way we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption whoopi goldberg gives her best performance ever in this movie danny glover should have also gotten at least nominated for his role in this film   and the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects humanely not like some sideshow freak shows like the more recent beloved did i encourage anyone of any race to see this film 910,positive,1
i have nothing but praise for this movie and cast especially ann margaret but more importantly i have praise for my inlaws who were are the adoptive parents of warren and frank in real life i met most of the children at warrens wedding in 1989 this is an amazing story and is even more incredible to me knowing the family and what everyone went through it is also enjoyable for me to see how my inlaws were portrayed in the movie it was pretty accurate my wife even enjoys seeing some little details such as a toaster that she remembered from her childhood yes it is a hard movie to watch but so amazing and heartfelt  the beauty of this story for me is how many of the children passed through my inlaws lives and as a result of marrying their daughterand having warren as a brotherinlaw how many i have met in mine for the past 20 years this story has been a part of my life because of what my motherinlaw has shared with me that and knowing warren for what it is worth warren lives in california with his family he married his high school sweetheart who he reconnected with at his 20 year high school reunion  there was a show in the 1980s called thats incredible they had a reunion of the family who also got to meet the cast of the show  for anyones interest the dvd is available in great britain and australia it is a tough video to come by here in the united states and i have not been able to find a dvd here yet,positive,1
vonneguts words are best experienced on paper the tales he weaves are gossemar silken strands of words and expressions that are not easily translated into a world of marilyn manson or jerry bruckheimer explosions his words have been treated well once before in the remarkable slaughterhouse5  mother night is probably one of the three novels vonnegut has written i could take to a desert island along with slaughterhouse5 and bluebeard  the film version deserves a 10 but the books are so permanently part of my interior landscape that i just cant do itsome of the scenes left out of the film are part of my memory,positive,1
this is the last of four swashbucklers from france ive scheduled for viewing during this christmas season the others in order of viewing were the uninspired the black tulip 1964 from the same director as this one but not nearly as good the surprisingly effective lady oscar 1979 which had originated as a japanese manga and the splendid cartouche 1962 actually i had watched this one not too long ago on latenight italian tv and recall not being especially bowled over by it so that i was genuinely surprised by how much i enjoyed it this time around also bearing in mind the baffling lack of enthusiasm shown towards the film here and elsewhere when it was first announced as an upcoming dvd release from criterion  incidentally fanfan la tulipe has quite a bit in common with the aforementioned cartouche not just cast and crew members producers georges dancigers and alexandre mnouchkine cinematographer christian matras actor noel roquevert but plotwise as well  in fact the hero is a womanizing soldier jeanpaul belmondos cartouche had also had a brief military spell whos loved by a fiery girl in this case gypsy gina lollobrigida while hes himself obsessed by an impossible love here its none other than the kings daughter as in the later film too fanfan an ideally cast gerard philipe who ironically is so full of life here that one finds it hard to believe that he would be stricken down by cancer within 7 years time is flanked by two funloving yet cowardly men one of them is actually his superior officer and the heroines own father and opposed by an unscrupulous figure within his own ranks the ageing roquevert with whom the hero eventually engages in a rooftop duel since he too has amorous designs on the gypsy girl for the record lollobrigida will rejoin philippe in her next film rene clairs delightful romantic fantasy les belles de nuit 1952  fanfan proved to be a big boxoffice hit on its homeground and even copped a surprising but welldeserved best direction award at cannes over more renowned films like an american in paris 1951 detective story 1951 othello umberto d and viva zapata in fact its popularity ensured its rerelease in a computercolored version presumably for the benefit of viewers who wouldnt touch a blackandwhite product with a tenfoot pole and the criterion dvd itself contains a sample from this variant being obviously a foreignlanguage title theres also the dubious choice of an englishdubbed soundtrack but even if these proved not especially painful to sit through considering when all is said and done theres simply no substitute for the original   fanfan la tulipe a nickname given the hero by a young genevieve page as the celebrated madame de pompadour contains about as much comedy as the expected action and romance while some may find this overwhelming i dont agree myself as i enjoyed the sharply satirical narration and on the whole this combination is comparable with jerzy skolimowskis equally droll the adventures of gerard 1970 that said the swordfights here are remarkably forceful for an essentially lighthearted enterprise particularly a scuffle in the woods and the ambush at a convent and the film itself rather adult at times with numerous allusions to sexuality as well as coarse language adopted throughout when viewed backtoback with vintage hollywood fare as i did now the climax then is quite ingenious the enemy forces who amusingly are made to speak in speededup gibberish are depleted by our heroic trio alone much to the kings amazement who as portrayed by marcel herrand  bestknown for his role of leader of the parisian underworld in marcel carnes children of paradise 1945  is himself something of a lecher  ps an italian tv channel has been threatening to screen christianjaques promising champagne for savages 1964 for months now but despite programming it three times already with a tentative fourth one slated for next week they have yet to show it even so i do have three more films of his in my unwatched vhs pile equally culled from latenight italian tv screenings the threehour epic la chartreuse de parme 1948 also starring gerard philippe the second twin 1967 and the legend of frenchie king 1971 with brigitte bardot and claudia cardinale,positive,1
very suspenseful surprisingly intelligent film about five medical students flatlining themselves and then being resuscitated to share their experiences of death and what lies beyond joel schumacher directs with some skill  creating some very eerie scenes as well as particularly beautiful ones the visions of death are not what viewers might expect nor is that which awaits us all when we go  thanks to screenwriter peter filardi who really did an outstanding job coming up with this story while the creativity of the story is impressive the story has many holes as well particularly in the logic department and believability factors notwithstanding all of that flatliners is a good effective film because of the script the direction which again is very surreal at times and the acting which brings four very talented actors and william baldwin together this core of actors acts and reacts off each other very nicely keifer sutherland does a very impressive job as the head of the group  the one who comes up with the idea to die and be born again he also manages to portray a man a young man  with a damaging destructive secret from his past kevin bacon is fine as the most pragmatic and skeptical of the group oliver platt is really good as the voice of reason and human fears platt has some really good lines and plays the paranoia well yes julia roberts is here too and very good the actors do best though by playing off each other and making us believe they are such good friends i was duly impressed with much of flatliners but more than anything else the story affected me the most the scene with that dog hobbling around the street just one of those powerful images evoked as were many of the flashback scenes,positive,1
the comparison is perhaps unfair but inevitable those attracted to the intimacy and depth of umbrellas will be slightly horrified to discover a cutandpaste musical in the american style  awkward stilted dialogue with inexplicable songanddance numbers gene kellys french accent was apparently so poor that a dreadful job of dubbing was substituted as youll remember the dubbing was almost perfectly pulled off in umbrellas the translation of the french for subtitled versions as well leaves something to be desired although this cant be attributed to demy the film also has several selfaware moments that come off a wee disconcerting such as references in songs to legrand himself and the costumes  well the tight pantswhite boots combination and the freakishly unnatural colors reminds one of an austin powers film     but demy does reward the viewer with allusions to umbrellas note for instance the suitcase carried by maxence in his departure from rochefort  this is the same suitcase carried by guy in his departure from cherbourg also note the convenient brunette of resolution  madeleine in umbrellas and josette in young girls  generally speaking those expecting the natural feel of umbrellas save the floating bicycle scene or looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings as in umbrellas script should probably pass this one b y those looking for a french version of a thin 60s american musical will be quite happy,negative,0
sunday would not be sunday without an action movie and when you want intense combat you turn to tom berenger platoon  here he plays a sniper in the jungle going after rebels and drug lords lifes a bitch so he gets a green office type billy zane to help on the mission  the film is in the hands of luis llosa who stunk up anaconda he doesnt do much better here but berenger makes the movie worthwhile  sure it may be a little long  who wants to see a lot of walking through the jungle but is is good tense action when the time is right,positive,1
i read reviews on this movie and decided to give it a shot im an open minded guy after all and i’ve given good reviews to some pretty bad flicks as the end credits rolled on this one i searched for meaning and something nice to say here goes this film was mercifully short thats all i got  okay okay the sets and visuals were well done and the music helped lend to the mood of asylum life but the film was painful to watch and the endless dialogue took away from the good bits i did find myself laughing at this film but the way you laugh at your best friend who just embarrassed himself in front of a large crowd  by the time of the chicken dance at the finale i had just decided to tuck and roll with the film and let the bodies fall where they fall i dont know what could have salvaged this film the acting was not bad and it looked like it had a budget but there just wasnt any way to make it watchable not even the presence of beautiful bare breasts maybe i should have sparked a doobie or drank a lot of beer to get the full experience of the film either way im not watching this film again unless im really depressed then i can tell myself “at least i wasn’t in ‘dr tarrs torture dungeon’ i’m better than those guys,negative,0
a wonderful free flowing often lyrical film that whisks you along ever smiling even if there are truly shocking incidents along the way one gasps at the way the women are treated and yet ultimately they seem to come through very well and it is much credit to all concerned that so many potentially disastrous scenes all work so very well this is possibly depardieus best performance certainly his most natural jeanne moreau performs outstandingly in what must have been a very difficult role to play and including vigorous sex scenes with a couple of guys at least half her age mioumiou is lovely throughout and again has very difficult scenes to play initially this seems a down and dirty misogynist rantromp but as the tale and characters unfold a much more tender and honest picture emerges in the end this uncompromising and daring film demands respect,positive,1
just saw this at the 2003 vancouver international film festival and it was funny as hell and a bit surreal takes place in toronto where these two losers live in this rundown house in the middle of a freeway system david hewlett pin cube cypher and andrew miller cube are just great as the two losers who wish the world would just go away the acting dialogue and writing are very good and the whole film looks great for such a lowbudget flick directorwriter vincenzo natali was in attendance at this screening and he seemed so intelligent and downtoearth this guy is so inventive with these great stories that work so well within small budgets it puts big budget hollywood crap to shame,positive,1
we see at the beginning of little dieter needs to fly dieter dengler the subject of the film an obsessivecompulsive or at least thats what he seems to be by way of constantly openingclosing doors and with his large stockpile of food in the cellar in a way director werner herzog sets up a central question in a manner of speaking to why dieter is like this well in fact hes not necessarily obsessivecompulsive as he is just well prepared and why shouldnt he be after the life hes lived aside from the juiciest most dark and exhilarating and frightening and just downright haunting story of survival thats the core of the picture the backstory to dieter is fascinating too dieters own childhood for example was already a slog from the start being in postwar germnay poor in a family without much food or prospects eating wallpaper for the blue in the walls but enter in a passion an unyielding desire which of course is part of herzogs bread  butter and love of man in his films which is flying and for dieter there was nothing else but to fulfill this what it ends up leading to after becoming an american citizen is more than he couldve bargained for  dieter is one of herzogs most compelling quirky and compassionately observed figures in his whole career a man whos memory is scarred by brutal memories of his time being a vietnam pow though at the least it provides for some of the most compelling storytelling in any documentary of the last 20 years ironically the storytelling comes through unlike in the wild blue yonder mostly in lots and lots of exposition from dieter on some of the most minute details of his time in the different prison camps the torture tactics the bugs the brutal wretched violence and threats like with the wedding ring tale and leading into the most interesting and sad portions with his best friend duane they escaped the prisons together but found that their journey to reach cambodia would not be so easy now through most of this the talking does something that is enthralling which is that as dieter goes through his stories and occasionally does reenactments in fashion herzog could only do with dieter already middleaged being led in handcuffs et all through the jungle one can picture all of this in the mind it all becomes even more vivid to try and get these little details and the intensity of it all together into a form of reality that herzog keeps these portions simple and knows when to hold dieter back in his answers makes him all the more a key figure of interest hes not ever totally normal but unlike a timothy treadwell you wont think ever really about laughing at him either  so along with his hero whether of war or not is hard to say as dieter disputes that claim as saying the ones who died were the real heroes typical but perhaps quite true herzog stylizes his film with a mix of old stock footage when detailing dieters early life the period footage of ww2 scenes and post german rubble is always a captivating sight and with herzog gets up a notch in his timing and assemblage with music and in capturing the footage of vietnam in aerial viewings of jungles and fields herzog is also very wise at not injecting politics much at all into the proceedings theres no i was used by the americans or whatever thrown into the mix theres even a sense that dieter doesnt hold too much of a grudge with everything that happened to him that its just what happens in time of war and of course he was dropping bombs on people from his plane now through much of these harrowing and even in the smaller bits involving what went on in prisons bathrooms and the scraps of food its always harrowing luckily herzog keeps a level of humor in check as well one of my very favorite scenes in the film where herzog breaks away for a moment from dieter is when he shows a trainee film used for american soldiers meant to show what should happen in case they get abandoned in the jungle alonewith all of the gear that they could possibly have including a knife a flare gun and a very fast helicopter to come around and this is put to hilariously deadpan voiceover work  yet even the moments where one laughs only brings to mind the moments of absurdity in a time of absolute crisis and how one cant ever really imagine what its like to be alone in a foreign territory surrounded by people who will do anything to keep said person as a form of collateral in wartime dieter aside from knowing that flying and airplanes are the only way of life he would ever want to have and herzog ends the film on a wonderfully somber elegiac note where he flies over a large field of airplanes knows what it is to have to survive at all costs but yet as well as in many of herzogs protagonist driven films theres the near unalterable spirit that will keep on enduring if ones strong enough even through horrid moments the fate of dunae and problems all the way up to the rescue by the helicopter is he american or a spy they ask on the chopper dieter is such a man with a spirit and hes given via herzog a fantastic tragic creative wellshot albeit maybe too short tribute to his life and of course it pumps me up even more for the upcoming dramatization rescue dawn,positive,1
definitely needed a little work in season 2 such as the virus between max and logan and ames white along with his ancient super cult during season two however the only thing that kept me watching was to see if max and logan would ever get rid of the nasty virus infecting max very good drama in season two but of course like all tv shows if theres something a little wrong with it the broadcasting company takes it off the air i was seriously hoping for a third and final season season 2 leaves you hanging unless you read the books by max allan collins then you will know what happens  dark angel should be put back on the air for one more season even though it might cost a lot just to get all the original actors again since jessica albas carrier sky rocketed after the show if that would be the case then there should be a movie to complete it just like the show firefly which of course fox canceled as well,positive,1
gédéon and jules naudet wanted to film a documentary about rookie new york city firefighters what they got was the only film footage inside the world trade center on september 11  having worked with james hanlons ladder company before jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak while gédéon stayed at the firehouse in case anything interesting happened an airplane flying low over the city distracted jules and he pointed the camera up seconds before the plane crashed into tower one  jules asked the captain to follow him into the towers the first thing he saw was two people on fire something he refused to film he stayed on site for the next several hours filming reactions of the firefighters and others who were there  the brothers naudet took great care in not making the movie too violent grizzly and gory but the language from the firefighters is a little coarse and cbs showed a lot of balls airing it uncensored the brothers naudet mixed footage they filmed with oneonone interviews so the firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during particular moments of the crisis   unlike a feature film of similar title most of the money from dvd sales go to 911related charities very well made emotional moving and completely devoid of political propaganda is the best documentary of the sort to date,positive,1
after reading the book which had a lot of meaning for me the movie didnt give me any of the feeling which the book conveyed this makes me wonder if kaufman even liked this book for he successfully made it into something elseeither that or he is simply bad most importantly where is the lightness from the very first scene music drownes out most of the dialogue and feeling and this continues right through the movie i think the makers thought that by having upbeat music playing right through the movie this would make the story feel light however they have completely failed here instead the music manages to give everything that movie feel in a way dramatising events so that we linger on them so that everything actually feels heavy  another example of the how this adaptation fails is by embellishing the story line making it more dramatic in the movie we see franz passing tomas on the street who is on his way to see sabina the introduction of this chance meetingpassing which im sure didnt happen in the book gives tomas story more significance than it does make it light  there are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed imo for the worst however this might have been done because the book simply doesnt convert well into a movie such is kunderas style this makes we wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site were writing with their book and movie experience in mind rather than writing about just the film a film which is as long as it is uncompelling for those who havent read the book yet i recommend just reading that for those who have i have to say you will just be wasting your time and probably end up here writing similar stayclear warnings,negative,0
this film is terrible  honestly the acting is terrible the script made me cringe the effects are completely lousy which i usually dont mind for older films but this was made just two years ago and everything about it just annoys me a few friends go out on halloween into the woods and meet a witch and her cannibal son of course before that it has the cliché you really believe that ha ha ha its just a story routine dragged out for a while the witchs cannibal son was made a retard i dont know if it was for comedy or to make it creepy but this film failed at both it has minimal gore and no nudity which made a bad film even worse heck the only good thing about this film is the leg eating scene and even that could of been better  honestly dont even waste your time watching it on cable and certainly dont consider buying or renting this else youll be kicking yourself for wasting time which could of been spent doing something more constructive or entertaining,negative,0
this is the worst movie ive ever seen and i have seen lots of movies me and my friends rented this one a wendsday evening man we had lots of fun this movie is the worst most boring crap ive ever seen but it makes you laugh u will lay on the floor rolling around tryin to get some air you wonder why just rent it and check for the keyboard playing girl at that sleazy russian bar my mother would make a 1000 times better movie about her feedin the cats,negative,0
this movie has become an iconic standin for what is great about america   fame is famous for its music and performances there are several standout actors singers and dancers including irene cara paul mccrae anne meara and the superb gene anthony ray   the plot is not the movie it follows an interesting format  but it all really ends in a kind of mush  where parker succeeds is in pushing this movie into periodic overdrive  with the extremely poignant sometimes beautiful and outright campy music score  performances  the films climax is a songdance fest of musiciansdancers  score by christopher gore a wonderment to behold    an interesting note about the magnificent and superbly talented anne meara  sometimes talent must reside in the genes  ms meara is married to one jerry stiller and is the mother of ben stiller ,positive,1
a quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb 80s inbredbackwood slashfest the type where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die however jbd delivers considerably more  rather than focus on bare flesh and gore though there is a little of each no sex however the flick focuses on delivering impending dreadmounting tension amidst a lovely scenic backdrop these feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically likable characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil oh yeah george kennedy is here too and when is that not a good thing   if you liked wrong turn then watch this to see where much of its methodology came from,positive,1
i would like to say that curiosity got the best of me if only i saw a trailer id be able to tell you the whole plot of the movie i could have saved myself the most pointless one hour and forty minutes in my entire life and about twenty dollars this movie was a disaster waiting to happen and it is an embarrassment to hollywood  the movie displays a vivid ignorance of reality for example this kids remote control race car goes all over the neighborhood and even enters this house its even covered with clothes is it not rational to believe that a remote can no longer transmit a signal under those circumstances hollywood obviously did not believe so common logic and any concept of electronics dictates the opposite i doubt the race car could even have reached the street let alone a house across the street another unrealistic trait is the lack of intelligence the criminals possess why is it in all these movies these criminals are rocket scientists until they encounter an eightyear old the kid is meant to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists please theres more reality in the matrix also the leader puts down his real pistol and accidentally picks up a plastic pistol apparently he could not tell the difference even with a glove on one should be able to do that just because they look the same does not mean anything there is other senses then sight the traps are unrealistic as well if any one of them actually worked the criminals would be dead but hollywood intends for us to laugh at the funny results of the traps i did not laugh i sighed and rolled my eyes  but i recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they have seen a really bad movie the movie they saw will seem like citizen kane compared to this one otherwise skip this one for the sake of your pride home alone 3 also raises a question we all know alex d linz stars in the movie but did he write it as well,negative,0
this movie is at times a wild 80s college sex comedy others a sweet romantic one then it has moments of serious drama and then sprinkles in dashes of science fiction it is so uneven its almost ridiculous  but i would hardly rank it as one of the worst films ive ever seen except of course for the fact that they casted peter otoole  there is absolutely nothing for him to work with here poor dialog poor performances to work off of poor everything and yet hes fantastic there is not one good thing about his part and yet he makes it work if only on pure charm alone  the fact that he was so able to achieve so much with so little shines a spotlight on how greatly everyone else in this film failed making it seem even worse than i suppose it actually is  if any other actor was in otooles role i would have forgotten this movie as crap and never thought of it again but a fine performance by peter otoole despite all odds ensures that ill remember this film for a long time to come if only as a film that maybe could have been good if anyone involved in it was nearly half as good as peter otoole,negative,0

the film had it moments but was disappointing in my eyes anyway it was a reworking of trespass walter hill and so the treasure of the sierra madre with less tension bite and human emotion there was some nice acting but the story was limp and lacked any real depth i watched the movie for mr reno and mr fishburn neither were inspired and both had little to say or act out of their skin for this movie has been done to death in the past and did not have to be made eats up money which could be used on better movies for an action movie it was sparse of action and as a thriller did not thrill better than watching snow fall but not for me,negative,0

this film was rather a disappointment after the very slow very intense and quite gory beginning the film begins to lose it too much plot leaves too little time for explanation and coming out of the theater i wondered what this was all about the characters remain shallow the story is not convincing at all most of it is déja vù stuff without hints of parody and there are some very cheesy parts like the young cop has to do dig up a body of course its night and it rains and he has to do it alone yawn or the manifestation of the evil being nazis plus genetic manipulation wow thats really original there are some nice bits though like the fistfight scene mountain views and some running gags but though reno and vincent cassel do what they can thats definitely not worth it 3 out of 10,negative,0
i dont usually comment but there are things that need to be said where to start  the acting on jeremy londons part was horrible i didnt think he could be so bad the plot could have been good had it been well directed along with a good solid performance from the lead actor unfortunately this is one of those movies you read about and think it has great potential to be entertaining but get disappointed from the start   well at least i got good laughs i wouldnt waste my time if i were you,negative,0
after buying the dvd in a bargain bin due to the impressive amount of features listed on the cover i popped it in the dvd player and everything looked good nice animated menus and a whole lot of extra featuresbut when i played the movie itself what a let down it is the worst thing i have ever seen and i have seen some bad movies in my time the comment that praises the movie here at imdb is actually from the people who made the film so dont believe it unless you like to waste your cash,negative,0
i would have enjoyed this movie slightly more had not been for jason herb evers constant harping on experiment many early reviewers of the seven samurai accused toshiro mifune of overacting yet as more and more critics viewed that film they saw it as being purposefully done jason evers is obviously not toshiro mifune and his overacting is exactly that  most of the actors in this b classic were rather good actors minus evers and the showgirls if you watch this movie you would have noticed evers shouting almost every line that is until he is smoking and blowing the smoke coolly out his nose   the special effects were par for the course in a b movie such as this one in hindsight there isnt much that stands out in my mind as fantastically good or bad for this movie,negative,0

bugsy siegel was 31 when he went out to the west coast in addition to his dreams about las vegas he toyed with the idea of acting he was a good looking guy and about 7 years younger than his pal george raft so it wasnt such a crazy idea  warren beatty was 54 when he made this movie and despite the hair dye hes too old for this part beatty was miscast bugsy should have been played by someone like alec baldwin bugsy was a tough guy feared by his contemporaries beatty just doesnt radiate menace  this was a vanity project for beatty who hasnt come to terms with the fact that hes no longer a leading man  the other big annoying miscast is mantegna as george raft raft had a distinctive voice and mannerisms none of which mantegna even attempts to match you never once believe that mantegna came from the streets  warren beatty and robert redford have both been pretending to be younger for years by massive use of hair dye and now itll be a shock to suddenly go gray and play character parts,negative,0

i watched this movie probably more than 20 times the jokes are now 1015 years old but every time i watch it it makes me fall off my chair two of the finest actor salman khan and aamir khan plays the lead roles here even if aamir khan is a much better actor and got the better rolesmart guy in the movie salman khan matches and sometimes perform even better as the dumb guy all the characters are memorable this movie is filled with hilarious oneliners and funny situationsa little too silly probably dont try to look for logic in this movie let your brain relax for some time i promise it will be an experience to remember,positive,1

this film an early william wellman has an important message particularly today it posits the notion that sometimes there are things more important than your own personal safty or wellbeing the film which has walter huston as the lead is stolen by the performance of chic sales as grampa hes the most completely drawn character in the film and a joy to watch youll recognize some familiar faces if you watch many movies from the 20s and 30s wel worh your time to watch if you get the opportunity recommended,positive,1
this movie is a ripoff of james cains novel the postman always rings twice apparently the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this storyperhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the italians in wwii might account for their forgetting to consider royalties despite this the movie isnt really just an italian version of the hollywood movie in some ways its a lot better and in other ways it is definitely not  the three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people in fact the male and female lovers are a bit ickylooking the male lead is pretty ordinary except for his profuse body hair particularly on the back and shoulders and his lady love is to put it frankly unattractive they are a very very far cry from lana turner and john garfield in the hollywood version and the illfated husband is really really obese and loves to walk around shirtlessand his counterpart in the american film cecil kellaway is definitely better looking and probably better looking than the other two italian leads actually and this unattractiveness is generally a reason i actually preferred the italian filmsince i just could not imagine a finely coiffed dish like lana turner in the middle of nowhere married to kellawayi am 100 sure she would have had dozens of better offers whereas the italian wife frankly might not have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believable  part of the italian films believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex the sanitized american film tries to make you believe that although turner and garfield kill kellaway they never actually get around to sex this is pretty silly and totally unrealistic in addition to the casual sexuality of the film its also pretty casual in showing the seamy side of lifewith lots of sweaty people a fly strip hanging over the kitchen table and everyone appeared to need a bath  the movie is also pretty fastpaced compared to the overlong american film and what you get due to brevity isnt all good the film lacks a lot of the style and polish of the american filmwith grainier footage relatively poor orchestration and sets it sure aint a pretty film but the neorealisticlike style makes the film seem more realistic but it cannot make up for the shortcuts in the plot many of the plot elements in the later american version are either missing entirely or glossed over and the ending seems a lot less interesting than the american filmand misses the entire human nature dilemma when turner and garfield turn on each other like rats the best part of the american film  so which is the better film well a lot of this probably depends on you as for me the warner brothers film was simply too polished and too unrealistic though many like this style and may dislike watching films with subtitlesbut it packed a great ending and the italian film was much much more realisticuntil the crappy ending that seemed too rushed so neither film is exactly great but id give my nod to the italian one being a bit better its too bad they couldnt have combined the best elements of both films into one exceptional film,positive,1
demon wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs it is definitely an awful example of a film so awful in fact that i dont even consider it a movie i describe it more as a thing  a monstrous thing a thing that must be stopped at all costs my friends and i first discovered this  thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friends house it was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies we unfortunately picked this one well during the 90 minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up the thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word its just a cheap poorly done ripoff of evil dead the whole story seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demons rip them to pieces i have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed ive seen bad horror movies before manos troll 2 hobgoblins shudder i would have to say that demon wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid films  fun fact this film is like a cockroach on steroids much like the ouija board every time we try to get rid of it it always seems to mysteriously reappear kind of scary huh,negative,0
i rented this by mistake i thought after a cursory examination of the box that this was a timetravelscifi story instead its a christian story and i suppose is fairly typical example if you are sold on the message you probably will overlook the awkwardness of the plotactingetc but i found it rather painful   i have to admit that im bothered by the rewriting of history in this story it paints the 1890s as some sort of paradise of family values and morality a character is aghast that 5 of marriages end in divorce but it overlooks very unsavory sides of this highly moral society rigid racial sexual and social discrimination were widespread for instance and at one point the hero complains to a clothing store owner about things that sound not all that different than the complaints of some iranian leaders about womens clothing styles as reported in a recent wsj  overall thought i suppose that its the sort of thing youll like if you like this sort of thing and its certainly wholesome,negative,0
oh dear what can i say about half past dead i was really disappointed in it i was thinkinga steven seagal movie cool well get to see him kick people and flip people and break bones we might even get to see him have a stick fight with somebody excellent  however i was in for a rude awakening this film can be summed up as follows  take an episode of the ateam remove the lovable and roguish characters such as murdoch hannibal mr t and face then get a writerdirector to pen a plot even ed wood would be ashamed of and whos too big a fan of the matrix and john woo movies for his own good throw in a bunch of people with really bad acting ability and who dont have real names finally add in a main star whos getting saggy around the midriff and doesnt appear to be able to do his own stunts anymore   the result half past dead an action movie so ridiculous that it at least made me smile right the way through the plot holes are stupendously glaringly large  for example prisoners who when the jail is invaded fight the invaders rather than attempting to escape or how about the prison itself which has an armoury that contains heavy machineguns and rocketpropelled grenade launchers you also have a helicopter bearing a striking resemblance to a huey with some kind of video game machinegun mounted in the nose  then theres seagal himself i like the guy he can fight hes even witty in a way that jeanclaude van damme will never be but all through the movie i kept hoping for that one great defining fight scene never happened instead we got people firing guns a lot and not hitting a whole hell of a lot i mean when someone runs down a narrow corridor and you fire a submachinegun at them there isnt a whole lot of places the bullets can go other than down the corridor and into the target yet somehow they miss even the ateam would cringe at this foolishness and then when it gets to any kind of oneonone physical stuff we get treated to a shabby matrix ripoff without the benefit of bullettime people getting kicked twenty feet through the air and sundry other ludicrous acrobatic nonsense  cmon steven youre better than this your career cant be over say it aint so  this is instantly forgettable except im forcing myself to remember for the purposes of this review and if you watch it try to find it amusing in an ateam kind of way but i doubt itll be high on anyones rewatchable list out for justice this aint more like out to lunch,negative,0
looking for quo vadis at my local video store i found this 1985 version that looked interesting wow it was amazing very much a ken russell kind of film quirky stylized very artistic and of course different nero was presented not so much as evil incarnate but as a wacky unfulfilled emperor who would rather have had a circus career he probably wondered why on earth he was put in the position of leading an empire it wasnt much fun and fun is what he longed for klause maria bandaur had a tremendous time with this role and played it for all it was worth yes nero persecuted the christians with a vengeance one of many who did so at one point one of his henchmen murmurs no one will ever understand we were simply protecting ourselves he got that right,positive,1

all films made before 1912 really need to be viewed with a sense of time and place  in 1894 the lumierefamily men father antoine 18401911 sons auguste and louis owned and managed a factory that manufactured photographic plates and paper not a small enterprise the factory had more than 200 employees who received pension and social security benefits  innovative for that time it was located at montplaisir in the suburbs of lyon france what caused louis lumiere to become interested in building a cinematagraph in 1894 remains open for speculation my suggestion is that the appearance of the edison organizations kinetoscope peepshow machine in paris during the fall of 1894 provided the catalyst  wkl dickson of edisons staff invented a motionpicture camera about the size of an upright piano that was patented in february 1893 it was electrically operated using power from from heavy storage batteries this massive machine pumped celluloid film strip newly developed by the eastman company past a lens at about 40 framespersecond fps it was ensconced as an almost immovable object in the black maria essentially the first movie studio the kinetescope machines showed staged presentations less than oneminute longthat were filmed in this studio  during 1894 louis lumiere applied himself to the task of inventing a movingpicture camera he had determined that even at 16 fps on celluloid film the persistenceofvision of the human eyebrain would allow for normal motion to be perceived his camera dubbed the cinematograph was about the size of a large shoe box and was provided with a detachable film magazine that provided storage for enough film to make a shoot last about one minute when it was had cranked past the lens at 16 fps  the size and light weight of the camera it could be converted into a printer or a projector by the addition of a light source made it portable enough that it could be taken to any location to record an event provided there was enough sunlight available in the spring of 1895 louis filmed trickriding by some cavalry men a house on fire with firemen arriving and dousing the engulfed building with water and a number of other scenes in and around lyon using a molteni bulb he turned the camera into a projector and presented his films to scientists assembled in the reception room of the revue generales des science the images were projected on a screen fivemeters distant from the lens the screen was stretched in a doorway between two rooms at a meeting of professional photographers that same year louis photographed the arriving delegates and the same evening showed them motion pictures of their arrival  with accolades from both the scientific and photographic communities louis decided to have a public exhibition of his invention by the end of the year since each of his films would be about oneminute long he would need at least a dozen films to make a good presentation for one of these films he set up his camera at the entrance to his factory photographing the egress of employees at quittingtime  the public venue chosen by antoine  who offered himself as the fairground barker for the cinematograph  was the salon indien of the grand cafe on the boulevard des capucines in paris it was a wintry saturday night on 28 december 1895 as the first audience sat they were presented with a projected view of the exterior of the lumiere factory with closed gates some were chagrined that they were just going to see a routine slide show of lumiere photographs but then the crank on the cameraprojector was turned and movement began louis had an innate sense for motion picture taking this film has a beginning a middle and an end in the beginning the doors are opened and people begin to leave their workplace during the middle the people stream out  with many trying to ignore the camera and the cameraman as they seem to be happy to leave a day of labor behind them at the end the gates to the factory are being closed  and this was the first film projected for the entertainment of the general public,positive,1
the summary is only for those who hate this movie as finding the movie ok or average is acceptable visiting this movie on imdb has made me nostalgic as i cant help myself going back in the year 1994 i was one of the few lucky ones who saw this movie in theaters it instantly became one of my favourite comedies and took some years to make it my favourite how can i say what made this movie my favourite was it the excellent writing  story was ok but screenplay and dialogues were fabulous was it the superlative performances was it the mood of the film  after thinking about it for so many years i say it has to be a mixture it is one of those movies which didnt have any flaws not even its musicthe other movie coming up in my mind right now is sholay  ps rajkumar santoshi please keep a balance between your drama and comedy movies only 1 comedy is not enough i want moreeeeeeee,positive,1
kpax is exactly what a heart warming film should be the story is about a mysterious mental patient prot played by kevin spacey and his unbelieving psychiatrist dr powel played by jeff bridges the two have a very friendly bond and as their relationship grows dr powel cant help but wonder whether or not there is more to his mysterious patient who insists he is from another planet called kpax this film is very funny and kevin spacey pulls of well placed one liners as if it was his second nature kpax is a smart film and i wasnt expecting it to go where it did in the end i found myself thinking about the small things in life and the wonder and magic of the every day life we so often take for granted i left the theater with a warm fuzzy feeling inside and for families and couples on a date kpax is a splendid film that will not disappoint i highly recommend this film to anyone interested in something more than the monotonous releases of glossy action packed gore fests,positive,1
i have wanted to see this for the longest time james merendino is a great director slc punk is one of my favorite movies and in the first ten minutes of this film i thought that it was a great follow up after that though it begins to drag the acting and direction were terrific in fact everything in the film seemed to flow except for the script at times the only thing keeping my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world claire forlani this film was good but i expected more  ps look for great cameos by chi mcbride and chris mcdonald,positive,1
i discovered the patriot in a dvdstore and thought it could be a real action thriller no it´s instead a low budget movie with a ridiculous story it´s no doubt a cablemovie and not one for the theatre fortunately after 90 minutes the movie stops otherwise the audience should have taken an antivirus against sleep one thing came over it was the nice country the film has been shot you can really feel the american air but that´s all i hope for steven seagal that he finally succeeds in a big hit it is not a must see because i and my wife voted average 410,negative,0
sick really stands for so incredibly crappy i killed myself there was absolutely no acting to speak of the best part of the whole production was the art work on the cover of the boxthe budgeting of this movie was sufficient the filming was sub sesame street the production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits the props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store the ending was so predictable you should fast forward to the last 5 minutes and laugh if there is a book out there for this movie im sure its better i would avoid this at all costs i did enjoy the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth it just kidding,negative,0
this is probably the only film ive seen where the imdb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100 accurate the stupids is an atrocious dimwitted film with absolutely no artistic merit whatsoever and is a denigration to a director like john landis and thats what makes it great  in order to appreciate the stupids you have to keep in mind a littleknown but very true maxim spoken by director abo kyrou i urge you to learn to look at bad films they are so often sublime in order for any film to work the film must establish and follow its own logic and if it does so convincingly and sincerely then its actually possible for the film to work for example when you watch freddy got fingered as a traditional grossout comedy its complete and utter garbage when you watch it with the understanding that its actually a neosurrealist comedy its brilliant  it works with good movies too if jaws hadnt accepted the reality it created the airtank explosion ending wouldnt have worked but a lot of people think jaws is vastly overrated for this type of reason and they arent wrong but it has its strengths doesnt it the point being that a movie like this makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective some people like me get it right away while others never will no matter how often its explained jim jarmusch made a compelling defense of showgirls once and even afterwards i still cant see it from his pov doesnt mean hes wrong though if you have the right frame of mind when you watch this movie and no i do not mean stoned im gonna put that to bed right now you can actually enjoy the movie for the dumb cheap pointless slapstick late80searly90sstyle farce that it is  the defenders and haters of this film are right its stupid and thats the point the movie accepts the stupidity of the characters much in the same way the jerk accepted navin johnsons idiocy and because it takes that and runs with it the movie focuses exclusively on using that to forward the plot and to define the characters a bad movie would actually do this and fail to use that logic properly bad movie are bad because they make it up as they go along whereas movies like the stupids knows where its going what its doing and why from the beginning  i cant defend the film from an artistic standpoint which is why i give it such a low rating the acting is mostly bad the jokes very superficial and the liveaction quality probably ruins what would have worked as a cartoon but i cant deny that it is entertaining in its own way and thats why i defend it i got it right away and i pity those who dont  ill admit i was drawn to this movie because of christopher lees delicious cameo appearance hearing him say release the drive bee would have been worth the rental price even if i hated this film but was amazed to find that aside from the tv studio applause sign segment with jenny mccarthy i was never bored and never disappointed in fact many of the jokes because of their cartoonish context were hilarious in particular the airbagcigarette explosion they were dumb but they were funny and the movie doesnt pretend to be anything else a stupid comedy about stupid characters and instead of apologizing for it it enjoys itself  and thats exactly why it works,negative,0
without peter ustinov and maggie smith this could easily have been a turkey but they are brilliant ustinov is at his best and for fans of maggie it is great to see her in her early days matching ustinov every step of the way for with and timing for englishmen in their fifties and i am in that bracket it is always entertaining to see glimpses of and hear sounds of the swinging sixties and although this film spends a lot of time in offices it has plenty of sixties nostalgia including red buses carnaby street a song by lulu and a delicious shot up the microskirt of a waitress the like of which england has never seen since in public places as an it engineer i know that the computer hacking tricks are laughable but they are not meant to be taken seriously nor are the wonderful stereotypes of italians french and germans,positive,1
what ever happened to michael keaton what a great actor and he proves it in this movie this movie is actually funny and the reason why this movie is funny is for two reasons an excellent script and michael keaton this movie is one of the funniest comedies in the history of hollywood this movie is the ultimate spoof of gangster movies in this movie hollywood actually pokes fun at itself by using the the gangster movie genre as the basis for a truly original comedy the rest of the cast is funny too especially the supporting cast if you like to laugh and want to watch a movie that contains nonstop humor then this movie is for you,positive,1
well when watching this film late one night i was simple amazed by its greatness fantastic script great acting costumes and special effects and the plot twists wow in fact if you can see the ending coming you should become a writer yourself  great i would recommend this film to anyone especially if i dont like them much  terrific,positive,1
its one of the imponderables of lowbudget independent filmmaking that so many with so little in the way of real talent fancy themselves frightmeisters the paucity of talent evinced by these wonky wannabees is there for all the world to see case in point flight of the living dead or as i quickly came to know it shite of the living dead theres nothing wrong with paying homage to ones heroes ive done it many times over the years myself in many different ways in fact in the xlibris book the night riders cowritten with m kelley i dedicate it in part to the six writers whose work inspires me still richard matheson harlan ellison shirley jackson edgar allen poe hp lovecraft and robert e howard had it been a motion picture i wouldve dedicated it to the directors whose films have inspired me over the years very high up on that list wouldve been george romero its nothing less than a crying shame that the makers of this film werent truly as inspired by romero as their title suggests,negative,0
ok now at first i thought this was going to be another cheesy romantic comedy which held back on the comedy but this wasnt i mean how could it have been with the fabulous amanda bynes staring in it she was amazing really funny  is still stunning the boys in it were also extremely fit one major reason for going girls the plot is strongly based upon the shakespeare play twelfth night as it was extremely similar there was even a spider called malvolio which belonged to the malvolio like character the script was really well written and pulled together and it was very witty the football skills in it were also amazing it even made me think of playing football myself anyway to sum it up this is a light hearted film about young romance which gets very confusing go and see it,positive,1
i have to admit ive caught this one a few times on the usa network theres just something about the well sheer stupidity of this flick which makes me want to watch it whenever its on yes youre right about the subpar acting the plot which only an seven year old could like etc but i cant help feeling sympathetic toward some of the actors then again a few of these actors signed up for the even more atrocious sequel,negative,0
i went into watching this movie knowing it wasnt going to be great but what i witnessed was to awful for words i dont mean to be harsh its just the movie was terrible overall it had bad i mean awful special effects the acting wasnt too bad but wasnt good either and sasquatch himself was like well not sasquatch in my opinion the best sasquatch movie is harry and the hendersons its not violent or horror but it has the best depiction of sasquatch at least its a suit and not some halfass cgi ripoff only see this movie if you are desperate or really appreciate anyone in the film or go watch boondock saints it is much better,negative,0
i enjoyed still crazy more than any film i have seen in years a successful band from the 70s decide to give it another try they start by playing some gigs in some seedy european venues with hilarious results the music is fantastic the script and acting are terrific the characters are spot on especially the lead singer with the high heavy metal voice makeup and personality problems the concert at the end was unreal go and see it preferably in a cinema with a good sound system ,positive,1
nightbreed is definitely my most favorite movie ive worn more than one tape as it is the makeup is awesome the story is lovely it takes a few different twists and isnt quite as deep as the story its based on cabal by clive barker but for a movie adaption it stays very true to source material the only problem with this movie were the producers vain attempts to turn it into a teen slasher movie hence the changed ending to allow for sequels eye rolls apparently someday were going to be getting a directors cut that will i hope clear up this bit of nonsense until then id suggest it to anyone who like dark fantasy type horror as opposed to freddyjasonmicheal type slashers i really dont know what would be comparable,positive,1
and how it made it into production astounds me the main character is an obnoxious show off who isnt the least bit funny i cant stand the character at all hes a dumb ass with nothing to offer the show   this is the worst cartoon to surface in the last 10 years no joke the story lines are both poorly written and executed the jokes are as bad as the ones on disneys sweet life of zack and cody i could not dislike this show more its terrible and should be canceled even the theme song is bad the title even worse  its as though this show is written by a couple of 15 year olds that based the character on themselves and think theyre hot stuff when theyre really just arrogant and lack creativity as well as humor  johnny test go away far and fast,negative,0
sending the critters to space does seem like an entertaining idea but was there really any need for a third film much less this fourth one a film with brad dourif cant be all bad can it well maybe in this case this cheap scifi effort stars returning lovable klutz charliethe reliable don keith opper who is about to eradicate the last two remaining eggs of the critters species when ughterrence manntells him that hes about to break some sort of transgalactic endangered species law so at ughs request charlie places the two eggs in special holders inside a space pod unfortunately for charlie the damn thing takes off for space and hes trapped inside the smoke under his feet places him into hibernation stasis and he awakes 53 years later inside a decrepit  space station as captain rick with fat cigar rude alcoholic malevolence and greedy to the core is blasting open the space pod trying to see what possible novelties are inside for possible sale or trade rick unbeknownest to him lets out the two critters who feast on his flesh you see rick and his crew found the space pod drifting and had intense dollar signs flashing in their eyes so they dock it ugh reports to themnow in a fine prominent position as counselorthat money can be made if they dock at a space station under the terracor organization once the crew dock they find that this station is in ruin with many corridors in bad condition but whats worse is the station computer angela angela is a real thorn in the side to the crew because she has been left unrepaired without proper maintenance for some time it takes some little tricks to get doors to open and close not to mention the elevators and computers brad dourif is al bert pretty much the impresario of computer functionsand is pretty much the real leader of the group for he is the most levelheaded and intelligent he seems to be a fatherfigure to ethanpaul witthornewho just wants to make it to earth to find his fatherthis story though doesnt necessarily reach its zenith bernieeric dareis primarily in the film to be a druggie victim for the critters to munch on in the film charlie after one critter enters ricks mouth and eats away at his throatyuk becomes the crews guide in understanding what they are fighting against the film has some elements i found rather confusingor for a better word ridiculousthe two critters grow in size quickly are somehow able to coordinate a ship for earth not to mention grow themselves to massive size in this laboratory in the space station the crew are able to tap into a log from a dr mccormickanne ramsay whose badge is found in a coat thrown to the side for which ethan discovers her access cardwhich shows signs that terracor was looking into creating a species to exterminate worlds and people knowing this bothers al bert who wishes to leave angela and her bleeding station for greener pastures things dont work out that way because wellmeaning charliethanks in part to al berts ancient colt 45kills a critter which had got on board but in firing several bullets hits major guidance systems in the ship so many repairs on in order but they halt them when ugh and his storm troopers dock at angela and prove they are not what charlie thought theyd be ugh is a changed man and charlie realizes that he is completely evil and his mission is to preserve the crites for purposes of a cruel naturerepresentation of corrupt corporate governmental types this betrayal is what changes charliehe has perhaps grown up a bita wee bitand now understands that some people just change for the worse charlie and ugh will come to a faceoff over those critterswill the crew be able to escape a space station which has set autodestruct this film really doesnt exploit the critters as much as the other three films i believe we can clearly see this as the true end to the franchise the first film was a hoota really entertaining romp but by the time this sequel cam around the critters just wore out their welcome the cast however do give the film a boost the critters do get to feed a bit but their plans of global domination is underdeveloped their role in the film isnt established to the greatest heights i said to myselfyou have this enormous space station with unfortunates trapped on board could you not take this idea and run with it sadly they dont,negative,0
this very low budget comedy caper movie succeeds only in being low budget dialog is dumbfoundingly stupid chase scenes are uniformly boring and most of the onscreen money seems to have been saved for a series of crashes and explosions in a parking lot during the films last five minutes a briefly glimpsed portapotty early in that scene is certain to wrecked and spew crap on the films chief villainno prop is here without a purpose the whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those that occasionally came out of rodger cormans studio when hed give a first time director a few bucks and a camerabut without the discipline corman would impose,negative,0
when i saw previews of this movie i thought that it may be dumb but it will at least be funny well i was wrong even though somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message to convey about parents being left alone and reevaluating their life the way they tried to deliver that message was horrible the first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny but by the end i could almost predict what stupid mishap is going to happen next  throughout the movie i like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was at best mediocre which is still more than i can say for the movie itself,negative,0
i didnt have huge expectations for this film when renting it for 1 at the video store but the box at least showed a little promise with its killer cut of more gore more sex cant go wrong there well needless to say the box is a fraud how in the hades did actors and actresses of this caliber sign on for a film this low  it all opens with a drunken college girl walking out of a frat house or some other building like that and saying some useless crap to her boyfriend  as a camera on a bad steadicam follows her then she gets chased by some dude in a clear plastic mask and grabbed by another they slit her wrists for no real reason and you can see when they cut her that someone drew the cuts with what looks like a crayon  from there repeat the same theme of the girl getting chasedkilled unbrutally by two guys for about 84 more minutes add in one tit shot that is soul survivors  i wouldnt have had a problem with this film had the box not frauded me into renting the flick if i rent a bad film that claims to have more violence and sex i want more violence and sex one full frontal shot in 85 minutes from a chick who is clearly androginous and gore that would not scare a child does not cut it if this is the killer cut what is the theatrical cut of course i doubt this garbage was actually put into theaters in the first place shame on the actors in this film i could see them making their screen debuts in here because they have not done anything before but they were all established before this was released i dont know if it was filmed before they had all been established and the studio sat on the film until they were semibig names or not but what i want to know is they really spent 14 million on this film,negative,0
as a casual listener of the rolling stones i thought this might be interesting not so as this film is very of its age in the 1960s to me someone born in the 1980s this just looks to me as hippy purist propaganda crap but i am sure this film was not made for me but people who were active during th 60s i expected drugs galore with th stones i was disappointed it actually showed real life hard work in the studio so much so i felt as if i was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film i have not seen any of the directors other films but i suspect they follow a similar style of directing sort of amatuerish which gave a feeling like the tv show eurotrash badly directed tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value my only good opinion of this is that i didnt waste money on it it came free with a sunday paper,negative,0
maybe it gets better i wouldnt know i made it through the first twenty minutes or so before cutting it off and entering a period of mourning it was obvious that the plot itself was a familiar one a man paul lematt a professor of entymology at columbia drives with his dog to a small town in ohio in search of his ex wife diana scarwid there he encounters people who either ignore him or are hostile oh they may smile but theres something going on underneath  that sort of arrangement is home turf for movie makers and viewers alike and its pregnant with possibilities you can turn out a neatly drawn commercial success like bad day at black rock or it would have made and probably did make a nice twilight zone episode  the cast includes some seasoned performers too as well as some formerly prominent names kenneth toby a veteran of science fiction is the superficially amiable motel manager diana scarwid can give an impressive performance as she did in say silkwood for some of the others their range is limited  but its poorly directed and shabbily written  example of shabby direction that dog of lematts is disliked by kenneth toby right off the bat so when lematt walks out to the street toby sneaks up to the window of his room peers in at the dog and something zaps cut to lematt in the street he hears his dog howling away then a pov shot of presumably the dog zipping along towards lematt then past him while the wind blows and lematt gawks at the camera cut to an identical shot  coming from the other direction whatever the camera represents whatever lematt is staring at is never shown maybe it was nothing because suddenly the wind stops and lematt is alone in the street looking a little bit puzzled you should never have brought that dog in the first place remarks a smiling toby from the porch question what the hell is that scene all about   example of shabby writing well two examples 1 if you were to sit down and write a stereotypical waitress in a smalltown diner without the exercise of any craft whatever youd come up with an expressionless babe with her hair piled on top of her head chewing gum sauntering among the tables right 2 anything resembling believability is thrown out the window in favor of special effects lematts car chugs to a halt then explodes while it is waiting to be fixed at the garage chugging to a halt believable exploding supernatural not even edgar allan poe would endorse such an event  and the invaders themselves think of a modest masterpiece like invasion of the body snatchers something is going wrong in dr kevin mccarthys small town and it takes half the movie for the mystery to be unraveled and all the time suspense is building and doubt is growing here twenty minutes into the movie a stranger walks into a motel room and tears off his plastic face revealing a pulsing lightemitting naked brain the pregnancy is aborted  i wont tell you the ending because i dont know what it is nor do i care i suppose it had something to do with insects because why else would paul lematt be an entymologist by the way whos handling his classes but im not even sure bugs were involved its entirely possible that the bug business was adventitious the writers may have made him a specialist in insects and then forgot all about it it wouldnt surprise me,negative,0

i first saw this when it was picked as a suggestion from my tivo system i like danny elfman and thought it might be interesting on top of that im a fan of max fleischers work and this started out with the look and feel of his 30s cartoon with both of those i thought it would hold my interest i was wrong just a few minutes in and i had the fast forward button down i ran through it in about 15 minutes and thought that was it  afterwards i read some of the other reviews here and figured i didnt give it enough of a chance i recorded it again and watched it through theres 75 minutes of my life im not getting back  i cant believe there arent more bad reviews personally i think its because its hard to get to the 10 line comment minimum how many ways are there to say this is a waste of time  the movie comes across as though it was made by a few junior high kids ready to outrage the world and thinking they can with breasts profanity and puke jokes the characters are flat the parody of swinging the alphabet is lame essentially cobbling the tune getting through a  e hitting the obvious profanity a f and then having no idea where to go the trip through the intestines to the expected landing doesnt work the first time let alone the following ones   across the board the entire movie is what you would expect from someone trying to outsouth park stone and parker without the ability to determine what is and isnt funny this might be amusing if youre high otherwise its not,negative,0
i really appreciate what jungwon had done before his death everything i want to say that his choice for love is unselfish if he chose darim  that will be good for him but darim will need more time to recover from his death obviously he does not want to let it happen as he did in the film he chose giving up so it was just temporary agony for darim  as comparison my life without me is very different their behavior shows big difference between eastern culture and western culture i cannot say which is better every one can has right to choose that is totally up to you life is equal for everybody we can live only once any choice is acceptable if only you think it is fit for you  in truth the slow pace of the film cannot be the excuse for rejecting the movie just calm down you will get more from the movie  one of the best korean movies i ever watched 910,positive,1
jumpin butterballs this movie stinks its a dull and listless drag that never lets up its a wonder anyone even bothered to make groucho up in his bizarre trademark eyebrows and mustache as he has nothing witty or outrageous to do or say throughout this bore chico must have been so disinterested that he forgot to use his italian accent  only harpo provides a grin or two and theres precious little of that to go around here anyway figure in a loudmouthed hotel manager and another obnoxious cocomic in frank albertson and the road gets even bumpier   a real misfire,negative,0
amidst all the many problems that make this a dire piece of celluloid is the stupidest plot device in recent cinema history richard gere determines who the jackals real target is through some form of revelation he does not work anything out it just comes to him when in doubt hes going after the first lady this film blows chunks,negative,0
john pressman micheal i shoulda called ditech lerner works at a doctors office as an orderly his mother zelda poltergeist rubenstein hypnotizes him to off the people who see thinks wronged him but this turns out to be a movie within a movie but the lines soon blur as john goes a movie theater to kill prompting a guy whos watching the movie to do the same lerner is suitably over the top in this but zelda repeats lines of dialog over and over again that gets annoying fast but not as annoying as the two girls who are watching the movie within a movieas a horror film this one fails its too busy trying to be clever trying to impart a message and seems to forget a slasher film must evoke a sense of tension or at least a jump or two no what we have here is the worst kind of slasher an arthouse one  my grade d,negative,0
the acting is excellent in this film with some great actors it was fun to see fred mcmurray as a young man this is not a comedy its a drama and the apparently comedic instances are pitiful this is not a comedy its a drama and the apparently comedic instances are pitiful and some of them appear forced and contrived its in the script though not the fault of the acting  the 10 line requirement forces me to write some morehmmm loved carole lombards my man godfrey because it is a comedy and while the acting is wonderful the story line and the script itself wins the day carole lombard is pretty and a wonderful actress i will try to watch fred mcmurrays features,negative,0
oh there are many worse wayne movies this movie is edited poorly but it has a campy element that makes watching it enjoyable the villain is an anglo actor who sports ridiculous mexican clothes and affects an overthetop mexican accent which is hilarious the girl is dressed like a jean harlow wannabe this is 1934 after all at least the location shots are beautiful and enjoyable  watch it and laugh dont expect a serious western but rather a lightweight and superficial story with poor acting but occasional flashes of camp humor wayne is almost ludicrously young and handsome and one can see his acting ability blossomed years after this regrettable venture,negative,0
this is one of the very best films ive seen in ages its right up there with the likes of trainspotting and pulp fiction it just epitomises teenage culture today the soundtrack is absolutely amazing overseen by pete tong its a must see,positive,1

this long winded film turns out to be less about berkowitz and his effect on nyc but more about painting caricatures of a certain group of italianamericans known locally as guidos the problem is that guidos are uninteresting no matter what kind of story or setting they are immersed in they are already living caricatures so lee only amplifies them rather than simply portraying them  when someone has a caricature done of themselves they dont go home and say hey lets make the ears and nose even bigger thats what lee has done in this film the most interesting characters in the film are the two adrian brody and jennifer esposito who wish to escape the guido lifestyle top it off with an uninteresting storyline for the characters particularly john leguizamos and you get a nice film to fall asleep by especially considering its lengthy run time  one more strike against it for someone proclaiming to be a yankees fan and has grown up in new york spike lee should know how to spell phil rizzuto which is spelled incorrectly in the closing credits,negative,0
i am a fan of bad horror films of the 1950s and 60sfilms so ridiculous and silly that they are good for a laugh so because of this its natural that id choose this filmespecially because with john agar in it it was practically guaranteed to be bad sadly while it was a bad film it was the worst type of bad filmdull beyond belief and unfunny at least with stupid and overthetop bad films you can laugh at the atrocious monsters and terrible direction and acting here you never really see that much of the monster mostly due to the darkness of the print and the acting while bad is more low energy badlistless and dull  the film begins with some young adults going to satans hollow to neck well considering the name of the place its not surprising when they are later found chewed to pieces duhdont go necking at satans hollow well there are reports of some sort of crashing object from the sky so what do the teens go yep throw a dance partya very very very slow dance party where the kids almost dance in slow motion so its up to the sheriff agar and his men to ensure that the teens can dance in peace without fear of mastication  as for the monster its some guy in a gorilla suit with a silly maska bit like the monster in robot monster not exactly original and not exactly high tech to make it worse it makes snorting noises and moves very very slowlyso slow that even the most corpulent teen could easily outrun it how it manages to kill repeatedly is beyond me  overall too dull to likeeven if you are a fan of lousy cinema,negative,0
i saw mommywell she wasnt exactly kissing santa clause he has his hand on her thigh and wicked thoughts in mind  this was enough to emotionally scar a young boy who wanted to believe he grew up to be a bitter man who was upset at the quality of the toys being made and the lack of christmas spirit  expecting a real slasher flick i was very disappointed that less than a handful of people dies and there was no nudity at all what a bummer  i wanted to like this flick but it was just too slow and really didnt have a good script i didnt expect great acting but i sure wanted some action there just wasnt any,negative,0
another son of sam is definitely not an oscar winner technically its horrible the acting is not too good either but there is something about it that makes you want to watch more sort of like a car wreck the ridiculous closeups of the killers eyes are more funny than anything if you are looking for a scarethis aint the flick for you its very obscure and nearly impossible to find im sure theres a reason for that for a while it was titled hostage it dont matter what you call it its still a poor choice for entertainment it might be good for a mst3000 party or something can you believe they would use such a title as another son of sam if that dont have exploitation written all over it ill eat my hat i remember when this was shot in belmont nc a lot of local personalities were used as talent,negative,0
the original was a good movie i bought it on tape and have watched it several times and though i know that sequels are not usually as good as the original i certainly wasnt expecting such a bomb the romance was flat the sight gags old the spoken humor just wasnt this may not have been the worst movie ive ever seen but it comes close,negative,0
i was so disappointed in this movie i dont know much about the true story so i was eager to see it play out on film and educate myself about a little slice of history with such a powerful true story and great actors it seemed like a surefire combination well somewhere the screenplay failed them it was so scattered  is this movie about his childhood his love life his own disability his speaking ability his passion for the disabled im sure there is a way to incorporate all of those things into a good story but this movie wasnt it i was left cold watching characters that were unlikable not because of their disabilities but because of their personalities other small gripes 1 the heavyhanded soundtrack its the seventies  we get it already 2 if hes such a phenomenal public speaker why werent we treated to more than a snippet here and there  and even then mostly in montages,negative,0
cactus flower is what i call a pizza movie a personal favorite that never fails to satisfy perfect for an evening at home with a pizza knowing all the lines and what lines by heart only enhances the enjoyment  since so many others here have retold the plot ill simply add the correction that bergmans character miss dickinson was a nursereceptionist meaning she was a skilled nurse and therefore an educated person not just a receptionist  bergmans performance in this film and the film itself was largely dismissed at the time but todays audiences will marvel at her range not just the impeccable comic timing but the ability to make us believe her character is unaware of her own feelings while revealing them so clearly to toni and to us while the general plot stretches credibility bergmans performance is compelling honest and utterly believable  also a standout is jack westons performance as the matthaus old friend and coconspirator harvey no one could deliver a zinger like weston and ial diamonds script gives him plenty for example thats such a big dirty rotten lie it has class weston excelled at slightly seedy characters because he exuded a warmth that allowed you to forgive his characters flaws   the film is a fairly straight adaptation of the abe burrows play which was itself adapted from a french play by barillet and gredy on broadway matthaus role was played by barry nelson bergmans by lauren bacall and hawns by brenda vaccaro it ran for 1234 performances three years and was nominated for two tony awards vaccaro and burt brinckerhoff who played igor  for me the films score written and adapted by the legendary quincy jones is another highlight the main theme a time for love is anytime is performed by sarah vaughn over the opening and closing credits it is also insinuated in different arrangements throughout the film most notably as the romantic piano music underscoring bermans speech to hawn in the record store jones also created covers of popular songs from the period to sir with love im a believer for the night club scenes as with all of the films elements there is a tremendous amount of talent taste and professionalism evident   in my opinion few modern romantic comedies can hold a candle to this classic its great to finally have it available on dvd time to call for a pizza,positive,1
its hard to use words for this movie since it contains none itself  but the images it conveys both powerful and sweeping are ones which remind us why we watch movies and you might be saying well leonard maltin doesnt like it it cant be that good but youre wrong see this movie french cinematic brilliance en ensemble,positive,1
this film was so amateurish i could hardly believe what i was seeing it is shot on video not film i have not seen the likes of this since the early 70s when late night networks showed movie of the week horror flicks shot invideo it looks like a bad soap opera and that is paying it a compliment some of the actors give it their best shot michael des barres does okay with what he is given to do which is to act like a sex addict out of control i cant say that it is pleasant to watch  nastassja kinski as the therapist sits in a chair for practically the entire film with very little variation in camera angles i cant fault her for someone elses poor blocking but she is totally unbelievable in her role her little girl voice works against her here and i consider myself a nastassja kinski fan she is certainly ageless and exotic but shes outside her range with this  alexandra paul is pathetically overwrought every line she delivers is with three exclamation points someone must have directed her to scream at all costs why would michael des barres want to have sex with such a raging shrew  finally rosanna arquette as the sweet maligned wife comes off okay and probably the most believable of the bunch but that is not saying much  this has to be the worst film i have seen in years,negative,0
this unassuming fairly routine series deserves credit in the tv history books for two reasons it was the first to win an emmy award for best syndicated series and it was the very first show to come from the fabled studios of republic pictures known for its lowbudget but highpowered shootemups in the 30s and 40s  republic was one of the first hollywood studios to make a leap into the small screen which was still in its infancy but the studios tenure as producer of tv pulp fiction would be brief after this show they would later dabble with the other format that they were known for the adventure serial with commando cody as well as other series but like this one they didnt last longer than 39 episodes also republic was in its last stages as a studio it would finish out its tenure in hollywood as rental stages for several revue studio series such as soldiers of fortune the original dragnet and kit carson before finally shutting its doors in 1959  anyway stories of the century wasnt that bad of an oater its calling card was tales based on authentic figures in western history mainly outlaws like black bart johnny ringo john wesley hardin the dalton bros and the like the late jim davis best known for his role as the ewing patriarch in dallas put in an amiable job in the lead role as matt clark a fictional railroad detective who has to contend with said outlaws played by veteran and soontobe veteran character actors  two amazing facts here the incidents would take place in different time lines some in the 1880s some at the turn of the century but clark never ages and also matt has the good luck to saddle himself with two lovely female detectives as sidekicks frankie adams played by mary castle and her replacement margaret jonesy jones by kristine miller the lone ranger could only wish for lady companionship you can only spend such time with tonto for so long  stories of the century is a studio city tv production from republic pictures corp 39 episodes were made during 1954 all 39 of which are in public domain and on dvd,positive,1
despite decades of tax incentives in terms of international visibility the canadian film industry still lags behind most central african and islamic states surprisingly few canadian films are released outside their native shores and nouvellefrance aka battle of the brave is another example of why more than any other country commercial canadian cinema seems unable to develop an identity of its own and is stuck in pale imitation of other countries failures on paper this historical drama could look vaguely promising theres certainly a rich vein of untapped material in canadas history as the french and english warred over and bought and sold the colony though none of it makes the cut here unless you count the odd blinkandyoullmissit scene of characters saying wolfe is dead or nouvellefrance is no more before getting back to the soap operatics but while this isnt a history lesson it isnt a drama or the epic adventure the new title promises either there is no battle in the film unless you count 10 seconds of shelling by a halfdozen reenactors and one collapsed shed the town square that is all we ever see of quebec is a rather obvious flatly lit studio interior giving many scenes an old tv miniseries look as does director jean beaudins reluctance to offer much in the way of long shots or even exteriors what you do get for your money is a simple but drawnout harlequin romance about doomed lovers constantly separated by events beyond their control where the biggest surprise is that fabio doesnt turn up in the cast its the kind of film where whenever two characters are about to make the beast with two backs the camera pans over to a convenient raging fireplace or waterfall  an anglocanadianfrench coproduction that doesnt so much unite oncewarring nations as throw any country with a decent tax break into the stew this massive boxoffice disaster was clearly intended to be canadas titanic  though someone neglected to tell the producers they meant the film not the ship  but turns out more like revolution done on the cheap without the battle scenes crowds or the few moments that threaten to briefly work in the face of overwhelming odds the montreal mirror described it as so bad that one cant even find the strength to mock it thats rather unfair because while for most of its running time the film looks like a belowpar 80s miniseries the last half hour suddenly becomes very funny with characters accidentally putting their legs in bear traps dastardly husbands declaring youll never see your handsome lover again cuckolds honor youll pay for this both of you and our heroine accused of murder and  gasp  witchcraft in a trial funny enough to have been in demi moores version of the scarlet letter throw in caddish british governors devious slaves and celine dion singing at the end and youve got something that at times almost feels like the kind of film that timbo hines was aspiring to and still managed to miss wildly with his legendarily inept period version of war of the worlds albeit without the staggering technical incompetence  leading man david la hayes versatility seems limited to the number of other actors he can look like throughout the course of the film he starts out looking like andy garcia briefly adopts the al pacino revolution look flirts with the cleanshaven tchéky karyo style before turning into a younger ted danson as his character ages while his opening scene where he reacts to news of his fathers death with an expression that looks like hes waiting for the director to tell him he can go home now promises a feast of bad acting in reality he gives the impression more of a mediocre supporting actor whos lucked into a lead at the last minute when whoever was originally cast finally read the script and bailed he shows willing and gives it a go but the grace and charisma the part needs just isnt there billie piper lookalike noemie godinvigneaus leading lady doesnt exactly set the screen alight either despite occupying centerstage as the peasant girl who is the prey of giggly vincent perezs corrupt and perverted intendant le bigot that really is the characters name the duplicitous goateed drunken lackey sebastien huberdeau and saddest of all gerard depardieus bedridden revolutionary dirty old priest in a manky greyhaired wig its a truly pitiful sight to see a once great actor at the absolute rock bottom of his game as he shuffles through the motions looking like hes not just lost the will to act but the will to live along with it he clearly couldnt be bothered to stick around for the english dubbing sessions or even a couple of long shots where he is very noticeably doubled small wonder he talked of retiring around the time of the films brief release  some brief comic relief is provided by jason isaacs in his default patriot mode who overplays wolfe of quebec rather like an asthmatic alf garnettarchie bunker played by timothy dalton on speed while tim roths william pitt stands on the sidelines with the occasional bemused smile of one whos being put up in a rather nice hotel with excellent room service and plenty of days off though like colm meaneys benjamin franklin theyre both in the film for less than three minutes voltaire and madame pompadour pop their heads around the door for a couple of minutes as well but fail to make any impression comic or otherwise the supporting actresses are generally better juliette gosselin and bianca gervais as the heroines real and adopted daughters and a strikingly beautiful irene jacob looking for all the world like a young fanny ardant are all refreshingly good and deserve much better,negative,0
hello dave burning paradise is a film for anyone who likes jackie chan and indiana jones the films main protagonist is most definitely the bastard son of these two strange fathers as for the other characters well they are familiar transformations of similar action film stereotypes where this film is original is in the blending of the traditional hong kong movie style with the hollywood action adventure sadly this has not been true of the films he has made in hollywood,positive,1
1933 seemed to be a great year for satires duck soup for instance and this one fits in well even though it is about the obsession with contract bridge the tone is like a humorous piece from the new yorker appropriate since the film begins with the goings on about town page of that magazine the only thing odd is the casting made a few years later william powell and myrna loy would have been perfect however after 1934 you wouldnt have had adultery handled in such a sophisticated fashion the young and beautiful loretta young in some shear and slinky outfits or a group of prostitutes listening to a bridge contest on radio even if you know nothing about bridge you may still want to check out a rare example of hollywood satire,positive,1
what happens when someone has so much social anxiety that they cease to function how alone can one man get when the mundane crap we have to do in order to be part of society gets to be too much what happens frownland explores these questions definitely a startling original debut from bronstein the tone is strange and claustrophobic as we get inside the mind of a guy named keith that is so messed up he can hardly form a proper sentence we follow him around as he tries to make contact with people and function day to day most of us have known people like this people that say sorry too much or i appreciate it when theres nothing to appreciate so we know there are people out there like this but why would someone want to make a movie about them well because its interesting and bronstein and the lead actor dore mann do an excellent job this film is about as uncommercial as a film can get a few friends filmed it over the course of a few years as they saved money it was shot on 16mm and the scratched film look is beautifully low budget with no distributer this may be a tough one to find i think its been screening randomly for the past year or so hopefully itll be on dvd at some point i saw it at the silent movie theater here in la there were 10 people in the audience among them crispin glover if that tells you anything about how weird this movie is highly recommended,positive,1
what seemed as a good premise for a movieunfortunately it fails to deliver on nearly every level very hard to follow at the start of the movie i actually found myself fighting the urge to turn it off the biggest problem from a visual aspect is the fact that the camera work is simply over the top with so many arty splicings and semisubliminal cuts throughout the movie that actually distracts you from the from the overall story it really tries too hard to immerse you in the moment and build to a suspenseful ending but the movie just has so many half conceived characters and non relevant script it just leaves you feeling disappointed and confused as to why they tried to go so deep with it,negative,0
ingrid bergman cleo dulaine has never been so beautiful gary cooper as cleent so perfectly cast as a laconic texan who knows this gal is up to no good when the two lock eyes at the french market we know this match will be full of sparks when they stroll in her garden in her restored french quarter house and the love theme plays it is a dream for all us romantics  the costumes are lovely the set decoration makes you wish the quarter was just that way and that saratoga still had that hotel with the wide veranda with all the old biddies gossiping  from edna ferbers novel the story is of revenge for old wrongs and the fights over who would run the railroads in the early days of that industry  in the saratoga scenes florence bates as a grand dame steals every scene  but it is the scene of cleo taking on the little lawyer her new orleans relatives have sent to buy her off that is a magic movie moment after cleo has bested him in the negotiations he looks at her with longing and says may i say  you are verybeautiful and cleo with a happy wicked smile says yes isnt it lucky you want to shout yes  one of my all time favorite romantic films,positive,1
it is not an easy film to watch  it is over three and a half hours long and it is composed entirely of conversations yet it is so incredibly compelling and ruthlessly observational of the human character that it is in my humble opinion one of the very greatest films of all time  the film is depressing cynical and cruel if you want something uplifting see jacques rivettes fantastic céline and julie go boating which was made around the same time it shows the idealism of the late 1960s to be nothing different from the society that it was trying to change  it involves a supposedly liberated ménageàtrois between alexandre played by jeanpierre leaud marie bernadette lafont and veronika francoise lebrun yet alexandre is shown to be as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man the women are exposed as being willingly subservient and defining their femininity through the male gaze  the film is an extremely icy end to the highly revolutionary french new wave this movement was one of the most significant movements in film history and had a profound effect on cinema as we know it jeanpierre leaud was one of the key actors of the new wave having starred among other films in the influential les quatres cent coups 1959 by francois truffaut as a rebellious teenager director jean eustache is not as well known as other directors from the new wave but he should be  there is no improvisation unlike in john cassavetess similar films made in the us and the dialogue comes from reallife conversations the film is resonant with eustaches personal experiences for example francoise lebrun was a former lover of eustache eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 and the reallife person that the character marie was based on did too the anger and bitterness all culminate in a harrowing monologue by veronika delivered directly to the audience breaking down the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film this mesmerising personal and honest filmic statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature around,positive,1
shore leave is mostly an average star trek adventure nothing wrong with the episode though i simply think that this is not the best representation of what the show had to offer to fans it is lightweight entertaining nothing more however im glad to see that a tv show of this type had enough good sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts in this episode kirk decides to grant his crew some time off and a landing party is beamed down to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation as usual the planet is not as peaceful as it appears to be there are some action and tense moments but most of the story is played for laughs good but unexceptional,positive,1
the 3 stars are for phillip seymour hoffman nothing else and no one else in this movie deserves even a wee smidgen of a star well ok amy adams deserves a wee smidgen but the smidgenometer doesnt seem to be working so ill stick with 3 tom hanksnothing julia robertsnothing mike nicholsdo you see a trend yet aaron sorkinomg not a chance   i could rant on for several paragraphs about the way charlie wilsons war glosses over history morality legitimacy and so on but i dont think any such rant could outweigh the gushing of aaron sorkin fans the rest of you bewarespend your movie money elsewhere  still if youre looking for a pithy comment heres mine you can put hot fudge sauce on a pile of garbage but it changes nothing garbage is garbage and so is charlie wilsons war,negative,0
i can catogoricaly and unequivocally say that in all my 51 years on this planet that is the worse supposibly childrens film i have ever seen in my life  i took my three grand children to see it and even they were struggling to raise a smile during the all tortuous 90 mins the sexual indendoes i will leave for another day but they were as tasteless as the film they should pay you to watch it not you pay them its truly truly awful there is no other way to describe it the people that made this film should be brought to task for taking money under false pretences  aplogise for my spelling mistakes but i am so upset that it spoilt the time i had with my grandchildren regards stephen,negative,0
dear scifi channel how have you been how was your summer ive been ok but i feel like our relationship isnt the same anymore and were growing apart i dont understand why you dont love me anymore ive just finished watching your scifi channel original skeleton man and once again youve shown a blatant lack of respect for my feelings by killing off every hot girl in this movie i mean i understand that youre just in this for instant gratification all you care about is producing a movie where people get sliced and diced by a homicidal indian spiritcreaturelegendwhatever so you really dont have time to put some thought and effort into anything else  like finding a costume for skeleton man that doesnt make him like the gay lover of skeletor from heman seriously his robe looks like a satin blanket sheet and his skull is smooth as a babys behind he almost looks like a killer halloweencostumefora6yearold as he marches through the wilderness on a homicidal rampage so we throw you a bone because were not looking for oscarwinning performances intriguing plot or realistic character reactions to the situations at hand because we realize that even though michael rooker caspar van diem and all the girls are supposed to be trained special ops agents they are all mysteriously transformed into keystone kops who cant shoot or see straight whenever skeleton man appears and we also fully expect that nothing  bullets explosions electrocution nothing  can kill skeleton man until there is one minute left in the movie and we need to find a way to tie things up neatly we expect to see blood and guts but you have a knack for taking the least attractive actress in the entire cast and making her the only female who survives and quite honestly i think you do it just to antagonize me because this movie as silly as it is has the potential to be a sobaditsgood classic and just killing off all the hotties ruins everything  and forces me to lower its rating all i ask is that once just once you take my feelings into account and let the sexiest girls survive the movie please,negative,0
i have been watching this movie repeatedly since it came out even though it is 8 years old now it still cracks me up the jokes are still hilarious and the way the characters are portrayed will make anybody of any age laugh like theyve never laughed before enjoy it,positive,1
i watched dvd 1 only the program proper may have 10 minutes of good information otherwise its snotty putdowns of religious people its as if director brian flemming only recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm and feels with these tools he can easily bludgeon his opposition  also flemming wanders extensively into his own personal issues and they take over the movie it never gets back on topic  religious people are prone to discount skeptics when their objections to religion are obviously rooted in abusive upbringings arguments from such victimized people seem irrational and therefore unconvincing  antireligious people will want more data we dont need to be told that religious people are nutty any more than american jews need to be told how annoying christmas music gets by middecember  in the best scene the superintendent of flemings childhood christian school rather insightfully confronts the director on his motivations that seems like the most honest part of the movie and it was too short  if fleming were a bit more selfaware he might have a good story in him about his own past  current relationship to christianity and the abusive institutions that indoctrinated him in his youth  and perhaps he could lend his christ never walked the earth material to a more serious documentarian im not studying the writings of saulpaul to find out how airtight this all is but a quick browse of wikipedia suggests most of these arguments are discredited  the bonus interviews are pretty good tho they dont bolster flemings thesis much sam harris is a good spokesperson for the antireligious pov and he doesnt go light on those other nonchristian religions harris also has some good and easily googled interviews on saloncom  amazoncom  and samharrisorg ,negative,0

did the first travesty actually make money this is another sequel along the lines of another stakeout that no one asked for but weve received it anyway the sequel is like its predecessor completely braindead its also pretty disgusting remember the dinner scene to think i almost felt sorry for ritter yasbeck and warden did they need the money that much,negative,0
sammy horn michael des barres is the head chef and owner of a famous restaurant in california he has a lovely wife grace horn rosanna arquette who is pregnant and a beautiful son of about five years old sammy indeed loves his family but like dr jeckyll and mr hyde he has a double life having sex with many different women dr jane bordeaux nastassja kinski is trying to help him ok it is my fault i read the summary of the other imdb user comments i saw the imdb user rating but i really did not believe that rosanna arquette and nastassja kinski could participate in such a bad movie i decided to check it and actually some comments are very complacent the storyline the screenplay and the dialogs are so silly and laughable that even in some xrated movies we can find more intelligent stories the photography is so amateurish and naive that in some parts it seems to be taken through a vhs camcorder michael des barres does not have sense of ridiculous being an old man bald would be acceptable in an advertisement of viagra or grandfather of the small boy but as an attractive man who gets and has sex with any woman it is scary in wood allens comedy maybe he got a chance but in a serious movie it is funny i am trying to figure out why or how rosanna arquette and nastassja kinski accepted to participate in such awful amateurish and trash movie do they need money lack of chances in better movies due to their ages are they friends of the director sorry for using this word and decided to help and promote him i do not know whether the intention of rosanna arquette was to show her breasts full of silicone but it is unacceptable that such a great actress accepts such a script the same is applicable to the gorgeous nastassja kinki she is presented fat without makeup without any glamour a total lack of respect with one of the most beautiful actress in the cinema history a fact is really intriguing me how can a reader without any personal interest promote this trash giving higher ratings or writing favorable comments about this movie are they friends of the director again i am using this word or the cast it sounds very strange to me that a normal imdb reader can like such a film my vote is two  title brazil viciado em sexo addicted in sex,negative,0

the screaming skull opens with a warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it  now theres a hook the story itself has a fairly interesting premise for a horror flick scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness then attempts to convince her that shes going insane with shrill noises mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at inopportune times add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the mans first wife who he was devoted to maybe its just that the 1950s didnt have the technology to pull off some of the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie the techniques used here seem contrived and mundane but then again when i first saw house on haunted hill as a nine year old it gave me the heebie jeebies in the same way im sure this film did for young viewers of the same era  dont get me wrong the film is not terrible it just seems to get tedious at times but theres some great atmospheric tension in the generally huge but unfurnished whitlock home and the gardens and pool are a nice touch for me the best played out scene involves eric whitlock john hudson going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull he just wades right in clothes and all in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener director alex nicol in a dual role it makes you wonder who the real dimwit was  in its own good way perhaps the most shocking thing about the film how about that neat roadster the whitlocks make their first appearance in  gull wing doors in 1958 that at least made me jump out of my seat,negative,0
i own ralph bakshis forgotten masterpiece fire  ice on an old oop rental videotape   well for one thing this is better than any other conanesque film youll ever see sure its cheesy but who cares it stood the test of time and the only way it started to look cheesy is in comparisons to modern fantasy epics like lotrfotr though i love that film   the plot goes like this after a battle between fire  ice a kings daughter is kidnapped by jarols ice subhuman creatures while a sole survivor of a victimized village rescues her   yeah it doesnt sound as a original as nurse betty but thats not the point it is really to bring to life an interesting idea of a world of two enemies fire  ice and it succeeds   as for the action scenes superb they are well handled have terrific suspence and have plenty of loud noises just check out the climatic battle now thats an ending   the acting and dialogue competent really they arent gonna be nominated for an oscar but they are ok and dont get on your nerves   the animation is quite good shot on 3d and rotoscoped i think it looks pretty good a lot of the backgrounds look really detailed and well drawn and although the character designs feel a little 1dimentional they are ok   overall this is a fine neglected little gem and will entertain you more than any of the superfical entertainment 1010,positive,1
ive never seen the original movie others have commented on so my perspective is just about this movie without comparison  i found the message of the movie to be if you only worry about yourself all will be right with the world everything will fall into place your lovers will love you more your friends will respect and like you more your employers will want you more pay you more and even your own children and parents will love you more  i find this message to be reprehensible and totally false  kudos for the very funny birthing scene at the end there isnt a mother out there who wont laugh during that scene  overall a very disappointing movie plot i didnt find myself rooting for anyone in this movie i thought they were all pathetic self absorbed individuals that i just didnt care what happened to them and thats not a movie people want to see,negative,0
i thought they should have called this movie whites instead of heights godawfulthe kind of film that makes people hate new yorkers people who are so self obsessed and think their lives are so importantgive me a break such a lily white cast that glenn close was the most ethnic character in it this film was crying out for someone real to come in and steal itand so they introduce get this a character even whiter than the rest of the cast i thought he was an albino at firstwhos supposed to be welshim still trying to decipher that accent intellectually dishonestthis movie is the kind of film thats able to fool so many people into thinking its worthwhile because it has the trappings of something more ambitious better to fill the theaters with mi510 than with this pretentious crapmust have been a better play because you cant fall off the floor,negative,0
minor spoilers as a bad movie connoisseur i must have viewed hundreds of bad movies and yet hobgoblins stands apart from all others in its own unique way classic baddies such as the creeping terror the mighty gorga and manos are uniformly bad from start to finish hobgoblins on the other hand starts off bad and gets progressively worse as it goes during my first viewing of the infamous rake fight scene i thought to myself that this was a truly bad film i was blissfully unaware that i had just seen the best that this movie had to offer the movie takes its most massive nosedive into celluloid hell during the painfully inept club scum sequence which is a continuous string of one unfunny joke after another with just this one film director rick sloane proves that he deserves mention alongside the likes of coleman francis and bill rebane as one of the worst directors of all time how bad can a bad movie be watch hobgoblins and wonder no longer,negative,0
this is simply another bad chuck norris movie norris plays a cop on the trail of a twisted serial killer of women he put the guy away three years before but the guy somehow gets through the bars in the nut house hes in by using what looks like dental floss then the killer escapes in a cleaning van and drives it over a 400 foot cliff and survives to spend time around a theater undergoing renovation irish jack ohalloran is the best thing in this movie but like in superman ii he doesnt say a word somehow thats supposed to make him more menacing ron oneal of super fly fame and steve james are wasted playing the citys mayor and norris sidekick respectively the film also contains the idiotic subplot of norris and his girlfriend having a child out of wedlock its so 1980s when coupling norris serious acting turn with overthetop musical cues signaling every forthcoming scene in predictable fashion the film becomes a chore to sit through the buildup while searching for the killer in the theater is interesting enough with norris crawling through the shadows to discover the hideaway but the end fight is disappointing after beginning in such a promising way its yet another disappointment from cannon films and it plays like a movie made for television  of 4 stars,negative,0

please make me forget please please this is the worst film i have ever had the misfortune to watch i consider the film an insult to my brain as well as my backside who both have suffered from me sitting and watching this film i have yet to see what damage it has caused my sight and my ability to complete sentences what a load of garbage and dont get me started about the acting someone please help me forget weird science  come back everything is forgiven  i am proud to give this film the first 1 here at imdb and ive voted for hundreds of films many of them cp but this is so bad i cant even believe it someone actually came up with the idea and thought it was worthy of becoming a film someone actually read the script and decided to produce the film someone read the script and auditioned for it someone saw the film and decided not to put it on a shelf to collect dust for eternity these are the questions i want answers to not the philosophical question about that tree in the woods and well you know,negative,0
my god this movie was awful i cant complain about it too much i went to see it just to be grossed out it did suffice sort of its funny that the most disgusting part of the movie was in the very very beginning where the woman is extremely vividly forced to give birth to a horribly mutated baby  i also think that its funny that the most notable actor in the movie was the hispanic soldier who was a supporting actor in next friday everyone in the movie did a horrible acting job it was some of the worst acting ive ever paid to see   i also expected that it would be much more gruesome than the first one it wasnt i expected it to be more gruesome because its a sequel and horror movie sequels are usually much less successful than their predecessors i expected it to be more gruesome since gore and violence usually sell a horror movie these days grudge 2 saw 3 jeepers creepers 1  2 dead silence but it actually wasnt nearly as gruesome as the first one which was yet another disappointment   the mutants in the first one were kind of disturbing but the filmmakers were trying so hard in this one to make them creepy that they were absolutely hilarious  i also hated the entire concept of showing the clip of the female soldiers son on her cameraphone saying i love you mommy four times it was stupid to show it in the first place because they were just trying to make us feel worse for the vulnerable mother than the rest of the soldiers and it was even more stupid to keep trying to make us feel even worse for her by showing it three more times for no reason this movie was a joke,negative,0

unlike other commenters who have commented on this movies ability to transcend race contrarily i think that this powerful film provides a complex and deep story that addresses institutional racism and the effects thereof washington directs fishers story with a careful hand and critical eye relinquishing this cinematic endeavor neither to dismemberment of womens bodies perpetuating unthoughtful stereotypes nor satisfying the expectation of the white gaze i think this film might be a bit too happy in the end however it is deeply entrenched in afroamerican culture and discourse to the point that some white spectators may get the feeling of looking into the life of this afroamericanantwone fisher i have problems with the naval aspect of the film but when we look at america there are not many choices or opportunities for black men who arewere in fishers situation or similar situations viewers may go to this movie expecting a black movie what is a black movie  do stereotypes of pimps whores drug dealers single parent homes and so forth constitute a black movie i think washington as director recognized that afroamericans and other people of color deal with human problems like abuse and displaced aggression to name a few these problems havehistorically and presentlyonly been given light and validity via good will hunting and other white movies its high time they were given the same recognition and validity as their white counterparts in and out of the media  sad to say though in this racist country denzel washington and derek luke will probably have to wait another ten years before they receive an oscar or anything else they both will have to wait until they direct or star in a movie that perpetuates the usual racist and sexist stereotypes to get an oscar that is to say denzel deserved awards for malcolm x hurricane and others before that jive training day oscar that is not to negate or push aside other great actresses and actors of color who are denied their due praise for ingenious work yet hollywood would rather send the message that racism and sexism and heterosexism are acceptable by perpetuating and even rewarding those stereotypes as they appear in countless films such as american beauty midnight in the garden of good and evil american pie and even gone with the wind  derek luke is a helluva actor and i wish him best all of the other actresses and actors gave superb performances hands down although i do take issue with denzels selection of yet another straighthaired lightskinned sistuh that said everyone should watch this film however it may not be for everyone much luv 1010,positive,1
we all knew even before it aired the ron moore miniseries is no battlestar galactica thats fine it just means it must stand on its own it cant lean on battlestar galactica if its any good its good on its own merits and ron moore has something to be proud of if reports are true this is what moore wanted however if his miniseries rots he has shamed all the excellent actors that performed onscreen not to mention the myriad offscreen personnel and this is what hes done  yes this miniseries is no remake i wouldnt even call it a reimagining its a new production inspired by battlestar galactica it does not take place in the galactica universe with the same places and jargon and technology it doesnt tell of the galacticas search for the thirteenth tribe nor does it rely on the legends and mysteries that underpinned galactica ron moores miniseries is a spaceopera action flick with a ceremonial nod to battlestar galactica  maybe i should say just another spaceopera action flick because as plots go his has little thats original or even interesting i could relay the whole thing to you without a spoiler warning but i wont inflict that on you ill just hit the most important point ready now here it is just watch the trailer it will tell you everything there is in the story  yes creations of man turn on man and seek to destroy man i guess they forgot azimovs rules again they look like humans so theres the whole aliensamongus thing at least theres no timetravel oh and lots of fighting scenes and random acts of sex and violence the end result was that when moore did draw from galactica that ceremonial nod it came off more corny than respectful i mean couldnt he even think up anything of his own  from the first few minutes i wanted to watch something else i didnt care about any of moores characters since i couldnt identify with any of them this fact hit me in the face when the cylons began their attack armageddon on a planetary scale and i didnt give a damn how depressing  moores heroes when faced with an insurmountable obstacle instead of overcoming it rather tucked tail and saved their own butts after all it was the only way to save humanity yadda yadda yadda they took the safe way out rather than risking their own lives to defend others at least disgust is not apathy  but in the end the ron moore miniseries was just activity without purpose a movie on a treadmill forever running yet going nowhere and i just wanted it to be over and by the time it was over my lifeforce had been sucked from me against my own will i was turning into a mindless soulless zombie probably of the type to which this miniseries would appeal i needed to replenish myself i needed toand i swear this is truei needed to watch an episode of babylon 5 two episodes in fact and i felt much better and happier,negative,0
adrian has just gone out of the asylum being rich and with no parents his life seems empty one day he meets gonzalo a poor boy whom mother is prostitute desperate for earning some money gonzalo helps adrian to search about his life and who where his parents this is a movie from a new director and it is perfectly clear in most of the film scenes not correctly directed dialogues a little forced some incoherences in the scriptanyway the ending is unexpectedly well done well just a little and that saves a little the film actors are known and with great quality nevertheless they are not inspired enough to make the movie interesting all of them have done better papers in other film the film results boring and probably you will spend most of the time thinking how much time will pass until it ends of course there are lots of worse films but sure there are many many better ones,negative,0
spike lee has to be one of the most over rated directors i have ever seen he is the critics darling because he supposedly makes films with a message or he is just so bohemian in his approach that it makes critics that are waterlogged from formula hollywood films eat his stuff up just for being different  summer of sam does not even do that well the cinematography and editing style is oliver stone and so is the narrative the plot is a lot like do the right thing the portrayal of guidos or for the pc set italianamericans of which i happen to be one is straight out of eddie murphys raw only eddie murphys impression of a macho italian guy picking a fight with a much taller africanamerican is much much more believable than the cartoonish broad italian caricatures shown here the john leguizamo character being a possible exception  is there anybody who saw this movie that could not figure out how it was going to end up as soon as richie came into the film i could already see the fist in his face and the foot in his stomach i could already see him being accused of being the killer this character had the most integrity in the whole film so of course lee is going to show what happens to people that stand out in a crowd what a white bearded clique  someone please please give spike lee a lifetime pass to all the basketball games he wants so maybe he will be enjoying himself too much to pick up a film camera for a long time and we wont have to be subjected to his self important drivel and furthermore i wont have to see critics some of them whom i respect ohhhh and ahhhh to an emperor with no clothes,negative,0
the actors were not believable the story was really weak total sap and completely predictable really disappointed in depardieu it was a shame that they did not focus more on the struggle of the canadian fight for independence we have seen this love story many times before only with better actors we had to wait for the last 15 minutes for a small sense of drama the soundtrack was totally disturbing the underscore hit you over the head with sentimentality but really over the top the only thing we found ok was the fact that they let the indians speak their language and we found the cinematography of the indian village relatively realistic,negative,0
please save your money and go see something else this movie was such piece of crap i didnt want to go but i had to so i thought id laugh at least once nope not a single laugh it was that horrible chris kattan will never get a good comedy role after this and a night at the roxbury this movie is completely obvious has no smart humor at all and just repeats itself over and over again listen to me and stray as far away from this movie as you possibly can,negative,0
i never really watched this program before although it came highly recommended by members of my family funnily enough my girlfriend lives in hadfield the filming location and she pointed out a few landmarks when i first visited  this got my interest going so i bought the 1st series on video and sat down to watch besides recognising some of the locations i found myself not in the least bit surprised once again the bbc were responsible for producing another example of the finest comedy in the world tlog easily ranks up there with red dwarf fawlty towers and monty python as probably the best  suffice to say i am hooked on the program now the characters are superb and show unusual depth while retaining a scarily realistic edge the look and feel of the program is perfect and reflects the sometimes bleak feeling of the north no disrespect to hadfield which i have found a very welcoming and warm place  i only hope that it continues its originality throughout its run which based upon the 2nd series which concluded its rerun in the uk last night it certainly is  well done the bbc,positive,1
i own a copy of this film and have always loved it i comment here however because i saw the pbs presentation of a concert version of sweeney todd earlier this week that production was put on by the san francisco opera and starred george hearn and patti lupone in the early 80s hearn replaced len cariou as sweeney cariou had won the tony for his performance i saw hearn and angela lansbury who also won the tony for her performance as mrs lovett perform sweeney on broadway they must have made the film at about the time i saw the show to this day the most moving moment i can ever remember in the theatre occurred when hearn sang these are my friends these are my friends see how they glisten my arm is complete again   hearns performance in the san francisco opera production convinced me that he has lost nothing in the nearly twenty years since i first saw him perform the piece on broadway and later in the film what a talent he is sympathetic funny and scary  all at once and he can sing boy can he sing all of this reminded me of how terrific the film is highly recommended ten out of ten,positive,1
i hadnt seen this in many years the acting was so good as i began this time i thought great another movie i misjudged as a foolish young man but then the theme started to be clear and i felt the same way  this was hollywood the seat of glamor so the concept shouldnt be a surprise but it is so condescending a concept i feel as if i need to take a shower after watching it in brief it tells us that even physically ugly people can seem beautiful to each other and even feel attractive  dorothy mcguire is likable as the homely heroine she seems to have been filmed wearing minimal makeup robert young is injured in the war and feels scarred his parents cant bear to look at him either he seems to have all his faculties and in part the notions of disability are outmoded  herbert marshall is on hand as a blind pianist his character speaks is hushed tones and is omniscient  the best performance is given by mildred natwick as the owner of the title residence she is bitter and dour but not made of ice her story is much more interesting and believable than that of mcguire and young,negative,0
this movie was an amazing tribute to whoever has gone through this type of pain and suffering the acting wasnt the greatest ill admit that but it was passionate about its message sending people into prisons without so much as an attorney or some type of trial is cruel and unusual they even had a damn trial for saddam so why doesnt every suspected terrorist have some type of fair and justified trial or hearing as to why they were tagged in the first place im getting off the movie but i think its worthy to note about this sick twisted idea the government has the movies way of telling the story and the backstory was a great mystery the whole movie i was trying to connect the daughter with the plot and its made very obvious in the end theres no doubt that the directing was incredible but the one thing i didnt care for was that there wasnt as much emphasis on reese witherspoons characters interest and fight in the ideal she held a lot of skipping otherwise it was actually quite entertaining and most of all it kept my attention and interest for the two hours it played,positive,1
return to cabin by the lake just was lacking it must have had a very low budget because a fair amount of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera so within the same scene  youll have some moviequality camera shots and simple video camera shots it makes for a very odd blend i think they should have found some way to not do the home video type effect   i think its worthwhile to see it if you have seen the original cbtl because then you can compare and see the differences but if you havent seen the original cbtl youll never want to see it if you see this one first it will probably seem way too cheesy and turn you off from even caring about the original one,negative,0
a remake of a successful movie can be a tricky business at best to remake a true classic especially one that is veritably the definitive film of a director like alfred hitchcock is something else again and after watching this version of psycho directed by gus van sant two things come to mind immediately whats the point and what on earth were they thinking especially in light of the fact that van sant used the same screenplay by joseph stefano taken from the novel by robert bloch that hitchcock used the final result here underscores some of the finer points of the art of filmmaking first that a remake should be just that a retooling of the original rather than a copy using new players and second that shooting in color using more blood and being a bit more graphic does little more than detract from the impact of the film although this was a noble effort by van sant ironically in the end it suffers from the same flaw with which norma bates was afflicted the mind of the film was divided half was hitchcock half van sant and the twain though met shall never be bound van sant even working from the original script would have been better off making his own film all the way through rather than attempting to duplicate exactly what hitchcock did with certain scenes the opening shot of the movie for instance and especially the shower scene arguably one of the most famous scenes in the history of the cinema copying hitchcock from the shots looking directly into the shower head to the one of the drain and using the same skree skree skree sound effects even as homage to hitchcock again only distracted from the story and if you factor in the performance of william h macy as private eye arbogast you have yet another split in the psyche of the film macy is a terrific actor one of the best character actors in the business and his performance here is excellent but as good as it is the attitude and delivery are pure david mamet with whom he has worked many times and seemingly out of context with what van sant is doing so the film winds up with a triple personality disorder hitchcock van sant and mamet i felt like i was watching house of good will psycho games   	as far as performances go macys was as solid as they come and anne heche marion crane did a good job of creating an original character escaping the trap of attempting an imitation of janet leigh the weak links were viggo mortensen sam who made marions boyfriend so smarmy and unappealing it made you wonder why she had anything to do with him in the first place and vince vaughn whoto put it as delicately as possible was simply awful as norman bates his whole performance was that of an actor playing a role and not very convincingly at that affecting effeminate mannerisms and punctuating his speech with spontaneous bursts of maniacal laughter made his norman more of a caricature than a character altogether unbelievable and pretentious it gave the movie the feel of a reenactment of a true incident you would see on a television show it would have been entirely in keeping with the sensibility of the film to cut away from norman sitting alone in his parlor to a shot of a soberfaced peter graves intoning such was the mindset of norman bates on that fateful rainy night when marion crane stepped out of her car and into his life the supporting cast includes julianne moore lila robert forster dr simon philip baker hall sheriff al chambers anne haney mrs chambers chad everett tom cassidy rance howard mr lowery rita wilson caroline james remar patrolman and james legros charlie the car dealer if nothing else van sants psycho is a curiosity that goes to show that having a good director a predominantly excellent cast and a script that is a proven commodity does not necessarily insure a success granted todays era of psychobabble american psycho and hannibal lecter have effectively taken the edge off of a character like norman bates somewhat but there is still a singular intimacy in this particular story of the relationship between norman his mother and his victims that will forever remain inherently disturbing and terrifying but van sant is unable to convey that sense of dread that throatclenching fear with this film if ever there was a movie made that should have been earmarked straighttovideo this is it better still had it never been born i rate this one 210,negative,0

i agree with another user here and have to say that this is one of the best kung fu movies ever i watched this as a kid and absolutely loved it the scaffolding scenes are brilliant and you can really empathise with this guy because he is treated as an outcast nice humour and fantastic kung fu this movie rocks if you like kung fu you would love this,positive,1

theres nothing really to dislike about the odd couple and its no surprise that jack lemmon and walter matthau make a hugely winning comedic team but theres something so underdeveloped about neil simons adaptation of his hit stage play as to make it seem more like a skit on a sketch comedy show than a fullbodied film i have not seen the play but have to assume that the screen version is fairly faithful since simon wrote it so the defects cannot be blamed on a stagetoscreen adaptation there are some interesting ideas in this storytwo recently divorced men who fall immediately into traditional married roles when they become roommates because neither knows any differentlythat simon never fully fleshes out still there are many worse ways to kill a couple of hours,positive,1
this has to be one of the best if not the best film i have seen for a very very long time had enough action to satisfy an fan and yet the plot was very good i really enjoyed the filmand had me hooked from start to finish  added blood and gore in there but brought the realistic nature of what happens to the front of the film and even had a tear jerker ending for many people i should think  it is a must watch for anyone seen many reviews slating the film but to be fair most the films that get bad reviews turn out to be some of the best this proves it once again  rent this film buy this film just go out and watch this film you will not be disappointed,positive,1
i rented this film to see what might be a bloody non stop action movie and got this overly sentimental and super cheap low budget actiondrama that makes kickboxer look like die hard lou and reb are in vietnam and as lou saves reb from the gooks he gets shot in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects ever the vietnam scenes are shot in someones backyard i swear lou is now brain damaged and reb and him live together and own a bar super homoerotic lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money and reb goes on a killing spree to get him back there is no good fight scenes at all the punches are two inches away from a person characters personalities change in matter of seconds one guy is a bad and in the next scene hes good the acting is horrid and the music is some overly sentimental frank stallone sounding song that would make you sick i hated this film,negative,0
the main problem of the first vampires movie is that none of the characters were sympathetic carpenter learned from his mistake and this time used a likable vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire the female vampire una certainly is the coolest vampire since blades deacon frost unfortunately while there are some good concepts like a cool slow motion restaurant scene why didnt carpenter use more of this this movie is nowhere near as good as it could have been i expected to see strong vampires in action and at least one longer lasting nicely choreographed fight sequence for example inside a city and was left somewhat disappointed while los muertos proceeds at a faster pace than its predecessor it still drags a little in some parts though nowhere near as bad as vampires did much like vampires however this movies climax near the end is not very intense  most of the above may sound like los muertos is a bad movie but it definitely isnt it is generally enjoyable and ranks among the better entries to the genre it is neither an unoriginal dracula remake like almost every other vampire movie out there nor is it an unintelligent action spectacle like blade ii it simply could have used a bit more excitement  id really like to see a third installment made by carpenter but its probably not going to happen  spoiler warning the ending was way too predictable una should have gotten away that would have made the movie quite unusual,positive,1
first off i have to say acting isnt very good miranda cosgrove is the main character but is not such a good actress quite frankly spencer her brother is a way much better actor spencer is easily my favorite character because he probably is the only one that knows how to act carly on the other hand tries to act her heart out but sorry it just isnt good sam doesnt even get credit i mean come on icarly pretty self centered eh freddy isnt bad i dont have a comment i must add that carly and her puppet sam change their attitude whenever they go to film a web cast they go shouting out all their linesits sorta bad influence in a way because carly has a web show and if kids will copy this they might be giving their own information and that not pretty safe  the only nice things is that it has some funny parts of the show which makes it entertaining at least this show isnt boring it has nice plots pretty strong many kids will like this because they dont look for flaws  overall this is a bad show but its not boring,negative,0
when alfred hitchcock made strangers on a train it was a harbinger for the bulk of the film going public that he was back at the top of his form from 1946 to 1950 his films were not box office successes and his contractual arrangement with david o selznick ended because of this actually he made some really good films in the period such as notorious spellbound under capricorn rope and my opinion stagestruck but while notorious and spellbound were liked the audiences were turned off by hitchs attempts at experimentation his use of a dream sequence by salvator dali in spellbound was acceptable as was the setting among psychiatrists but the experiment with long takes in rope confused the public making ignore the merits of that film and the willingness of hitch to have the audience fooled by a lie told by a leading character in a flashback was disliked  far more disliked then it deserved to be  in stagestruck a matter of bad timing for under capricorn it was released just as the scandal of its star ingrid bergman and roberto rosallini broke out made it seem to be a failure which it wasnt the paradine case was another failure  and one that really had little in its favor  with strangers on a train hitchcock shied away from the special tricks that interested him in the recent films instead he concentrated on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity based on a novel by patricia highsmith the story was of how guy haines a professional tennis player meets a fan of his  bruno anthony a playboy  who is traveling on a crosscountry train at the same time as the athlete bruno is talkative and fawning and guy views him as one of the typical fans he has metif a little eccentric with his talk of wanting to be on the first rocket to outer space but bruno knows all about guys personal problems he is married to a promiscuous young woman named miriam and is in love with anne morton daughter of a senator bruno knows that miriam wont divorce her successful celebrity husband bruno mentions how he can sympathize  he hates his stepfather who is constantly criticizing him then bruno mentions sort of off the cuff an idea he has about two men  technically strangers  exchanging murders for each other and then committing two perfect unsolvable crimes instead of fumbling them guy listens to the idea  and agrees it is an interesting idea the train reaches guys destination and his last comment is like a validation of the idea he just does not realize that the eccentric bruno is a sociopath and believes guy has just agreed to the two killing each others foe  its a wonderfully simple plot actually bruno of course does kill miriam but he fully expects guy to live up to the murder agreement and kill his stepfather guy is horrified  and worse he finds that he is the police departments number one suspect when bruno to encourage guy mentions he has the latters lighter he pocketed it on the train and can plant it at the murder site guy finds himself in deeper problems  how to avoid the police and how to control if possible the insane bruno  hitch always planned the shots of his film carefully so that from the start we see both our heroes from their feet heading towards their fateful meeting in the train with each other there are constant crosscontacts used in the film to show how the two men are drawn into each others orbits it is like fate drawing them together yet both have their own personality  and hitch with a typical twist makes the mad bruno actually more of an attractive figure his scheme may be vicious it will kill two people if successful and he will have guy live up to the agreement no matter what but he has a zest for life one suspects that once guy too had one but his marriages failure coupled with his now dating a socially prominent woman has made him more circumspect and dull than he was  the cast is good too robert walker probably had his finest role in this film only a year before his death it was a far cry from the homespun boynextdoor of since you went away or the clock his lithe figure also looked quite elegant in tales in several scenes as guy farley granger acts like a cousin of his comurderer in rope especially as the circumstances make him increasingly suspicious to the authorities as his earlier role made his jittery behavior increasingly suspicion to jimmy stewart as for the ladies kasie rogers is properly sluttish as miriam  enabling the audience to be prepared for her demise in a famous sequence shot in the reflection of her eyeglasses so that they actually are cheering bruno in his act of evil patricia hitchcock appears as the younger sister of anne ruth roman who bears a close resemblance to miriam and accidentally sets off bruno at a social occasion she plays this rare role well ruth roman is properly supportive of granger but her role is limiting because she is establishment in her background and somewhat low keyed other supporting performers leo g caroll as the senator marion lorne usually a comedian as brunos dotty mother and norma varden as an unexpected recipient of violence from walker are all shown to best advantage  all at the hand of a master,positive,1
reba sucks it sucks hard its about this awful country singer attempting comedy they might as well call this show generic because thats what it is its dumb and generic reba youre not funny and im glad your retarded show was cancelled because you suck and so does brock barbra jean the redheaded teenager that jockey guy and the 12 year old who got knocked up you all suck and none of you are funny oh and i heard a rumor that reba is actually a gay devilworshipper who idolizes hitler and tortures animals and she puts subliminal messages on her show and in her music in hopes to make children kill their parents and kill themselves but it was just a rumor anyway this is the worst show ever reba is gay i do not like her i think the office is better than this show and this show sucks,negative,0
in my opinion the ending is what completely ruined the whole thing the initial idea of having someone suddenly realize they were the son of god and the second coming was somewhat clever people started to believe him and his friends became the new disciples people went nutty demons were possessing people all kinds of fun of course then it all went wrong it was bad enough that they had to take on the impossible task of looking through a vast amount of writings to find the third testament in five days but then at the end it became this ridiculous humanist fantasy i wont spoil it but ill just say it comes off as if it were written by a teenager with a very limited knowledge of theology i hear they are making an american feature version of this story i just hope they change the eye rolling ending,negative,0
ive received this movie from a cousin in norway and had to convert it from norwegian to american format with a copied video comparing this film 1948 with the heroes of telemark 1965 kampen om tungtvannet the struggle for the heavy water casts the saboteurs themselves playing their respective roles though actors were also cast to play the roles of the saboteurs who have given their lives in norways struggle for freedom in later campaigns the plot is in four languages norwegian along with french german and english complete with norwegian subtitles  impressive during this course of history was what led to the struggle french scientists were interested in obtaining some two hundred kilograms of heavy water from norsk hydro in vemork to take back to france in order to do lab studies on its effectiveness simultaneously the nazis too were interested in obtaining heavy water to build a secret weapon the french were worried that the nazis might take an early lead by invading norway and through secret codes their man carefully eluded nazi spies on his trip to oslo where he received the heavy water and making it back without hindrance he was watched by two spies as he boarded an airliner but they did not see him hop out on the other side where he crossed the tarmac to another plane nearby where his cargo was waiting for him this clever trick worked by using the airliner as a decoy that the nazis later forced down in hamburg  however the invasion of norway on the morning of april 9 1940 the nazis took over norsk hydro and it was up to the norwegian underground and british intelligence in london to take action professor leif trondstad volunteered the services of eleven young norwegians the swallow and gunnerside groups who would successfully sabotage the heavy water production in vemork this was shown in detail on how they actually carried out the operation including the sinking of the ferryboat after the nazis abandoned norsk hydro to take the shipment of heavy water on rail cars to berlin  the quality of the film was fair though there were many splices in the film i highly recommend this film to anyone interested in world war ii history,positive,1

this dvd usually sells for around 20 i wouldnt pay this much for the dvd if i had known what i was getting but regardless this is a pretty good disc it displays the knot in all their glory with footage from their concerts playing surfacing wait and bleed and scissors among other tracks including the spit it out music video which was apparently banned from mtv  slipknot for those who dont know is essentially a symphony of the damned nine masked men who display total chaos on stage with machine gun drums squealing guitar and vocals that will tear your face off and leave you wanting more for those whove never seen slipknot before i cannot recommend enough you get this dvd probably off ebay or amazon so you can get a better deal  a short though well made show of the knot  seven out of ten,positive,1
i thought the movie i do they dont was fantastic in the past ive watched rob estes on suddenly susan  melrose place and also josie bissett on melrose place and loved seeing them together again in i do they dont they have great chemistry together i guess being married in real life helps that  in the movie they are both widowed with children and careers and they fall in love and try blend their already busy chaotic families together without dropping the ball of course they stumble but they keep it together which is what working and raising a family is all about so many people have been talking about this movie  all good  and the movie left us wanting more this would make a great series  appealing to many ages  it would be so nice to see a real life down to earth family show like this that portrays the reality of so many of our lives today  instead of the so called reality tv that all the stations are overwhelming us with these days someone tell the people at abc family they have the start of a new series here,positive,1

1st watched 12262008 direugene levy corny comedy murder mystery with very few laughs the movie appears to be based on an earlier italian movie according to the credits but was rewritten by two fairly popular american romantic comedy writers but this one by charles shyer  nancy meyers does not cut it compared to their other efforts the story is about a couple of downandout traveling americans played by richard lewis and sean young who stumble upon a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing an ad in the paper for the dachsunds return upon trying to return it they see a hand sticking out of a garage door at the ladys residence that they believe is attached to the rest of the dead body of the woman who is supposed to give them the money they freak out and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth they make out like runaways from the scene expecting to be framed for the murder the other characters in the film are met on a train prior to this and hang around a monte carlo gambling resort doing various things to be pulled into the story the other cast members include character actors john candy james belushi cybill shepherd george hamilton and others after the police find out about the death they start questioning the main characters and of course they have to work thru their goofy lies to figure out what really happened none of the character actors mentioned earlier can bring this movie out of its mediocre state despite some funny moments mostly provided by the belushishepherd couple this isnt a horrible movie it just isnt that good there are plenty of average movies out there and this is just another one for the pile try it maybe youll like it probably you wont,negative,0
if you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film i would have told you it was great however i left the theatre feeling unsatisfied after thinking a little about it i believe the problem was the pace of the ending i feel that the majority of the movie moved kind of slow and then the ending developed very fast so i would say the ending left me disappointed  i thought that the characters were well developed costner and kutcher both portrayed their roles very well yes ashton kutcher can act also the different relationships between the characters seemed very real furthermorei thought that the different plot lines were well developed overall it was a good movie and i would recommend seeing it  in conclusion good characters great plot poorly writtenedited ending still go see it,positive,1
well they sent it on tv between midnight and 200 am  it seems like the right time to watch it and then go to bed afterwards   no it was not really living up to my expectations i think the dogma concept is good because the film then gets closer to whats really happening between the involved characters when you cut all the unnecessary effects and moodmaking music out but then again this concept requires some interesting action between the characters  i cannot say that i know king lear the shakespeare version very well if i had known the play i would probably have been able to predict much of the film  well a crisis can bring the best and worst sides of a character on display  and we certainly see some bad sides oh yes the paint of civilisation and culture can be very thin and behind this paint you may find an animal  if you then compare it with italiensk for begyndere italian for beginners or mifunes sidste sang mifunes last song you see the same but opposite thing a crisis can certainly bring people to view their life in a more constructive way and if you dare do you may win  when the film had ended i thought to myself oh thats why i havent seen it before  the film has its own beauty the quality of the work of the cameraman actors etc is good but the script could need something more a plot maybe wouldnt hurt,negative,0
one of the most common entries in the goofs category is anachronism though im beginning to believe that anachronism and other goofs are more acceptable even ignored in very good films but are found front and center in rotten films kiss them for me is a rotten film and reeks of anachronism yet when watching it closely i found almost nothing specifically anachronistic  the shots of aircraft which bookend the film are certainly out of place the big 4 engine transport seen after the title honolulu 1944 appears to be the post war c97 stratofreighter in mats colors the combat planes seen taking off from the carrier at the end are douglas skyraiders which entered service after ww2 and were made famous by their service in vietnam  but excepting these two pieces of film and of course the hairstyles everything else is very possibly period authentic it just feels so wrong im an admirer of stanley donen we share the same birthday in his co directed on the town 1949 there is a car chase at the end with the police driving 194950 fords yet there isnt the slightest feeling that this is out of place in a ww2 period film in fact as i reflected later there isnt anything which says that this is supposed to be a ww2 period film it just feels that way based on a wartime broadway musical which was based on a ballet fancy free which may have been based on the work of artist paul cadmus the fleets in 1934 its a great film about sailors on a 24 hour pass in new york and so heavy with wartime associations its merely assumed it takes place during the war and yet these contemporary cars do nothing to break the spell  the first problem is old cary grant though far too old to represent a navy sbd dive bomber pilot it is a hollywood tradition for stars like grant gary cooper lou gehrig jimmy stewart charles lindbergh to play younger it was the role which he is miscast in not his age he plays an operator as they used to call them a guy who gets things done and breaks all the rules while doing it yet remains admired and loved for it a hustler a wheeler dealer a de rigueur character in a service comedy grant is the comic center of what is after all supposed to be a service comedy which is contra to his comedy style  thinking back on the great grant comic performances like bringing up baby 1938 or arsenic and old lace 1944 and he is the great reactor whose comedy is to be reduced by his context from dignity to a befuddled puddle of inert jelly in kiss them he is expected to be the comic spark plug which just isnt him people had already been exposed to the type most recently to comic phil silvers as sgt bilko on television the role would be perfected later by james garner but here grant just isnt funny and appears to be a bully getting his way by aggressively pushing his cary grantness rather than cajoling and finessing  but the thing which really stinks the place up with anachronism is the lead women there can be no more echt 50s women than suzy parker and jayne mansfield they are unique to the decade marilyn monroe can be placed in a continuum with carole lombard and marie wilson and any number of dumb blonds and grace kelly was another high class dame think of mary astor but there never could have been an anatomically exaggerated woman in films like mansfield sure there were the sweater girls eg lana turner of ww2 but mansfield was stretching the point suzy parker was the model who revolutionized the model business who changed the mannequin like poses to become the first natural girl who moved and whose personality was captured by the camera see funny face 1957 also by stanley donen  of course in high 50s style there seems to be a lot of gender mixing at wild parties but never even a hint of sex think of the 50s tv shows bachelor father or the bob cummings show where dinner jacketed men returned from dates alone the original book which i havent read was published during the war and appeared as a play on broadway at the end of the war and the nuances of the situation must have been inescapable for contemporary readers and audiences but broken down bowdlerized and reconstituted a dozen years later and fatally miscast it remains a once forgotten stain on otherwise exemplary careers until the invention of the vcr and cable television resurrected this petrified turkey  so the lesson here is whatever the goof it will be ignored in a great film like citizen kane who actually hears charles foster kane say rosebud and tolerated in fun dreck like westworld  why were the robots given live ammunition in the first place but absolutely despised in a rotten film even if the goofs are really non existent,negative,0
seems to have been made as a vehicle for wc fields and carol dempster and they dominate it fields already has his film character well developed carol dempster seems to dance through the film and her acting reminds me of mary pickford who also worked a long time under dw griffith typical of later griffith films technically  later remade as poppy the original title with fields in the same role,positive,1
island of death is not really a good movie by any standard but it is a curious one imagine if natural born killers had been made 20 years too early as a greek eurotrash porn film thats what you get here  the quaint story of a young sociopathic british couple cutting a deadly swath through the population of a lovely little greek island  ill spare you a detailed breakdown of the plot its not really important except to set up increasingly perverse or violent sex scenes followed by disturbingly brutal murders often lovingly photographed for posterity by our charming young couple it could have been brilliant in its own sick and nasty way but instead  instead i found myself impatiently checking the run time and chapter index to see how much longer the parade was going to last sluggish pacing and listless bland acting turn even vilest perversities into pablum and connecting scenes into an eternity of dull plodding ah well you cant win em all,negative,0

it has to be admitted that the best work of harold lloyd ended with his last great silent comedy speedy in 1928 after that he enters sound films like chaplin and keaton and laurel  hardy and wc fields and does do better than keaton but not as well as the other three chaplin was rich enough to make his own films as producer but he paced his films so there were five years between productions laurel  hardy were under the protection of hal roach so production standards for their shorts and sound films were pretty good fields first worked with mack sennett than with paramount and then freelanced lloyd tried the route that chaplin took but with less success  he produced his own films but unlike chaplin he did not own his own studio also his first two choices were not good especially feet first but he did begin to choose more wisely and movie crazy the catspaw and the milky way were all good choices these three and possibly the sin of harold diddlebock were his best sound ventures they are all entertaining but none are up to safety last the freshman the kid brother or speedy   of the top four sound films the cats paw is the most controversial ezekiel cobbs solution to ridding the city that elects him mayor is very extreme for the tastes of 2005 or is it when a movie is made dictates what its politics are the cats paw is from 1934 that second year of the roosevelt new deal itself rather controversial for heavier government involvement movie audiences saw films like gabriel over the white house and the phantom president where our leaders did extraconstitutional actions to rid the nation of internal enemies and to force disarmament around the globe even cecil b de mille got into this act with this day and age where a bunch of teenagers use rats to force a gangster to confess his crimes  to us the use of violence to force anyone even a bunch of goons and boodlers like alan dineharts gang to confess is repellent after all the supreme court has protected us from confession under duress what we forget is that the reforms we are thinking of did not occur until the warren court and the burger court made them for example although mr justice sutherlands opinion in the powell scottsboro boys case of 1932 guaranteed every criminal defendant had a right to counsel gideon v wainwright did not extend this to ordering court paid counsel to defendants until 1962 the miranda case with its now wellknown antiselfincrimination warning is from 1963 nothing like this were considered necessary in 1934  if you study other movies of the period up to 1954 and even to 1960 tricks are used to get confessions  kirk douglas confesses his crimes in front of witnesses in i walk alone while burt lancaster holds a gun to him when lancaster leaves douglas sneers about confessing under duress only to see the gun is unloaded suddenly he realizes that legally  in 1948 he has confessed without duress hate to say it to any civil libertarians reading this note but what cobblloyd does to dinehart and his pals in the conclusion of the cats paw was not only legal but would have led to their jail sentences in 1934 we may call it heavy handed fascistic or horrid but it would have worked legally when it was thought up,positive,1
i wish depardieu had been able to finish his book and see it become a dazzling success at least hed have wound up with something  the film struck me as pointless rambling and very stylish like some other recent french films not to knock it most recent american films are pointless and rambling and have no style whatever we should be grateful i suppose for photography that evokes a european city in the midst of a windblown continental winter and for elliptical conversations that challenge our ability to understand whats up  but there can be too much of a good thing golubeva is found stumbling around near the sea in the middle of the freezing night carrying on in a bad accent about dreams and such there are a few sequences of dreams that include things like swimming in a river of blood youll love it if youre vlad the impaler lots of people die catherine deneuve dies in a suicide by motorcycle i dont know why golubevas young girl dies too and i dont know why she dies either she gets slapped in the face falls to the pavement and dies  there is supposedly an explicit sex scene too ill have to take their word for it because although it is stylishly photographed it is stylishly photographed in almost complete darkness dont worry about the kiddies being shocked theyll probably be asleep by this time anyway  depardieu isnt a bad actor as we see him deteriorate from a carefully groomed handsome young man  well handsome except that his nose cant seem to get out of his way  to a limping murderous hairy physical wreck we feel sorry for the guy golubeva has a wan pretty face with enormous halflidded eyes and wide cheeks like a doll her next movie should be a remake of lewtons i walked with a zombie then there is this mysterious guy who leads a band i guess its a band as far as i could make out the band is made up of about a dozen drummers and a dozen musicians playing electric guitars every viewer will find the resultant sound interesting but uncultivated listeners fond of easy listening might not enjoy it if you dont like the music theres a payoff involved because the sinister composer and leader gets whacked over the head with depardieus walking stick  i must say i found it barely worth sitting through and its a longie too at times it was like waiting in your car at a railroad crossing while a long long freight train rumbles slowly by sometimes stopping entirely i wish it had had a few jokes,negative,0
barney and friendsthe dora the explorer of the 1990s  ok ill admit it as a kid barney was my ultimate hero i had my barney plush toy and i used to watch the same barney episodes over and over on videotape maybe cause it was so sugar coated and mindnumbing  however by the time i turned 7 i started to hate barney everyone at school would dis barney and i went along with it mainly because it was funny and its what little boys do but a few years later i discovered something else about barney that i will never forget  a person known on the imdb as angelmeiru did an essay for school explaining the dangers of watching barney and he or she posted it in the message boards a lot of those dangers made sense  barney is a dinosaur who can magically come to life during a day at school he is supposedly educational or so sheryl leach barneys creator says but really all i can remember him teaching me is that magic can solve anything which is not true  to end off this comment id like to tell you a little story there was once a young boy who watched a particular episode of barney one day he was alone when a stranger lured him into his car and drove away with him i dont know the outcome but its safe to assume the child died but why was he abducted in the first place because he watched the barney and friends episode titled a stranger is a friend you havent met yet   010,negative,0

when my 14yearold daughter and her friends get together for movie night theres one movie they insist on watching over and over again you guessed it k911 the third installment in the highly successful k9 franchise starring everybodys favorite tv dad jim belushi  folks i knew it was possible to wear out a vhs tape but a dvd this has been played so often that its starting to skip no joke but of course youll have that when you own a film so charming so brilliant  of course we have to thank the one and only tom hanks for introducing us to the beloved copdog genre with turner and hooch however even that film doesnt measure up to the sheer excellence presented in all three k9 movies  some naysayers say belushi ran out of steam with this third movie in the series poppycock i say while you might suspect that a third installment  directtovideo at that  may not seem like something worth watching youd prove yourself wrong after watching this quality movie  i wont give away the plot but i will say that belushi and his panting partner give their best performance yet  one that will have you howling with laughter its a shame john belushi isnt alive to see what great strides his brother has made in the acting world  i highly recommend your teenage daughter introduces this film to her bffs at her next slumber party dont forget the puppy chow,positive,1
whenever this film gets a mention usually the discussion begins and ends with the wonderful collection of cars and drag scenes often overlooked are the at times eclectic characters that populate the film around the three central characters  one character that stands out is rebel played by the great veteran australian actor max cullen rebel is a blind drag racer who nearly runs down the hero and his group in the middle of the night because he is not using any headlights  in the back story we discover that rebel master builder of street racing cars and he and his wife seem locked in a time warp of the 1950s rebel goes on to play a small but pivotal role in teaching mike played by terry serio the almost spiritual truth about street drag racing it is not speed reaction times that make a great racer it is the one who feels the car best who will become the greatest  this is best exemplified as rebel explains to mike after a test drive you got all the agony just missing the style  graham bond is another well credited actor lending his talents as a crooked police officer looking to get in on some of the financial action being generated by the street racing the confrontation between bond and fox played by richard moir adds tension to the story bond not only expects results but also fox to drum up racing business  for most of the movie fox displays a real manipulative and evil side yet in the climax he presents a sense of honor that turns the final few minutes into an extremely tense and memorable ending it is almost as if the film is refocusing on its true intention to show us the culture of street racing rather than the day to day activities of people  one of the major complaints about the film is the script although it is nothing exciting i believe the complete lack of any chemistry between mikes girlfriend played by deborah conway and his mechanic played by vangelis mourikis has more to do with the problem any scene in which these two interact simply should have been cut  lastly in terms of the actors one truly standout performance is delivered by kristoffer greaves who plays a deaf and crippled member of foxs inner circle his back story is never explored was he injured in a race born that way what is it that fox sees value in to keep him around   the reality of the film is simple it is about street racing and the culture behind it when the cars are flying and action sequences are in motion it is the only time director john clark and his writer barry tomblin seem really comfortable with what they are doing  so if you are looking for an in depth exploration of human relationships moments of life defining drama then this film is not for you if your pulse races at the thought of a blown 57 chev or the iconic gto phase 3 blazing away on the streets of sydney then you wont find much better than this film,positive,1
the acting in the film is really well done honestly but the movie is so slow and so boring as soon as it gets interesting everything slows to a major halt i am glad to see sam rockwell in this he did a great job so did the other actors as i mentioned but man this is one of the worst dragged out films i have ever seen now maybe in a short film form this movie would be good but other than that avoid it this film has so much filler it makes a twinkie cake jealous   i never ever walk out on films but watching this one at home with family i walked out yeah it was that boring apparently my comment doesnt have enough lines to post so heres some more filler i guess i was inspired by the movie i just watched,negative,0
i have to say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel jane eyre both dalton and clarke are very believable as rochester and jane ive seen other versions but none compare to this one the best one for me i could never imagine anyone else playing these characters ever again the last time i saw this one was in 1984 when i was only 13 at that time i was a bookworm and i had just read charlotte brontes novel i was completely enchanted by this miniseries and i remember not missing any of the episodes id like to see it again because its so good ,positive,1
this may be all you need to know in order to decide whether you want to see this  the movie is bad really really bad and sometimes it seems to be aware of that and make fun of how bad it is it aligns cliche after cliche and even manages to grow worse as it goes along with some moments that are bad enough to be hilariously funny  if you can laugh about really poor quality in script writing and production values you might enjoy it otherwise prepare for some serious brain damage  310,negative,0

ronald colman plays a prodigal son while he is not a bad guy he is a bit flighty and hasnt done a lot with his life other than travel the world and have a jolly good time now that his latest venture in africa has failed hes on his way home to england his rich upper class father plans on tossing him out on his ear though thanks to ronalds winning style he is reluctantly welcomed back with open arms  at this point there are two women in his lifeshowgirl myrna loy and rich girl loretta young who is already engaged how will all this work out and will ronald wise up and act like a responsible adultthese are the main themes of this pleasant little film  this isnt a great movie and certainly wont change your life but it certainly is very entertaining and fun most of this is due to the always genial acting of ronald colman heck in the heyday of his career in the 1930s he could have played in reefer madness or some other dreck and still made it entertaining and likable due to his charming persona his seemingly effortless style in this movie make it very easy to like him and its easy to see why both loretta young and myrna loy are in love with him in the film plus the writing is very witty and make this a nice romanticcomedy,positive,1
i have no idea what idiots gave this movie a palm dor at the 1999 cannes film festival because it was atrocious i actually watched the entire thing simply because i couldnt believe that someone would make such a worthless film there is nothing interesting about the plot the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt at giving any sort of ambiance with music or sound effects also if you do decide to waste 2 hours of your life by watching this film be sure to bring something to throw up in because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a handheld camcorder and half the time you cant even see the main subjects this style has been used much more successfully in movies such as blair witch because it creates suspense in rosetta there is no plot and no suspense to which that style would lend anything i should have known better when it came on at 2 oclock in the morning that it was going to be horrible,negative,0
what makes for best picture material the oscars have come in for a lot of stick for rewarding overblown spectacles that have aged poorly and ignoring the auteurs who would be deified in decades to come it wasnt because hollywood was against art or creativity the academy awards are the selections made by the industry itself and that is why at least in the classic era they tended to reward the greatest collaborations the most sensational meetings of creative minds  the arthur freed unit at mgm had been bound for oscarwinning glory for several years by this point it was only a matter of time before freed aided by his strongest director vincente minnelli and some the finest musical stars in the business would land a best picture freed had arguably done more to raise the status of the musical than anyone else crafting pictures which wove story and song together without losing the dynamic spectacle of the 30s musicals the point about freed musicals is that the lyrics of the songs unlike those of hammerstein or lerner dont have to tell or even relate to the stories whats important is that the tone of the song and the way it is presented fit into the structure of the film  an american in paris was the first of three freed musicals the other two being singin in the rain and the band wagon which took existing classic numbers out of their original context and made them work in a completely unrelated story the words dont fit the plot but the routines fit the show so when gene kelly sings i got rhythm he hasnt even got a girl yet but the way its done with the french kids joining in is a great bit of characterisation and the upbeat tune and dance gives the movie the little lift it needs at this point an american in paris also uses the rulebreaking allowed in the genre to add little unconventional flights of fancy to tell the story such as the series of dances which accompany the description of leslie carons character  and what better director for this project than minnelli himself a painter and a pianist at this time there wasnt really anyone who had a better feel for technicolor while some directors would saturate each scene in one colour or fill the screen with clashing shades minnellis colour schemes are tightly controlled but never look forced in the opening scenes the tones are fairly muted but not drab and in particular there is an absence of red during oscar levant and georges guetarys meeting in the café a few more vibrant shades are introduced then during the first musical number by strauss minnelli gradually brings in splashes of red  a table cloth a bunch of roses  until it eventually dominates as if the song has awoken the pictures colour scheme for most of the songs the colours are choreographed as intricately as the people however in some numbers such as tralala he keeps the shades the same and instead opens out the space as the song swells up and the characters become more animated  the achilles heel of an american in paris is its story i personally find the romantic angle particularly unpalatable playing as it does like a last hurrah for the misogynistic love stories that reigned supreme in the 30s the headstrong independent woman gets rejected while the meek delicate girl is harassed into loving the hero even if you dont mind that it is difficult to connect emotionally with the story because it is constantly overshadowed by the songs and dances compare this to singin in the rain which doesnt really have as many great routines or memorable setpieces as an american in paris but it has a winning storyline singin in the rain was overlooked at the 1952 oscars yet it is regarded as a classic of the genre today but i think people sometimes forget that cinema is an allencompassing form of visual entertainment not just a means of telling a story an american in paris is not deep or engaging or tearjerking but like a certain demille picture that won the top award the following year it certainly is a great show,positive,1

the key scene in rodrigo garcias nine lives comes when sissy spacek hidden away in a hotel room where she is carrying on an affair with aiden quinn find a nature documentary on television at which point quinn notes the contrivance of such thingsdisparate footage is edited into one scene predators and preys are thrown together in order to capture the momentall to force connections where none actually exist characters in the nine shorts that make up this film occasionally spill over into each others stories but none of them ever seem to really connect a woman preparing for a violent confrontation with her abusive father is later seen working in a hospital room where another woman is preparing for a mastectomy a man who runs into an old girlfriend in a supermarket and sees how his life should have been later hosts with his current wife a dinner party for an unhappy couple garcia arranges some of his characters in front of each other but none of the subsequent stories ever really build on what came before  garcias first film the wonderful overlooked things you can tell just by looking at her also had a shortstory structure and overlapping characters but there were fewer of them and they had a lot more room to breathe and grow the gimmicky premise of nine lives that each of its nine stories is told in a single unbroken take in real time never allows the film to build up any real dramatic tension or momentum its also a fairly visually ugly movie interior shots are often murky and hard to watch while other scenesparticularly one where a girl walks back and forth between rooms to talk to her uncommunicative parentsare rendered annoying by the camerawork given that this is garcias third film and that he has a respectable history of directing for television the direction in this film is rather surprisingly amateurish like fellow filmmakerchildofagreatwriter rebecca miller garcia son of gabriel garcia marquez is focused on the writing and character aspects of his films often to the detriment of the filmmaking ones  individual scenes are touching and even affecting i did like jason issacs kissing robin wright penns pregnant belly and joe mantegna whispering lovingly to his wife as she slips into presurgery sedation and sissy spacek stealing a few happy moments away from her life with aiden quinn before brought back to it with a phone call from her daughter but the film unlike things you can tell just by looking at her feels more like an exercise than actual drama we are just watching people act,negative,0
enjoy the opening credits theyre the best thing about this secondrate but inoffensive timekiller which features passable performances from the likes of eric roberts and martin kove the main part however goes to newcomer tommy lee thomas who looks a bit diminutive for this kind of action but who nevertheless occasionally manages to project a bantyrooster kind of belligerence the first time we see him hes barechested sweaty and engaged in that favorite beefcake activity  chopping wood after this he has seven more scenes without his shirt including one in which hes hanged by his wrists and zapped with electricity a la mel gibson in lethal weapon he could use a better script however since the manner in which he exposes the truth about corruption and violence inside the prison is never very convincing theres also talk about millions of dollars which apparently is tied in with this investigation but which is never explained there are a few pluses though sending john woodrow undercover as john wilson is an amusing play on a presidential name and costar jody ross nolan shows promise as an inmate who early in the proceedings is shown hanged by his wrists and getting punched by a burly guard one final note the movies low budget is painfully responsible for the lack of extras despite the impressive size of the prison it only seems to hold about 12 inmates note the cast credits at the end arent too helpful for the record the burly baldheaded guard who uses jody nolan as a punching bag is played by bill fishback and the young fairhaired guard who administers electric shocks to tommy lee thomas is played by marc chenail,negative,0
this is a movie about how men think women think about love no woman describes a onenight sexual encounter and declares it a love story  of the ten monologues i felt only three really had any kind of truth ring through them i kept waiting for the film to get better and it did a bit but never better enough  this is an interesting concept and i kept wanting it to be good but it never succeeded maybe if they actually were love stories it would have worked,negative,0

una giornata particolare is a movie that has a title that sounds so familiar i thought i had seen it more than once now that i finally i have seen it i am very glad this is one of the better italian movies i know with one of the most wonderful performances by marcello mastroianni who stars in other masterpieces such as la dolce vita and 8 12 both from the great federico fellini directed by ettore scola this is a movie that takes the time to introduce the characters and slowly develops a story on a special day the day adolf hitler visited rome  marcello mastroianni plays gabriele the neighbor of antonietta sophia loren she is a member of mussolinis party pretty fanatic in her thoughts and he is a member no more the reason for that i will not reveal on the day every person from their building including her husband and children is out to see hitler they are still in the building antoniettas bird escapes and flies to gabrieles apartment and this is how the two meet right before antonietta went to gabriele he thought of killing himself again for reasons i will not reveal how the story develops from here i will not reveal but it is what happens between the two that makes this such a special day not the fact that hitler is in rome  like i said mastroianni has a wonderful performance you see he is a man who desperately wants someone around him although at first we dont know why may be he likes antonietta may be he is in love with her may be there are other reasons antonietta feels what we feel what does this man want from her she likes the attention anyway we see how she does her hair to look attractive for the man loren plays the scenes very good as well we understand her questions although we cant be sure what her intentions are the moments where we find out both their secrets if that is what you can call it is a great moment how the story develops from there is even more interesting but i dont want to spoil it for you this is a movie you should see great performances and a beautiful cinematography and the message it gives us still stands today,positive,1

i took part in a little mini production of this when i was a bout 8 at school and my mum bought the video for me ive loved it ever since when i was younger it was the songs and spectacular dance sequences that i enjoyed but since ive watched it when i got older i appreciate more the fantastic acting and character portrayal oliver reed and ron moody were brilliant i cant imagine anyone else playing bill sykes or fagin shani wallis nancy if the best character for me she put up with so much for those boys i think shes such a strong character and her final scene when well you know always makes me cry best musical in my opinion of all time its lasted all this time it will live on for many more years to come 1110,positive,1
it plays like your usual teenageaudience ta movie but the sentiment is incredibly bleak if it was made today itd be considered an art house movie it goes through the usual routine of a guy trying to get laid but the results of his efforts are harsh and cruel and unsatisfying  the whole teen flick formula is adhered to but nothing turns out the way youd expect imagine a directors cut of its a wonderful life where at the end james stewart wasnt allowed to return to the real world an incredible film that subverts all of the expectations of the genre it makes you feel dirty afterwards there is no redemption for the characters im amazed it ever got made the eighties version of detective story,positive,1
following which the touted update goes and shoots itself through the head rather apt considering the sorry state of this movie a sequel to a film which patently didnt need one  what really irritates about robocop 2 is that the makers obviously didnt understand why the original was so good in the first place robocop 7 was a witty vibrant satire of bad action movies robocop 2 is just a bad action movie  thin on dialogue particularly towards the tedious shootout finale it attracts little interest and possesses none of the energy or spirit of the original the spoof ads now a little tasteless warning continued use will cause skin cancer seem merely there as an afterthought and calling a new designer drug nuke is nowhere near as subtle or as funny as the originals family board game nuke em  the stopmotion animation  the weakest element of the original  is used more extensively while this humourless sequel fails to include a credits sequence which makes it look even more cheap and hurried ah humourless you might say but what about the funny mayor or the way robo is reprogrammed to spout platitudes yes these are attempts at light relief as is robo tightening himself up with a screwdriver were only human for the films punchline but none are likely to induce laughter like the rest of the film theyre staid and moronic attempts at entertainment  the third and final film in the series imaginatively titled robocop 3 5 saw peter weller leave to be replaced by robert john burke who does well in a undemanding role with toneddown language and violence it was an obvious plea to the kiddie market a robo action figure much plugged throughout with its social conscience too overstated and robocops newfound arm attachments and jetpack getting too silly the final film was never destined to be a masterpiece yet fluid direction by fred dekker and a flowing pace make this one enjoyably throwaway viewing  robocop then is the film proper robocop 3 is the sequel which you could watch if there was nothing better on which leaves the second movie hanging in the middle an unwatchable dirge of a picture a franchise vehicle that has nothing to say save for the pound signs that rung up irvin kershner is no paul verhoven just as comic artist frank miller and partner walon green arent the writers that edward neumeier and michael miner were a tragic waste of a good if limited concept 410,negative,0
one of the best films i have seen in the past five years the cast is universally spectacular in a tale of young love and bravado on the lower east side of new york city with the two leads being superstars in the making funny charming sad and inspiring this is a totally refreshing take on urban youth that puts larry clarks oftennauseating shtick in the gutter where it belongs although i have to admit that bully was a cut above his normal fare raising victor vargas is one film you will kick yourself for missing so dont miss it,positive,1
very good westernthis was the first time writer richard wilson directed a film also this was a first for samuel goldwyn junior as a producer it is a pleasure to see a very young and pretty angie dickinson as a saloon girl robert mitchum comes to this town dominated by outlaws and is hired as a town tamer but people are worried that he will go too far also about the harm that he will do to the town´s businesses there are some similarities in the story with warlock which was made in 1959 this film keeps a very fast and exciting pace it really keeps you on the edge,positive,1
sure this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clichés but its entertaining and thats what i watch movies for to be entertained natasha henstridge is stunning even with the short hair her smile is radiant and her beauty cant be disguised as for michael vartan im sure the women love him the two of them seemed to really like eacb other in this film i dont understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them i guess we see what we want to see  olivia dabo and michael rigoli were fun to watch even if dabos british accent did creep into her supposed bronx speech to tell you the truth i hadnt really noticed it until i read these comments but i went back to the dvd and now her dialogue sounds more british than american to me but she was ideal for her role with that one exception   its a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others but who find their soul mates in one another it may be an unlikely story but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries it is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube thats why we watch them to escape from the humdrum of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen i thought these actors did a good job of it but hey im a sentimental guy who tears up easily dont get me wrong though it has to be a sentimental scene and this movie had plenty of those  i give it 910 only because im saving my 1010 for that yet unseen super magnificent movie that i know will come along some day if you see it advertised as coming up on the movie channel or lifetime movies or whatever make a note to watch it i think youll like it,positive,1
begotten is one of the most unique films ive ever seen it is more to me a study of sound light and dark and movement than a real story the type of thing you see as a video instillation at the museum of modern art than a film enjoyed at the local theater im not going to try to interpret the images of the mother nature the beasts in cloaks the twisted and tortured body of her child some things just defy interpretation,positive,1
this is a very very boring and uninteresting action film and without chuck norris it would have been unbearable plus the low budget shows big time some of the fights were good but the story is laughable and there no menacing villains at allthe dialog was laughable i had some trouble finishing this film but chuck norris made it somewhat bearable i really have nothing more to say since i was only paying half attentionbecause it was so incredibly boring however it did pick up a tiny bit towards the end the direction is terrible don hulette does a terrible job here with lousy photography an awful pace and overall the film looked dull there is no gore the acting was terrible chuck norris is very good here he kicks that ass and he made the film almost bearablechuck rules george murdock is terrible as the main villain and very unconvincing terry oconnor is decent here and had okay chemistry with chuck michael augenstein is decent as chucks brother overall its quite simple avoid  out of 5 chuck saves it from the bomb rating,negative,0
i saw this movie with my friend and we couldnt stop laughing i mean there was nothing scary about this movie it was funny all the lines freddy said were hilarious i think they shoudlnt have even made a new nightmare and just gone to freddy vs jason although some parts were gross like the head blowing up and any elm street film from 1 5 sucked this was the best besides number 1 i wouldnt recomend this movie if you want a good horror but if you have nothing else to do rent this and youll laugh aloti want to see the texas chainsaw massacre i think it would be scary freddys dead the final nightmare overall grade b,positive,1

one of the worst movies ive ever seen acting was terrible both for the kids and the adults most to all characters showed no little or not enough emotion the lighting was terrible and there were too many mess ups about the time of the day the film was shot in the river scene where they just get their boat destroyed theres 4 shots the sheriff and dad in the evening on their boat jillian and molly in the evening swimming the rest of the kids in the daytime when its supposed to in the evening at the river bank and the doctor beatrice and simonton at night but not in the evening getting off their boat the best acting in the movie was probably from the sheriff cappy although theres a slip of character when the pulse detector whatever that thing is when people die it beeps shows cappy has died he still moves while it can still be heard beeping and while the nurse extra checks his pulse manually then it shows the pulse again and then he finally dies i guess its not going to be perfect since its an independent movie but it still could be better not worth watching honestly even for kids might as well watch something good like the lion king or toy story if youre going to see anything youll remember,negative,0

bread very sharply skewers the conventions of horror movies in general and night of the living dead in specific and is constantly inventive the production values are a little rough at times its a student film after all but it never loses sight of its goal to entertain hey  george romero liked it enough to include it on the remastered dead video tape laserdisc and dvd that should tell you something,positive,1
when this first came out my dad brought it home we were amazed by it it was so different from anything we had seen before i was looking for a specific movie last night and i found the minds eye again the box is falling apart and i am surprised that the tape still works although it is not finding nemo quality graphics it is still very good they should sell this again it is a landmark for computer animation imagery highly recommended,positive,1
return to me is a charming gem of a movie with an absolutely star studded cast who can go wrong with this modern day fairy tale it also includes many many jokes written by the funny girl herself bonnie hunt who wrote and directed this film david duchovny is also very good showing a different approach then from his everday alterego mulder on my favourite show the xfiles a great date movie,positive,1
a ridiculous movie a terrible editing job worst screenplay ridiculous acting a story that is completely ununderstandable  if god was going to decide if movies should continue to be done judging by this one the entire world movie industry would now be dead  a wonderful movie to show that cinema should not be done by people who think they can make movies  i am still wondering who are those two gipsy girls who show up in the movie for over half an hour and are never introduced to us  ,negative,0
after watching this film i thought to myself they really glossed up errol flynns life the movie is really nice eye candy they really got the 1930s and 1940s atmosphere of hollywood just right the costumes were great all the women looked glamorous and all the men looked handsome and debonair  is this a serious film about errol flynns life nah its a fun movie based on all the scandalous stuff he did in his life  why am i critiquing this film this is a film that had a lot of promise but failed to deliver duncan reagher was really good as errol flynn he was not as good looking as the original but he made you believe that flynn was not just a handsome playboy who did not take himself seriously but as a man who although gifted with great talent was kind of disturbed and unhappy inside flynns love life was a disaster considering he had so many failed marriages he also lost a lot of good friends during his life he also suffered from unrequited love for the elegant olivia dehavilland the last scene of the film showed errol kind of begging for olivia to stay with him and instead she walks away he is shown in his tux looking really empty and slowly walking around the pool as he pours his drink into the pool it was a sad way to end the film but kind of fitting because everyone knows by now how he eventually fell apart from his alcoholism and his dissipated lifestyle  this film couldve had much more depth couldve been better wellwritten sure they showed all the scandals but they never showed errol flynns human center surprisingly duncan reagher was able to put some emotional depth into the character of errol flynn even though the film writing didnt put any depth there  ill probably never see this film again but i can still remember after viewing this film gosh this couldve been so much more i give this film a d,negative,0
i dont particularly care from michael jackson aside from being a pedophile i really do not like his music with the exceptions of a few songs from his landmark album thriller this is one of them i do like this video because it is one of the first and most important music videos ever made  this was directed by john landis best known to horror fans as the director of an american werewolf in london this music video is not so much a music video but more or less a short horror film mj and his date are at a werewolf movie when they leave the movie they are attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty zombies when michael jackson does his famous thriller dance  you know this actually is a pretty good song with good synthesized beats this and beat it are probably the only two michael jackson songs i can tolerate over and over i especially love vincent prices cameo as the narrator his distinctive voice is perfect for a horrorthemed music video even if you dont like mjs music you need to see this video at least once by the way he was good before becoming a creepy white woman with a fake nose,positive,1
dull acting weak scriptworst spanish movie in yearsi was  attracted by the naked beauty of paz vega but as an actress  shes useless you almost cant understand what shes saying  about the story theres not much coherent to saywe heard of it  before but as this is a modern carmen we find a few changes the french soldier is now a basque soldier merimee himself is a character in the story carmen is a dangerous bandolera in love with a famous  matador and she can speak fluent basque  can anyone understand this mess,negative,0
the two most noteworthy things about i wont play are it won an academy award as the best tworeel short film of 1944 and it was directed by silentera leading man crane wilbur the plot of this runofthemill short is inconsequential the dialogue lacks spark while the acting is no better and no worse than that found in most warthemed hollywood movies of the 1940s in other words its awful admittedly there are moments when i wont play is funny  janis paiges totally artificial look and line delivery are precious  but one laughs at the picture not with it,negative,0
i simply cant get over how brilliant the pairing of walter matthau and jack lemmon is its like the movie doesnt even need additional characters because you can never get tired of the dialog between these two  lemmon had already been in several wellknown films like mr roberts and the apartment and matthau was fresh off his oscar win for the fortune cookie another billy wilder film also with lemmon that particular movie wasnt as great as this one because the story couldnt sustain such a long running time i think it was almost 2 hours however this goes by at a brisk hour and a half even though the introduction of the events leading up to lemmon ending up at matthaus apartment is a tad long so was this sentence thats a minor quibble though and for the rest of the running time you have a marvelous time  i have already written a comment about how the followup to this film sucked and i wont go deeper into that the reason why this is such a joy is probably that the movie was made just as the innocence of american movies was beginning to fade fast into oblivion there are some sexual references but they are dealt with in such an innocent way that you couldnt even get a well i never out of the most prudish person out there it is kind of fun to see a movie from a long lost era and that was probably why the sequel didnt work because you had matthau and lemmon say quite a few fwords and that just doesnt fit them  of course now they are both gone and you can just be happy that you still can enjoy them in a marvelous film like this i think the only male actor in this film who is still alive is john fiedler edelman died recently so there you have it simply one of the best comedies and films ever  add i have just learned recently that john fiedler has died so to all the fans of him i am deeply sorry i didnt mean any disrespect and i will try to be more careful of what i am blah blah blahing next time,positive,1
warning contains many spoilers  let me start by saying i have a huge respect for gillian andersons incredible talent as a varied and versatile actress  which is why i cannot comprehend her reasons for agreeing to make this film once she saw the script or lack thereof   the premise of the film was in my opinion a great idea and there were some genuinely thoughtprovoking themes in there but it ended up like a collapsed soufflé it exemplifies why i hate 99 of british cinema it feels too long its tedious for the most part and not a lot happens after the first twenty minutes just when you think theres a chance of it picking up some speed it disappoints like paula radcliffe running a marathon with little imaginative directing and a minimalist plot there isnt much to keep the audience from nodding off into their popcorn as for the script i can only surmise that the writer was trying to save a few trees with the average scene reading something along the lines of alice f off adam stares adam runs off into woodsalice follows alice adam adam i suspect that word for word the actors probably got paid more than kate moss did for her virgin mobile adverts what few lines there were didnt have a lot of variation with a frequent use of the fword that would make bridget joness friend shazza proud there is little establishment of the main characters before the main sordid event which leaves the audience lacking much sympathy for the characters beyond an automatic oh thats terrible reaction  alice isnt the kind of woman who courts sympathy either shes got a great job an expensive london apartment with roof space to die for yet she comes across on screen as conceited bitter and dissatisfied before her life takes a turn for the worst after the attack a few layers are peeled back which sortof explain why she is this way to start with she grew up with a toughasoldboots soldier who thought that teaching her how to shoot his gun was the ultimate expression of love so instead of following in his footsteps she ran away to the big city in search of something to make her feel like her life is worth living instead she found a group of stereotypical middleclass toffs who look down on anyone not rich enough to drive a lexus and the luxuries that come with an integrated securityentertainment system ie becoming mrs robinson to a wannabe cockney wideboy electrician someone pass me a tissue the one saving grace of this character is that she is played by gillian anderson in the hands of a lesser actress she wouldve been intolerably onedimensional but ms anderson actually manages to inject a few fleeting moments of humanity into this otherwise lifeless human being most notably when shes sincerely apologising for her road rage in a vain attempt to stop her attackers from continuing their assault  i cant say that adam fared much better either danny dyer played him well as a fishoutofwater jack the lad but a good performance couldnt save him from both the lack of a script and the total absence of any character background   this film relied mostly on shock value but the timing was off and it felt far too engineered from beginning to end as for the shock the most shocking thing about this film is the unashamed demonstration of how painfully thin ms anderson has become it was almost as unsettling to see as the brutal attack scenes on a side note only in a british film would a gang of violent sex attackers take the time to offer each other contraception before continuing to cheer their mates on  talk about stiffupperlip taken to the extreme if this is the kind of film that the national lottery is donating money to make then im not surprised that fewer and fewer people are choosing to spend their pound each week   saying that i hated this film is giving it too much credit i didnt care enough about any of the characters to warrant that strong an emotion i want that oneandabit hours of my life back please,negative,0
i am a sucker for films like this films that take you back and let you relive your childhood im a grown up now and have many grown up responsibilities like a mortgage kids dogs a wife and a slew of others i enjoy my life but it is not as innocent and carefree like it was when i was twelve mike binders indian summer knows this and explores this like he was twelve years old it brings you back to a time when life was simpler and much more fun it brings you back to a time when worrying about your first kiss and wondering if you could finish the camp marathon were important issues indian summer is a fantastic film and it is one that should be watched at least once a year just so you can sit back and laughand reminisce  the film stars kevin pollak bill paxton diane lane and matt craven to name a few as childhood friends that are being summoned back to camp tamakwa by their former head camp counsellor uncle lou uncle lou is played perfectly by alan arkin he is kind of guy who is the patriarch of the group he is also all knowing and encompasses the true spirit of a father figure and someone who understands the simple things in life he has a hard time relating to todays kids that need a walkman blaring in their ears when they are at a place of immense beauty like tamakwa this is a camp that has moose wandering through the camp leaves turning colours that god gave them and water for as far as the eye can see uncle lou yearns for the days of old and asks his former campers back to the camp to see one of them will take over the camp while they are all together again we get to see their trials and tribulations and perhaps a new love could spring between them  as the adults return to the camp it isnt long before they act like kids again as the typical camp pranks get played all over again they take toilet paper out of the stalls the put toothpaste on sleeping bags and so on all of this is done hilariously and with actors like pollak and paxton it is all very funny stuff  but beyond the hilarity we get to explore some very real adult emotion that anyone can relate to in one of my favourite scenes kevin pollak and elizabeth perkins are overlooking a bay where they used to go canoing as kids pollak cant get over how small it all looks and perkins finally tells him that the bay didnt get smaller they just got bigger it doesnt hammer the point home but it does it subtly we all grow up we all move on and we all unfortunately cant live like we did 20 years ago the more things change the more they stay the same  indian summer is a character driven film and it is written beautifully by mike binder who actually did attend camp camp tamakwa as did sam raimi who played stick in the film and it is his fond and vivid memories of his experiences that fuel the film there are many touching scenes and there are many hilarious ones also both are perfect  i love this film i love everything about it and it is a true hidden gem  1010,positive,1
this film was not about stereotypes nor dance moves nor pickup lines really this film was about the vulnerability of peoples hearts it was hard to believe that kevin james could play in a convincing role that will smith could satisfy without action and that such a hackneyed genre of film could succeed in such a way i dont intend to sound overly endeared with this film  it wasnt groundbreaking in any sort of way  but it was a film worth seeing was it believable no new york couldnt be so simple and there has been no human being in the history of mankind that has the hutzpah of hitch sure there are barstuds but not ones that can get any chick at any time  excluding those raking in seven figures of course the thing that worked best for this film was its true focus on the dramatic side of things not just on the comedy it was a funny two hours no doubt but it was also two hours that made you sit in your seat become immersed in the characters and smile,positive,1
i have seen this film only once on tv and it has not been repeated this is strange when you consider the rubbish that is repeated over and over again usually horror movies for me are a source of amusement but this one really scared me  do not read the next bit if you havent seen the film yet  the scariest bit is when the townsfolk pursue the preacher to where his wife lies almost dead theyd been poisoning her he asks who the hell are you people anyway one by one they give their true identities the girl who was pretending to be deaf in order to corrupt and seduce him says i am lilith the witch who loved adam before eve,positive,1
seymour cassel gives a great performance a tour de force his acting as supposed washed up beach stud duke slusarski will always have a place in my heart the film is centered around a nerd who just came to the beach in hopes of honoring his dead brothers dreams what he gets is lame surf hijinks guys cheating guys fighting and guys getting drunk going to watch surf documentaries with the whole town of la on a friday night duke takes the nerd in and tries to teach him how playing volleyball is like touching a woman next time my woman talks back i will pretend im spiking the ball   back to seymour cassel the end of the movie turns into a good drama since the first half of the film really had no point duke plays a wonderful game of volleyball the best hes played in over ten years the way the scene is shot is beautiful you can feel the heart this man has for the game and the love of being on the beach those five minutes will go down as one of my favorites of all time 310 bad to fair the rest of the movie was lame,negative,0
i enjoy films of various kinds and qualities whether its your typical standard hollywood action movie or your oscar season tearjerker movies that meet a certain standard will almost always be enjoyable for me  in soap girl i received nothing but confusion first we meet maya a massage parlor worker who seems to attract all the customers in the parlor a virgin poet named harry comes in one day and they fall in love after that there are various twists and turns thrown into the plot which seem to lead nowhere  although many have commented on the controversial issue of an asian prostitute being exploited by the white man keep in mind that this film was made by an asian director who wanted to bring light to the issue but whether he succeeds or not does not matter for the issue at hand is whether the movie is enjoyable or not  for me soap girl fails to meet the standard i expect from movies it was hard for me to get involved emotionally with this movie given the loose plot and the mediocre acting worse it seems as if the director wanted to make a drama when the tone falls more towards comedy  a movie such as soap girl which fails to trap me into the magic of cinema will always leave me bored throughout the movie i couldnt help but think what is this really about a movie has to answer that question before it is made if not what youll end up with is an empty push to captivate the audience  grade d  ,negative,0
this is the followup creation to better off dead in a competition better off dead would win handsdown but for star power one crazy summer outshines savage steves better script problems with one crazy summer ocs casting better off dead bod was cast so much better friendship ocs shows cusack giving hateful looks to bill murrays little bro trouble on the set more outrageous friends in ocs but more genuine friends in bod plot was good youll predict some of it but even the predictable parts go further than you think they could so even though this is better off deads ugly stepsister its worth a look see demi moore before the plastic surgery if for no other reason john cusack fans you gotta see it just to say you have if you dont like bobcat golthwaite im sorry i dont like him either but you cant escape him in this one at least he does a great job in the film doing a tribute to another movie monster editing needed help on the beach but for most part not much to complain about overall its good and funny but try not to compare it to bod or youll find it lacking sigh,positive,1
this is by far the most repulsive and atrocious version of the scarlet pimpernel ever to be devised as a pimpernel fan i was sincerely offended by what they did to the charactersbut this atrocity is not worth watching even if you arent familiar with the story  percy blakeney for example would never stab people in the back just to get down a hallway chauvelin would never have a string of women in his bed marguerite never had an affair with chauvelin nor armand with minette whoever the heck she is chauvelin would not randomly shoot tony in the head chauvelins name is not nor has it ever been paul they have completely eradicated any reference to the pimpernels disguises replacing them instead with james bondesque gadgets and gizmos  as to the film itself the makeup is horrifying the women look like clowns elizabeth mcgoverns beauty mark wanders around her face at random the poor pitiable actors have no script to work with so its not really their fault that their characters are as thin as wet tissue paper the dialogue oh the dialogue the dialogue is unbearable and whoever is responsible for all those little captions at the bottom of the screen should be forced to watch this movie as penance i counted 13 location captions in the first halfhour before i gave up as if we cant figure out that the body of water between england and france is the english channel  the filmif i can bring myself to call it that since its really just videotape with a filteris absolutely without redeeming value do not waste your time and brain cells on this rancid drivelinstead go watch the 1982 anthony andrewsjane seymour version or the 1934 leslie howard film or indeed anything but this one,negative,0

a real classic ten out of ten every actor is perfect the screenplay is a haunting succession of suspenseful scenes scenes in car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking wonder if this film is already out in dvd because it must be seen in widescreen version saw this film in the late fifties maybe three or four times and never since then forgot iti remember it was one of the first warner like cinemas cope features process called warnerscope which gave a very neat cinematography shelley winters and jack palance deserved an oscar for their performancesthe only thing i could criticize is not having been directed by someone like say nicholas ray to increase its rhythm and tension,positive,1
this murder mystery with musical numbers is long on atmosphere and character but rather short on suspense and plausibility based on a stage play by broadway showman earl carroll and others it combines a whodunit plot with a backstage ambiance a homicide investigation takes place on opening night at the theatre where a musical revue is being staged  the cast is impressive and varied toughgoofy victor mclaglen as the police officer who leads the investigation and never fails to leer idiotically at whatever showgirl happens to be in sight jack oakie the prewar jack lemmon  or was jack lemmon the postwar jack oakie as the harassed director who must coordinate the staged performance as well as the chaos behind the scenes the everhomely jessie ralph as a wardrobe mistress with deep dark secrets dorothy stickney who has a stunning closeup monologue near the end as the tremulous maid madly in love with the male lead carl brisson the danish star as that very male lead warbling the classic cocktails for two not once but twice kitty carlisle operatically delivering where do they come from and where do they go and other johnstoncoslow songs the glorious gertrude michael who parted from us too soon as a meanspirited showgirl whose love for brisson is spurned the usually ridiculous toby wing who here at least is the center of a laughgetting running joke  when the plot complications get out of hand there is always an interesting performer or fun and tuneful musical number to distract the viewer the films most celebrated sequence is the marahuana number led by michaels but aside from its controversial history its really one of the lesser musical offerings all of the songs here are staged as if they could actually have fit into a standard proscenium theatre space as opposed to the cinematic fantasy setup of the busby berkeley style,positive,1
as with all the other reviewers this movie has been a constant in my mind after 30 years i recall going to the library researching all that i could on this story i even wrote to the pbs station for more information despite all this all i was able to find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early part of the 1900s  fastward to 2002 after years of searching ebay for on a weekly basis and there it was a vhs copy of the movie there was one other bidder but i was determined to win this movie the losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy which i gave her despite owning a copy i still searched and searched finally finding a site that sold a dvd copy of the movie you can find it at httpwwwjohntoppingcomharvey20perrwar20widowwarwidowhtml,positive,1

this remake of the 1962 orginal filmo the book has some very good parts to commend it and some fine performances by some fine actors  however scorsese opts toward the end for the most formulaic of plot twists and an embarrassingly overacted shakespearean demise that had me looking at my watch  deniro is a superb actor dedicated to giving his all in the work he does however he needs direction to focus his talent and this is sorely lacking in the last five minutes of the film  gregory pecks cameo is serviceable but nothing more whilst robert michum is always fun to watch even with as few lines as this  nick nolte turns in a better performance than lorenzos oil but is not on the same form as weeds joe don baker has some great lines while juliette lewis proves yet again that talent sometimes skips a generation  some good points the start credits the first view of codys back when doing dips in the prison the scene where cody is attacked with baseball bats sam bowdens decent into fullfledged panic codys outwardly calm but unnerving prescence  the worst the cleaning woman  but not really part clinging barehanded to the underside of a car for a hundred miles at high speed are there no speed bumps in the us the hes dead  but not really parts and the aforementioned rambling ending  i may watch the original again but ive yet to be tempted to watch the remake in four years since seeing it,negative,0
staten island filmmaker andy milligan is well known in the horror community for being an even worse director than ed wood and with this as a dim example of his output im apt to agree with them in the ghastly ones we basically have three bickering couples traveling to their childhood home located on a conveniently secluded island to collect an inheritance there they are killed off one by one and the events unfold in murdermystery fashion with a scarred retard hunchback butler added to throw you for a loop the film is in such bad shape that it looks like someone just ran it through a dishwasher the sound is terrible the dialog is otherworldly bad theres some primitive mannequin gore plus some dismemberments and guts and its technically inept in every possible way it can be inept but is it enjoyable in a bad movie kind of way sort of its excruciating to watch but oddly entertaining in a train wreck fashion approach with caution if youre not a fan of horrible movies better deep six this one,negative,0
some will say this movie is a guilty pleasure i loved this flick but i dont feel guilty about it you can tell the whole cast and crew had fun making this movie but jack frost 2 wont go over well with some people right from the beginning you can tell this movie will be cheesy and it definitely has an amateurish look to it well if you get the privilege to watch this movie after watching it remember that jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman is a pleasure not a guilty pleasure now because i cant fill up ten lines heres some great scenes   spoilers   the three women on the beach had great deaths the first one had jack in a tree trying to drop icicles on one of them he kept missing so he dropped an anvil on her the next woman fell on a bed of icicles the last one was stabbed in the eyes with tongs  the other great one was where two surfers stoners are hanging out near a frozen pole one of them gets their tongue stuck on it of course jack frost pulls him back a rips his tongue off while saying cowatonguea dude well you have to see it for yourself  and of course the snowball children kicked ass  end spoilers  infinity stars,positive,1
i have never seen this in the theater my second viewing was tonight on big screen dvd as opposed to old vhs tape from rental store  saucey for its time and im sure the hayes code was pushed to its limits  hitchs pallet here is the game play between two combatants and yes if guy calls the cops on bruno right away the movie is 63 min shorter hello people do you always make the best or most logical choice how many times have you been in either persons shoes and made the right choice for the love of god its called poetic licensehowever as guy sees the situation he has found himself in he takes it upon himself to rectify it he does not solicit help nor does he lie to his would be new wife her defense of him sets off the final show down with bruno feeling he has one more card to play  for the cop shotting an innocent person in precam corder days and before rules of engagement this type of thing did happen in the post rodney king world a presidential candidate backed the police in sending 43 bullets at an unarmed man if you havent seen or witnessed outrageous police behavior your blind or have an application pending for the academeny  back to the movie  go watch it with try and wear a post wwii filter and pretend your seeing a great suspense movie like many did for the first time back then and sure its been copied since but your looking at one of the source of inspiration for many that followed,positive,1
i was looking forward to this so much being a big fan of the book however when it came out i remember thinking it was one of the biggest wastes of money and time ive ever spent at the cinema  in principle the acting the sets and the music were excellent and are the main reason why im rating this a 4  in this version sara is a little too selfsacrificing for my taste there is no way she would have deliberately lied to miss minchin just to stop her punishing the other girls in the book she makes a point of describing lies as not just wicked but vulgar   theres also far too much of a disneyfied ending for me saras father coming back from the dead and all of them trotting off into the indian sunset while the book does have a happy and critics might say equally improbable ending it doesnt leave you thinking oh puhleeze  about the only things true to the book were  1 saras father being a soldier 2 the lines between sara and her father are you learning me by heartno i know you by heart you are inside my heart 3 saras friendship with becky and her adopting lottie although this last one wasnt developed as much as it could have been 4 the changing of her room by adding various luxury items that part was brilliantly done 5 the basic core  a rich girl being flung into poverty suddenly  is there but thats about all that is  people might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience possibly all i can say to that is i have two cousins  aged 7 and 12 respectively  who were big fans of this film until they read the book  if all you want is a feelgood family film then this delivers if youre looking for a film that actually tells the story of a little princess in fact if youve read the book dont waste time with this one its such a shame with a cast like this if theyd stuck to at least the basic story it could have been fantastic  am i harping on about read the book this and read the book that a little too much very probably but if someone attempts to adapt a book  especially such a classic  into a movie then they should at least have done the same thing preferably more than once,negative,0

im serious as well i mean dont get me wrong if you havent got a bent for this type of z grade creaky creature feature why would you be watching is my first thought then its a rating of about 3 to 4 out of 10 tops but to me its a special kind of nonsense that takes me back to a nice time in my childhood you know the kind the memories that never leave you eagerly taking it all in with youthful wonderment as doug mcclure and peter cushing tunnel beneath the mantle to do battle with a host of creatures and subhuman species and guys now we are all grown up we can admire most seriously at the wonder of caroline munro and her heaving cleavage no wonder my older brother was keen to take me to the cinema to see this one  yes the effects are bad men in suits strings pinging parrot monsters around and exploding rubber frog like thingies amuse us greatly and yes cushing and a surprisingly pudgy mcclure act as if they have truly been mesmerised by the evil meyhas at the core of our film but it matters not zany and clunky and awash in glorious colour at the earths core is a throwback to a special preilm time when kids like me queued around the block to see such joyous nonsense 810,positive,1
a fantastic show and an unrealized classic the league of gentlemen remains as one of the greatest modern comedies of recent times  with a dark and bizarre style of humor that towers over the tired formulaic approach of its inferior yet unfortunately far more acknowledged successor little britain the league of gentlemen was truly something special during a rather quiet era in british comedy  up until its arrival on the scene there had never really been anything like the league of gentlemen before on the surface a seemingly simplistic sketch show the show soon unfolds as a vivid sinister but incredibly hilarious universe populated with all manner of brilliant comedic creations what really sets the show apart from its rivals is its approach to telling us its story rather than serve us rehashed sketches barely distinguishable from the next here we see each individual or group of characters go through their various journeys and story lines no visit to them is the same and each time they offer us up with a surprise  gradually over three series and a christmas special the fictional town of royston vasey is heaving with a grotesque yet hilarious populace and thats probably the main reason why the show is such a joy to watch and also the reason why the show would easily merit more series unlike other current shows like the catherine tate show or more importantly little britain the league both know when a character has run its course and have the opportunity to deal with that several fan favorites who could have easily been kept on to entertain further bowed out before the series came to a close giving room for fellow characters to grow more or allow for the introduction of newer residents of royston vasey to make their mark  another thing that sets this show above others is that the writing team approach the script process with care and intelligence as mentioned before all four members of the league have a sound mind when it comes to judging the longevity of their creations and when its time to call it quits in respect to certain characters this awareness has also meant the league of gentlemen undergoes a bold evolution not usually seen in a show of this nature the narrative driven and far darker third series is a brave step away from the more sketch based first two series and this bold move by the league really pays off with the third series theres less of an urgency for them to please an audience and like the christmas special they pursue individual stories with a clear narrative unlike the more sketchbased previous series that succesfully binded together various sets of sketches into a series long story arc  the third series is both a refreshing change of pace of style as well as a real treat for fans whove already seen the first two despite some polarized opinion on the third series any real fan of the league will appreciate what the third series has to offer as well as really enjoy the more character based episodes that only delve deeper into fan favorites but pair up and interwine characters that might not have crossed paths previously  it might take a little trying to get into the change in style but its definitely worth it and in my opinion the third series is the best and also provides a firm conclusion to the series  the shows not without its drawbacks and very occasionally certain characters and set pieces appear somewhat out of place but for the most part the genius writing dark nature of the show and the host of brilliant characters that are often all too close to real life make for a real treat and prove what comedy should be about and puts much of the more recent catch phrase driven and often desperate attempts at comedy to shame,positive,1

a group of us watched this film are were really disgusted we were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite character jo wasnt on its not like the writersproducers could do anything about that the writing was poor the script was subpar what really annoyed us 1 when the two guys realized they were both dating natalie they didnt just leave they put up with that stupid and ultimately degrading contest  but only because they were macho competing guys not because they really wanted natalie 2 despite being unable to choose between the two guys before the reunion natalie suddenly decides that she really loves one of the guys and is now ready to marry him and there was no foreshadowing that he was really a better guy its as if the writers flipped a coin and then just had her spit it out at some convenient point in the film 3 blair makes a point of talking about how she does not want children and then all of a sudden when her husband says he wants to have children she blissfully agrees with him,negative,0

rock solid giallo from a master filmmaker of the genre sergio martino fashioned from a marvelous screenplay by ernesto gestaldi this shocking mystery often develops fascinating twists until the terrific finale which most might not see coming throughout the film its when everything has fallen into place that we can go ahh the film revolves around the death of a husbandin an airplane explosionand the million dollars the wife receives from it there are those with great interest in that money one in particular being the dead mans mistress the wife is lisaida galliand the mistress demanding half the money is larajanine reynaud she tells lisa she knows that the death was arranged by her to get the insurance money lara says shell use her lawyer sharifluis barbooto get that money so already the film produces two possible suspects in the later murder of lisa who awaiting someone in tokyo george hilton portrays peter lynch peter works for a company that investigates those who gain inheritance to see if the pay day was gathered under suspicious means when on his watch lisa is killed by a man dressed from head to toe in black in her hotel room he is a possible suspect he decides to do a little investigating himself while also assisting inspector stavrosluigi pistilliand interpol agent bentontom felleghyon their quest to find a killer the killer strikes several times eliminating anyone revolving around the missing million dollars confiscated by the one responsible for the murder of lisa soon the film follows a journalist cléo dupontthe delicious luscious anita strindbergas she and peter meet for a dinner where she could try and sniff out anything that might break a story for her soon they fall deeply in love but it seems like anyone who is near peter is killed soon someone attacks cléo with an intent to kill which pushes the investigation further into uncharted territory why would anyone wish to harm a journalist with no real facts to damage the one killing off people  this giallo is quite clever and exciting to follow the film never lulls which is quite remarkable since so much happens leaving open the question of the identity of the killer this film follows the path of gialli with knife slashings because of a certain pattern the killer has takenthe throat and lower torso the films conclusion wraps up all the complex loose ends and is quite satisfying the film has some unique camera angles but delivers the goods in terms of driving the plot and the execution of the mystery,positive,1
this is a great german slasher thats often quite suspenseful and creative with a fun story and solid performances all the characters are cool and benno fürmann is great as the psycho killer plus franka potente gives a fantastic performance as the main lead it did take a little while to get going but it was never boring and it had some good death scenes as well plus the music is wonderfully creepy i was lucky enough to get the subtitled version instead of the dubbed and i thought all the characters were quite likable plus its very well made and written as well it has some really good plot twists too and the effects are extremely well done plus the ending is great the finale is especially suspenseful and franka potente was the perfect casting choice in my opinion plus i wish arndt schweringsohnreydavid didnt get killed of so soon because he was a really cool character there were actually a couple of moments where i felt uncomfortable but in a good way and i must say this film deserved all its praise plus while it does have plot holes its not enough to hamper the film this is a great german slasher thats often quite suspenseful and creative with a fun story and solid performances i highly recommend this one the direction is great stefan ruzowitzky does a great job here with excellent camera work very good angles great close ups see the opening sex scene doing a great job of adding creepy atmosphere and just keeping the film at a very fast pace  there is quite a bit of blood and gore we get cadavers cut openplenty of very gory surgery sceneslots of bloody stabbingspeople are dissected while still being conscious severed finger self mutilation guttings bloody slit throat lots of wicked looking frozen corpses plenty of blood and more  the acting is very solid franka potente is fantastic as the main lead she was very likable remained cool under pressure was vulnerable easy on the eyes and we are able to care for her character the only time she seemed to suffer was when she had to spurt out some bad dialog here and there but that wasnt very often she was wonderful benno fürmann is excellent as the psycho killer he was simply chilling and wonderfully ott he really gave me the creeps and was one effective killer anna loos played her role very well as the smart slut i dug her sebastian blomberg was great here as caspar he was quite likable and had a mysterious characterhis chemistry with potente was also on and there was a great twists involving him at the end holger speckhahn was good as the idiot phil and did his job well traugott buhre is good as prof grombek arndt schweringsohnrey was great as david he had a really cool character and i wish he didnt get killed of so soon rest of the cast do fine  overall i highly recommend this great german slasher 12 out of 5,positive,1

there is not much to add to what others have already commented the movie fails hard where it shouldnt it has no depth in the planning of the heist and the characters are so unbelievable  one thing that got me thinking was that although the rest of the gang is trying hard to remove the pins from the doors of an armored truck because there is supposed to be no other way of opening it the guy inside the truck with great ease manages to remove the floor of the truck which happens to have a hole in it so he can get out and then get back in without being noticed by anyone because no one else could think that he could get out from there or even better that they could have gotten into from there  promising but not quite there,negative,0
when i found out there was a movie that had both my favorite actresses meryl streep and wynona ryder i went through the roofbut i had a hard fall after watching this lame movie and i still have the bruisefirst of all the character that jeremy irons an actor i still admire even after this disappointmentplays was just awful he treated his family like crap especially his sister played by glenn close i could not get close or sympathize with any of the characters and im no prude but the sex scenes were really unnecessary or they could have been toned down wynona and antonios characters could have been developed a lot more and their romance could have been much more passionate and what was with meryls character and her mystical powers why didnt they go into this more this film had a lot of dead ends and the bottom line is that this is a really lousy movie and there was a lot of wasted talent here,negative,0
this is a straighttovideo movie so it should go without saying that its not going to rival the first lion king but that said this was downright good  my kids loved this but thats a given they love anything thats a cartoon the big shock was that i liked it too it was laugh out loud funny at some parts even the fart jokes had lots of rather creative tieins with the first movie and even some jokes that you had to be older to understand but without being risqué like in shrek do you think hes compensating for something  a special note on the fart jokes i was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just toilet noises in fact there were almost no noisesimagery at all the references were actually rather subtle they actually had a setuppunchlineetc and were almost in good taste id like my kids to think that theres more to humor than going to the bathroom and this movie is fine in those regards  hmm what else the music was soso not nearly as creative as in the first or second movie but plenty of fun for the kids no painfully corny moments which was a blessing for me a little action but nothing too scary the secret of nimh gave my kids nightmares not sure a g rating was appropriate for that one  all in all id say this is a great movie for kids of any age one thats 100 safe to let them watch i try not to be overly sensitive but ive had to jump up and turn off the tv during a few movies that were less kidappropriate than expected  but youre safe to leave the room during this one id say stick around anyway though you might find that you enjoy it too ,positive,1
ugh bad bad bad but i have seen worse which is why i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 just got finished watching this movie and i thought it was about as rotten as the flesh on dr choppers face the worst line of the movie had to be i like to introduce you to someone meet my inner btch which consisted of the lone survivor of the fantastic 5 group throwing a trash can at dr chopper and then falling on the stage second worst line im the park ranger thats gonna fck you up what this freak aint even a cop did anyone else notice how everyone instantly dies from the magic gut stab no one dies that quick from a gut stab i know this cause i see them frequently in the operating room except super park ranger dude had like a bucket of blood poor out of that wound writhes around on the floor some and then comes in for the finale to take a parting shot at dr chopper while inner btch lies cowering on the floor and if that dont beat all he doesnt even have the decency to die then like everyone else inner btch helps him limp outside and proceeds to tell him not to die while she runs for help cause hes like her only friend left alive now since when did these two become friends i dont think a frantic meeting in the woods where he tells you to head for the city qualifies as getting to know you time but whatever   only watch this movie if theres nothing else own and you have nothing else to do with your time,negative,0
this movie strikes me as one of the most successful attempts ever at coming up with plausible answers for some of the nagging questions that have cropped up in recent scholarship concerning the passion suffering and death of christ accounts in the new testament what motivated judas if money was not the issue what could bring the sanhedrin to meet on a high holy day why did pilate waffle it is a movie for the serious thinking christian fans of the passion of the christ will no doubt be disappointed by the lack of gory spectacle and arch characterization as for myself i find the portrait painted hereof the willingness of ordinary people to so blithely sacrifice common decency when their own selfinterest is at stakefar more realistic and deeply unsettling the disinterested just doing my job look on the face of the man who drives the first nail in christs wrist is as chilling as any moment in film the film makes no claim to authenticity but the settings and costuming invariably feel more right than many more highly acclaimed efforts it is a slow film but if you accept its selfimposed limits it is after all the deathnot the lifeof christ ultimately a very rewarding one,positive,1
by dane youssef  a gang of crooks the perfect plan it all goes wrong theyre in trouble the police are outside theyre cornered what are they gonna do now  sound familiar  the movie seems like its trying to be a combination of the acting workshop the indie film and the theater  its the kind of things that actors loveits kind of like a workshop or a play because it mostly consists of tight focusing on the actors acting acting angry tense scared conversing scheming planninggiving the performers a lot of free range to really ham it all up  a trio of crooks one leader one goon one brother come up with a big heist scheme and a monkey wrench is thrown into the works to top things off theres a bit of a fenderbender and one of the crooks in flung through the back of the windshield  the cops are on their tail and they stumble into a bar named poetically and leadenly dinos last chance  spacey as a director tries to keep the focus on the actors performances and delivery of dialouge he pans over to a bright passionred cigarette ad of a smoking and smoldering bogart and he keeps all the violence offscreen really  i think that was a mistake focusing on the intensity and gruesome violent scenes would have given the movie some edge  the problem with the movie is that it moves too slow and suffers from miscasting in almost every role matt dillon drugstore cowboy and wild things seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang  gary sinese seems to brooding and deep in thought to be a spineless tagalong with these guys and joe mantaga is effective as the traditional routine foulswearing maddog police lieutenant whos all thumbs but he isnt given anything to really do here  william fischter is the only actor who is believable in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to spill blood  and the crooks are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or they try to think of some way out of this  spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going the characters are mostly chatting away trying to think of a plan and theyre to calm and too articulate theres even a scene where the crooks are playing pool with a whole swarm of armed cops right outside ready to strike at one point one of the crooks even call the police who are right outside the bar oh brother oh bother  these cops are going to either blow them away or going to lock them up shouldnt the holedup crooks be a little scared a little uneasy meanwhile all the real action is happening inside  someone whips out a gun a baseball bat which leads to an ugly confrontation offscreen and theres one more casualty that happens thats well kinda sad but  faye dunaway also should have spent more time with a dialect coach improving on her new orleans accent skeet ullrich is fine in a smaller part  a cop listening in reaches for a pack of matches at the absolute worst time is a nice look and so is a scene where someone goes right through the rear windshield   the dialouge is obviously trying to go for a david mamet approach and its as profane but never as realistic or as insightful  the movie feels like too much of what it really is a really lowbudget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script thats not bad but needs a few more rewrites spacey shows hes not a terrible director but he lacks a sort of feel for shaping a movie and it feels like hes just filming actors act  these actors are all talented and could work with the material but they all feel out of place as i said before the movie really suffers from miscasting   i dont mean that the wrong actors were cast i think they found just the right cast but placed them in all the wrong roles i think switching some of the roles wouldve helped immensely  having veteran mob actor joe mantagna play the leader of the pack gary sinese as the angry police lieutenant outside on his bullhorn giving orders and barking at his troops keeping fischter in his bloodthirsty goon part and matt dillion as the sacrificial lamb that would have been a big improvement  when some actors direct it works they can even win oscars for it but a lot of the time when actors direct they have a tendency to just focus on the performances just shoot the actors acting  sometimes it works but they need a good showcase for it an excuse for it  hostage situations are all pretty much the same in real life just like comingofage stories so its only natural that movies about them will go from point a to point b as well  there are a few really great entries into this genre spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations the negotiator  this certainly wont become a cult classic let alone one of afis 100 still it does have a few nice moments and personal touches but in the end its instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on regular tv its just not worth going out of your way to see  i give a 3 out of 10   spaceys other directorial credit beyond the sea was reportedly a better effort hmmm maybe its true you need to fail before you succeed  by dane youssef,negative,0
i dont understand why some of you or many have given this film upward of 8 stars out of 10 do you understand that there are lower ratings for a reason sure this may be a zombie flick with some splatter but thats it im not a hater on zombie films but this was awful really actually i should call it more like a zombiesoap because thats how the acting is production is well okay barely an attempt at plot development awful acting silly effects clichés and an abrupt ending go ahead and like zombie movies but dont ever give this above a 50 honestly though the only reason you should want to watch this movie is to laugh seriously,negative,0
this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen branaugh seemed to have so much trouble remembering his accent that he couldnt deliver his lines the plot was definitely not worthy of john grishams name no wonder it was never published as a book or released in theaters i didnt even watch the whole thing i decided i didnt care who done it then realized there was no whodunit to care about,negative,0
thankfully brief mystery about a telephone operator who is discovered to be the kidnapped daughter of a railroad tycoon the discovery brings about an attempt on her life which is foiled by charlie ruggles as a crime deflector things take a turn for the dangerous when everyone ends up in the title location and another attempt is made on the girls life your enjoyment of this film will depend upon your tolerance for rugggles and his nonsensei normally like ruggles but there was something about this role that rubbed me the wrong way actually i think it didnt help that the mystery wasnt very good so there was nothing beyond the characters to keep you watching yes the finale on the train was exciting but it didnt make up for everything that went before not worth searching out but if you stumble upon it give it a try,negative,0

okay let me start off by saying that on the whole i dont like anime very much ive enjoyed a couple of the oftcited classic series but regard the medium as a whole in exactly the same way that i do american television namely that a good 9095 of it is utter tripe with the remainder falling anywhere from watchable to decent this being the case its no wonder that i dont like the selfdeprecating anime parodies out there i dont get most of the jokes and the medium itself enforces a certain style of humor that doesnt appeal to me at all  loud hyperactive lowbrow and completely over the top  so when i started watching this series at the behest of a friend i was primed for disappointment after the first couple of episodes i figured that the characters were supposed to represent cliché characters from shopworn story outlines and that their actions were supposed to be similarly satirical i could kind of see where it was coming from but didnt think that it was all that clever  lots of wacky funfilled highschool shenanigans and goingson only now were being ironic about it at about the third episode my opinion drastically changed  it was at that point that the strengths of this series started to manifest themselves the quirks of the nonchronological episode order its snarky sense of selfawareness and above all clever humor with gasp a wellexecuted straight man  in what i consider to be a rarity in any medium this show presents wellthought out witty interactions between diametrically opposed characters protagonist kyons perpetual sense of vaguely annoyed resignation provides the perfect foil to the actions of title character haruhis generic animelike exploits its a break from formula and it works incredibly well  based on that strong foundation the series further succeeds with a truly phenomenal level of attention to detail as previously stated the episodes air out of chronological order i considered this to be a gimmick at first but it works surprisingly well the chronological sequence of events makes sense logically but the aired order of the episodes more closely follows the traditional structure of aristotelian drama the order chosen leaves no narrative gaps that cannot be filled by simple inference but while it is possible to guess what happened in an unaired preceding episode one still feels compelled to watch exactly how those events unfold and superb planning prevents any plot holes or contradictions i watched this series a second time immediately upon completing it the first time and i was amazed at how well even seemingly inconsequential events were all tied together  the last point is indicative of the extreme attention to detail in every area of the series while the stock anime character designs grate a bit the background art is exquisite realistically rendered based upon actual photographic references animation quality is also excellent at important points for example there is a musical performance late on in the series in which the characters are shown actually playing a song  this may sound trivial but the subconscious effect of watching filmquality animation which actually corresponds to the soundtrack is incredible  in short i love this series for some reason by its very nature it is something that i generally dislike but its execution is so unique and wellcarried out that i cant help it,positive,1
i found it a real task to sit through this film the sound track was not the best and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what was being said there was little to move the plot along and often the action simply stopped and there was a prolonged period of conversations which seemed extraneous to the movie these conversations switched between family groups and the observer was left to try and piece together what the common thread was that tied them together it is rare that i rate a film this low and do so in this case as the entire viewing experience left me thinking so what and why did i waste my time watching this,negative,0
so far i disliked every single jean rollin movie ive seen and that always bothered me because hes an acclaimed eurotrash monument and extremely popular amongst many regular reviewers on this lovely website people whose opinions i always value and usually concur with apparently everybody always appears to pinpoint some sort of gloomy and stylistic filming trademarks in his work that are completely lost on me rollins movies are unimaginably boring they all feature the same basic concept lesbian vampires in various settings the dialogs are incredibly absurd the marvelous gothic setting are always underused and the production values are cheaper than the price of a bus ticket i had actually given up on rollins repertoire already especially after enduring the iron rose until i found out about night of the hunted allegedly this movie doesnt feature any lame lesbian vampires and stands as a bona fide horror movie with gruesome killings and macabre plot twists and the verdict is  yes and no on one hand this is undeniably the most compelling and inventive rollin film i had the pleasure of seeing thus far and also the only one that i watching without dozing off on the other hand it still remains a moronic movie with a nonsensical plot and emotionless sex sequences to compensate for the dullness jean rollin heavily attempts to generate an atmosphere of secrecy and suspense mostly through a lack of information and vaguely introduced characters but barely manages to hide the fact he actually hasnt got a story to tell at all the unearthly beautiful lead actress brigitte lahaie and the beautifully ominous musical guidance are the only elements that keep you hooked on the screen during a nightly drive back home to paris a young man abruptly has to stop for a confused and scarcely dressed girl who comes running from the woods her name is elisabeth but furthermore she cant remember anything about herself and from what or whom she was running away her case of amnesia is so bad she even continuously forgets who picked her up the next day shes kidnapped again by an old guy and taken to a sinister apartment complex where multiple people in the same bizarre mental state are held captive elisabeth knows nothing but she does sense she needs to escape from here obviously i wont reveal the denouement but i can assure you it is quite dumb illogical and farfetched apparently rollin realized this as well because the explanation is kept very brief and quick theres a large number of overly weird and senseless sequences the sex footage is dire and filmed without passion the nasty makeup effects look cheap and randomly thrown without actual purpose as said the score is mesmerizing and brigitte lahaies perfect body is addictive to glaze at,negative,0
a somewhat typical bit of filmmaking from this era obviously it was first conceived into this world for the stage but nonetheless a very good film from beginning to end peter otoole and susannah york get to do their stage performance act for the silver screen and both do it effectively there is very little in the way of story and anyone not familiar with this type of off beat character study may be a little put off by it all in all though a good film in which peter otoole and susannah york get to overact,positive,1
first of all the big named actors must need the money the surgical scenes were laughable and surely they must know that people who have a little knowledge of medicine would find this utterly absurdanesthesiologists do not leave the room during a heart transplantnor do they do the surgery in a tiny room devoid of instruments heart lung equipment and sterile techniques just a joke couldnt concentrate on the story line because of all the stupid surgery scenes no blood no personnel and then the hero doc coming in and taking over it is not a film for thinking adultsalso the budget must have been limited the street scenes were ok but who was the technical adviserseems like it was directed by a total idiot save your money and wait until it comes out on dvd and dont rent it,negative,0
this film has been scaring me since the first day i saw it  my mum had watched it when it was on the telly back in 92 i remember being woken up in the middle of the night by her tearful ramblings as my dad helped her up the stairs  she was saying something like dont let her get me or something like that i asked what had made her so upset and she told me that shed been watching the woman in black  so obviously i had to watch it and even though i was only eleven she let me it scared the s out of me ive been immune to horror films since watching this,positive,1
after watching revolt of the zombies starring future academy award winner dean jagger i was left with one burning question how was a society that created these ultimate warrior fighting machines ever defeated in the first place   thats the question youll be pondering if you take time to watch revolt of the zombies towards the end of world war i the french discover a cult from occupied cambodia where these undead creatures who cannot be stopped with bullets form a brigade of monks who go over the top and dislodge the hun  this scares the living fecal matter out of everyone concerned so an international expedition is formed to find out destroy the secret of these zombies so no nation can get their hands on it and rule the world  but weve got some dissent in those ranks first is snidely whiplash villain roy darcy who murders the buddhist monk who has the secret and second is dean jagger power is the ultimate aphrodisiac as we all know and hes determined to woo dorothy stone away from rival robert noland  i think youve got some idea how this comes out especially since a race of zombies didnt conquer the world for one country dean jagger as he got the oscar for twelve oclock high must have shuddered every time he thought about this film and the awful dialog he tried to give a spark of sincerity to  moral of the story you might make an ultimate warrior with the zombie potion and the zombie chant but you cant make an ultimate love slave,negative,0
from the stupid quaint african natives travelogue footage with our badlysuperimposed principals acting as narrators to the horrible fake ears which transform docile indian elephants into african elephants to the utter lack of any logic at all to maureen osullivans incessant whining of tarzan tarzan there is nothing about this movie which deserves classic status  410,negative,0
ship ahoy was probably made in order to showcase mgm talent the film is a fun trip on an ocean liner on its way to san juan puerto rico at the time in which the country was involved in wwii this was typical fare for the studios which gave the movie going public light weight entertainment as a distraction during those difficult times the country was living  the beautiful eleanor powell is seen at her best in some musical numbers where she clearly shows us she was a dancer to be reckoned with red skelton is also seen in a straight part with not too much clowning as he pursues the beautiful ms powell on the ship that is bringing them to puerto rico the irresistible bert lahr has good opportunities in the film to show he was a funny man also virginia grey is seen as a fun girl who is not fooled by anyone  there are good musical numbers featuring tommy dorsey and his orchestra in which one sees among others the amazing buddy rich who has a few solos with mr dorsey and ms powell a young frank sinatra appears also as the lead singer of the band backed by the pied pipers  this is a nostalgic trip that should be savored by fans of this genre which mgm totally controlled,positive,1
when i was young i was a big fan of chuck norris i just begun getting out all his old movies on video so i can see them through adult eyes i remember that i really liked this one in particular and thought it was one of his best now that im a little older i can say that although its thoroughly average i still consider it one of his better films in an acting stretch for him norris plays a cop haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie serial killers are all the rage nowadays and people would like to think of them as a wholly 90s invention in contrast its good to see where the current infatuation has sprung from most obviously action movies as well as stalk n slashers of 70s and 80s while norris attempts at both humour and any form of human compassion are hamfisted and laughable nobody could kick someone in the head quite like chuck being a big fan of steve james also i can recommend this film ditto for genre legend billy drago as well as seeing mitch from the blue brothers in a supporting role not great but its better than anything norris did in the 90s,negative,0

i havent seen this film in years but the awful taste of quaids performance still lingers on my tongue some have commented on how quaid has jerry lee lewis to a tee but the fact is he only appears to have the most extreme stage jerry in mind nobody acts that way all the time and the performance comes off as hopelessly clownish reducing lewis to a buffoonish caricature the nuances of a mans life are lost in the rubble of sheer overacting  the author of the book this is based on nick tosches is a good writer who has written several fine musical bios i particularly liked dino on dean martin in the books tosches gives us a full human being both separate from and involved in the biz quaids acting seems to imply that jerry never acted like a human being if people were like this no one would bother to hang around them as cartoons go it is mildly amusing but otherwise it is one of the most egregious filmdestroying performances i have had the honor of viewing terrible,negative,0
as a fan of notorious big i was looking forward to this movie i am unfortunate to see it is a terrible movie jamal woodward is not convincing or realistic enough to portray notorious big a lot of the story follows notorious bigs real son christopher jordan wallace as notorious big as a kid unfortunately he is not convincing enough to pay tribute to his father derek luke is just as unconvincing as sean puffy combs in a nutshell no one is convincing enough to play their roles here the big problem with this are these are actual people they are playing it was boring and did not give any information about notorious big that fans and nonfans alike did not already know i was especially disappointed with angela bassett a very good actress wasted here as voletta wallace the movie slugs and slugs along thinking that notorious big fans will spend tons of money on it i am unfortunate to say that that happened its nowhere close to a good movie i was expecting so much out of it but unfortunately i didnt get anything i wanted from this i think you should definitely skip this one,negative,0
largely forgettable tale in which mercenary kerman  employer agren travel into the jungle in search of agrens missing sister  despite its connection to the cannibal movie family this film is more of an extreme version of rene cardonas guyana  crime of the century lenzi clearly aims to exploit the at that time topical jonestown massacre by depicting a rogue self righteous zealot with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania played with ruthless intensity by ivan rassimov leading his motley crew flock into self inflicted oblivion with sister in toe kerman  agren attempt to stop the rot but after several failed coups they end up fleeing into the green inferno only to run afoul the locals and their notorious appetites  one in a string of excessive gore fests that emerged in the late seventiesearly eighties where every new addition seemed to engage in a oneupmanship contest with its predecessor by attempting to contrive the most gory and graphic display ever brought to motion pictures this inferior instalment employs all the motifs and gimmicks of the others but with much less success  was it the so called amazonian natives who looked like they were bollywood rejects this film was made on location in sri lanka or the inept decapitation and castration scenes that seriously diminished the authenticity that was apparent in cannibal holocaust you can decide without spoiling the conclusion it appeared as though lenzi put more emphasis in his shock and awe climax than in the basic requirement for a cohesive ending where all loose ends are resolved most unsatisfying  as with the others where the extent of the graphic depictions of violence toward humans is limited thankfully the filmmakers have spared no extreme in inflicting the worst possible cruelty on hapless animals in their pursuit of the most sadistic shocks unfortunately the only thing shocking about this film is that it rates a mention among others of the ilk that deal with the subject matter more convincingly  if there are any redeemable features at all kerman is an affable if somewhat onedimensional leading man and his bevy of scantily clad costars agren lai and senatore provide some visual respite from the relentless slayings,negative,0
i first read pearl s bucks splendid novel in my ninth grade history class and i enjoyed every thrilling page of it it was almost inevitable that hollywood would get hold of it and considering that it was made in 1937 the results are excellent  certain things have to be accepted in 1937 there was no question of casting asian actors in a major hollywood film in a way this renders the end product rather more interesting than if they had been able to use a more authenticlooking cast  with that obstacle to overcome executive producer irving thalberg and director sidney franklin among others took the trouble to handpick a splendid and stellar cast paul muni plays wang lung muni was at the peak of his powers as an actor during this period and could very nearly play anything he put his mind to once you get past the makeup its good but no one is going to really mistake him for a chinese man his performance has all the verisimilitude of his best work  then there is luise rainer coming off an oscar win the previous year for her performance in the great ziegfeld the viennese actresss star was on the rise and she was given the plum role of olan despite her lack of experience in hollywood her performance won her a second consecutive oscar the first time in history that happened  much criticism has been leveled at rainers performance and her oscar win here she has been called wooden and onenote there is a small grain of truth in that however that being said all you need to do is go back to the book for rainer though not chinese played olan pretty much as buck wrote her it is in fact a splendid performance and one of the best transfers from book to screen i have ever witnessed  as for the rest of the cast well this was mgm they had the biggest roster of stars and character actors in hollywood at the time and a big budget to pay for the best and in the end they got the best  the film softens wang lungs marriage to olan somewhat in the novel with wealth come the lusts of the flesh and he takes on a concubine a move which devastates his wife but her feelings as a mere woman do not concern him in the film a contrite wang lung returns to his wife on her deathbed the two pearls he had taken from her years before realizing too late that she was his true love  corny yes but thats hollywood considering the obstacles they were up against the film might well have opened to screams of laughter but despite the noticeable dearth of real asians in the cast this film has worn surprisingly well with the passage of seventythree years in fact the most amazing thing about this film is how good it is when it might so easily have been a disaster,positive,1

is a big struggle as a story that is surreal this movie couldve been great as great as it is rated by some here but mixed with the acting director and relatives playing major roles due to financial reasons i reckon found in here  although calling this acting is not only a stretch of that word its giving it a new meaning a whole new meaning   if you are into surreal movies there are some that i do like actually see the japanese strange circus for example you might be able to overlook the flaws see above and enjoy this more there are great ideas here after all many great metaphors and ambiguous scenes but while watching this with a group of friends almost all of us just couldnt stop laughing  not the intention of the director of course again everyone has their own liking as one can see by the high rating of this movie but i could only recommend the movie if youre aware of the work that alejandro jodorowsky has done andor are a fan of his,negative,0
first off let me say i have wanted to see this movie for about a year now because i knew angelina jolie was in it and i love her but my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the movie anyhow no video stores carried it but low and behold the local library did i watched it and absolutely loved it yes there were italian stereotypes but it was done well and funny it was not degrading in any way  every actor and actress did a superb job i laughed very hard at the sexual humor overall i think this movie is well worth seeing if you can find it it is adorable and just plain fun to watch i rarely rank movies as a 10 but i give this one a 10  go find it and watch it,positive,1

edward furlong and christina ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma featured in this movie  this is the typical alternative or indie movie with a plot that features a rare situation that suddenly becomes really important  pecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is to take photographs of the exotic habitants of the small town where he lives in suddenly an alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him in order to expose his work in some important festivals and more  but pecker life changes drastically as now fortune and fame seem to infuriate the towns people who are peckers main inspiration even his sexy girlfriend gets mad because now he does not pays the adequate attention to her  well this is an indie movie with an edge but not for everyone it may seem boring or pretentious for some people but still i think it worths a watch only because it offers something different than hollywoods typical standards  to describe in a few words this is the typical christina ricci and john waters movie thats it  oh and i almost forgot to mention that the full of grace lines are really annoying geez,positive,1
three teenage girls in an incomplete triangular relation the base of the triangle is barely there at the apex is marie a serious short and lean tomboy with a belmondolike facial structure her best friend is the physical and psychological opposite coquette chubby  i dare say fat  and desirous for her first kiss with a boy but not quite ready for her first sexual encounter because of her chubbiness boys dont seem interested and it pains her  the other leg of the apex is a beautiful fille fatale blonde vamp she is deeply involved in the sport of synchronized swimming performing at competitive level marie sees her during a competition at the local public swimming pool marie insinuates herself into the life of the vamp using the desire to become a synchronized swimmer as an argument the vamp has a reputation of being a whore making out with any young male that orbits around her marie is not phased out by that reputation put a stress on reputation  the first half is set up we get to see a lot of synchronized swimming as we become familiar with the three girls eventually the narrative leaves synchronized swimming behind and concentrates on the topsyturvy relations among the three thats when unexpected things start to happen  it is a trademark of french films to drop nuggets of wisdom on the viewer this one is no exception here it is about ceilings and the dying see the film to learn more  the director says that the use of synchronized swimming is purposeful that womenonly sport is a metaphor for a girls life pretty and feminine on the surface while hard working and competitive underneath a number of scenes drive this point elegant moves and smiles for the public legs kicking ungainly underwater the title in french is also suggestive prieuve or octopus suggest an individual having to juggle many pressures simultaneously,positive,1
watching cbss surrender dorothy i kept wondering why diane keaton would want to be in it not because its a television moviewith the dearth of enticing roles for slightly older actresses it isnt any wonder why academy award winning performers such as keaton turn to tvbut because it offers no opportunities for keaton to shine a single mother grieving the sudden death of her twentysomething daughter imposes uponand gradually becomes friends withthe group of young people her daughter was close to at the time of her accident adapted from the novel this teleplay gives us a group of selfabsorbed characters one would cross the street to avoid aside from being coarse and dim these phony people are incredibly unconvincing as is the tidy scenario and the bungalow near the beach where the kids reside one young man who wears muscle shirts to tell us hes gay hears diane keaton say surrender dorothy and actually asks thats from the wizard of oz rightno genius its from citizen kane keaton may have wanted to do this material based on the subject matter of confronting death she tries turning this distinctly unlikable woman into a shadow of her own personage lots of kooky outfits but it doesnt sit well with the viewer since keaton has always been warmly likable and flexible in a flaky way here shes a crazed harpy who doesnt learn many lessons on her journey of selfdiscovery the movie quickly forgets its about a dead young woman and becomes an odyssey for the nervous wreck of a mom who appears to be an overage hippie who has never lost anyone close to her this is the kind of film actors promote on talk shows with the caveat it should help a lot of grieving mothers out there i cant imagine it helping anyone since it is intrinsically a downer muddled and baffling its deranged,negative,0
i feel like i have some uberrare disease that no one has heard of and i have finally come across a support group on the net i finally found this title by asking for an answer on an experts site on the web i too saw this movie in my youth and was struck by the atmosphere and especially the ending i have never forgotten it and have never seen it since no one i know saw the film and i had almost given up on ever finding its title alas even knowing the name i shall probably never see the film again as it is impossible to find commercially small steps  g,positive,1
i want so badly to give this piece of garbage a zero unfortunately there isnt so i had to give it a 1 just to warn you about how stupidly terrible this imposter of a familiar cartoon really is the characters look like they were drawn by preschoolers no wait ive seen preschoolers do better i prefer misadventures of flapjack to this terrible excuse for a cartoon im probably saying what others have said two words rip off remember that episode of dexters lab when they raced gokarts down that volcano yeah mister fellows even cashed in on that idea and failed they even ripped off shadow lugia in that one episode that parodied pokemonhe even cashed in on that franchise that one character is a cheap rip off of mandark from dexters lab mister fellows needs to be sued for statutory infringement for this piece of crap everyone has their own opinion but those of you who like johnny ripoff test youre just lying to yourselves do yourself a favor change the channel when this rip off tries to disgrace your screen,negative,0
and i love it wonder showzen will pick up a cult audience and once its canceled the dvd sales will go though the roof this is a very funny show in its own ways its a parody of childrens shows namely sesame street our puppet characters consist of chauncy a yellow furry monster with a hat whose our host clarence is a blue lizard like thing that does his own segments where he goes out on the streets him is a weird dog like thing that refers to himself in the third person wordsworth is the smart one whose brain always shows then theres the newscaster and the pink puppet its a very funny show not really as nasty as youd expect but more the situations they take 7 year olds out on the street tell them what to say and have them make mean jokes that they dont understand my favorite segments are clarences videos especially when somebody doesnt want to be filmed i prefer tv funhouse which was a similar show but this is still a very funny show that i hope lasts for years to come  my rating  14 out of  30 mins tv ma,positive,1
maybe the best part of the show is the fact that it creeps up right after conan obrien and late nights fans are all of a sudden unsuspectingly watching carsons show carson daly cant hold a candle to leno letterman obrien or any other late night talk show host and last call seems to miss more than hit in this hit and miss genre the shows only redeeming quality is that its so short but i wouldnt call it crap carson daly is sincere and doesnt hide the fact that his show isnt greatthat honesty is actually helpful here while some of last calls skits and material seem to be stolen they still find the mark sometimes actually some of carsons montages have been quite entertaining and the skits occasionally have their moments of decent comedy  as an interviewer carson is okay even with only one guest not exactly late night material but still above the level attained by a high school av team however he doesnt have the quick wit that makes conan so hilarious i do not like his musical guests but thats more because i am not a fan of that kind of music so im not holding it against him  on to the house band i dont know joe firstmans band and wouldnt compare them to the cbs orchestra the tonite show band with kevin eubanks or the max weinberg 7 even cleeto and the cleetones are better but firstmans band mates do still the show in my opinion especially the alto sax player that sometimes shows up he has long dark hair and sunglasses and is always playing in the upper register if anything watch the show for him i do  in summary this show isnt even worth a full bag of kibble n bits but it does have an audience and appeals more to the younger mtv generation if you dont have cable and are up at 137 am there really isnt much more to choose from and surprise surprise there is worse out there in that time frame so if youre waiting for poker after dark to come on 30 minutes of last call wont kill you during the wait,negative,0
this is a betterthanaverage entry in the saint series  it holds your interest and as mysteries should keeps you guessing until the end and has several suspects to choose from  many films from the golden age are not for all tastes especially younger viewers they date themselves by clothing cars settings etc who nowadays asks for a highball or wears a suit and tie everywhere and the legal process was so much simpler  must have been a dearth of lawyers back then frankly much of value is missing from those days  in any case go with it and enjoy its good  in an oldfashioned sense,positive,1
i am so glad that i got a chance to see this rare little gem of a movie i saw it at an independent film festival so dont expect it to come to your town anytime soon during the film i noticed about 10 people get up and walk out too bad for them down here in the south folks dont like having to read subtitles the movie starts out slow but is so rich in dialogue that i never felt bored when the action finally arrives i found myself glued to the screen as if i were riding a roller coaster  i also got a big kick of the chapter titles appearing before the chapters especially the ones that introduce the characters as they appear on screen it reminded me of zelda ocarina of time when you face level bosses  if this is the future of video gamecomic book movies then i welcome it,positive,1
oh my god after having such a promising start critters 2 reiterated the karmic rule of what goes around comes around clearly very few things were thought out when this movie was made and what was up with scott grimes wearing an earing this should have been the last expedition into the critters saga but more garbage was on its way this was the big reason why i didnt watch critters 3 and why is every bad film series has to have an episode in space critters friday the 13th leprechaun in space hellraiser etc,negative,0
i wont waste your time by describing the plot for this the other reviewer already did this quite well i will however give you my opinion of this movie this movie is basically anti japanese propoganda the japanese are portrayed as incredably evil btards who have respect for nothing as well as having very poor martial arts skills groups of japanese men get there asses kicked by single women on more than one occasion the fact that the japanese fighters lose almost every if not every fight in the movie kind of takes away the suspense the plot is actually quite solid and perfect for a kung fu movie though the problem lies in the fact that theres not much fighting when there are fights some of the fighting is quite good but other scenes are choreographed badly one scene angela mao takes on six japanese in a church and kicks all their asses the problem is they show her fighting them one by one when theyre all supposed to be attacking at the same time i gather this movie was incredably cheap considering how cheap some of the sets are they use the same village set for when they are in korea and when they are in china without changing it at all some scenes are filmed at real locations though and they look good overall the only real problem with the movie is its slow moving and uninteresting plot since there are few fight scenes we have to rely on the plot for entertainment and well i wasnt entertained  one and a half stars out of four,negative,0
i saw this movie at the philadelphia film festival today and enjoyed it overall it is an interesting and adept analysis of the alltoocommon revelation that our parents marriage was more flawed and difficult than we originally imagined in addition this movie is an excellent example of process of discovering truths about our parents lives after their death and the issues associated with that however i found the sound quality recording and editing to be relatively poor and annoying  it may very well have been related to the specific theater and projection conditions  i am not a film maker  student or anything and claim no real understanding of the sound production process but as a consumer i found the audio portion of the movie distracting specifically i heard very unpleasant lip smacking noises through out especially one long interview with the younger sister the film and often the background noise level was higher in volume than peoples voices for example the scene when a small group was sorting through the mothers papers has anyone else seen this movie noticed anything about the sound thanks,positive,1
when the movie the cure starts we find out about a young man named erik brad renfro erik is a teenage boy living with his paranoid mother and living next door to him is a young boy named dexter joseph mazello one day erik and dexter connect and head up to the supermarket where dexter gets his first taste of butterfinger when erik learns out that dexter has aids he tries leavesandwater tea to make it better but when the front cover of the national enquirer says a new orleans doctor has found the cure for aids the two boys will stop at nothing to get to new orleans for the cure  in my opinion the cure is easily one of the best friendship movies ever made it shows unconditional love between a boy his new best friend and his best friends mom everything is so well done nothing needs to be changed not only do i give this a 1010 for being a fantastic friendship movie but it also is a sad but humorous and fun aids movie and the tragic finale with dexters contraction of aids is enough to make me shed a tear very well done,positive,1
 the best bit  when the dull mobster nicholas turturro calls out to the runaway matthew modine shane  come back shane  and when the older wise guy asks him what are you doing  he replays simply enjoying my time  actually like me at the moment     the most creepy part  ive been wondering all the time of watching  where did i see that girl before  where  where  till i found out while the closing credits ohh my god  shes elizabeth berkley  from the showgirls fiasco  but i just couldnt recognize her with her clothes on  to tell you the truth i felt a brief tremor shes really cute and nice but maybe hollywood had no mercy at all     the most sexy bit  when berkley says do you mean the stuff which gives you a boner     the most dull thing  the retarded assistant after a day and a night in the back of the car is still alive and healthy at the end  moreover the mexican smuggler took 3 bullets at the same car  and hes not dead either     the most ugly thing  all of those murdered people as well as the numerous f ward to a boring extent     the most beautiful thing  the crazy clever script with all the funny characters and the tumultuous situations the acting looked sweet also especially from paul rodriguez who stole the show for as he had the best dialogue also     the most disappointing thing  although the direction didnt mess about the storys wittiness at all but in the same time it didnt give it a unique touch a matchless signature some kind of insane hilarity like the one in the story itself however maybe the low production wronged it well  and of course the easy tasteless music which could be like that because of cheap production too     the most confusing part  matthew modine is a talented guy but what did he do exactly to be out of hollywoods a list of stars  what could possibly be the thing he made or didnt make  to end up in light independent jest like the shipment     the most absent scene  where did jose the mexican smuggler go at last  i thought that well see him again at the end smuggling once more as the surviving little criminal who in a brief gimmick like this could materialize the continuous disorder of such a world    the most question i had after the end  when well see the shipment  2  as im so eager to see that fine small comic hurlyburly atmosphere again    these were my own answers if you interested in giving answers of your own for this questionnaire please email me,positive,1
the riddle as a concept is an interesting idea but im afraid is miscast vinnie if given the hard man role is his element as in lock stock and snatch in this movie vinnie plays a newspaper sports writer greyhounds to be precisewho during the course of the movie is easily is beaten up with ease and bundled over a balcony by a man who 1015 years his senior im sorry vinnie is tough looks tough and has so to cast him like this is foolish trying to investigate the double murders of a friend and a drug addict found near the thames he takes on the role of policeman whilst the real police are bit part players interceeding with flashbacks from charles dickens  when vinnie is on screen his reputation precedes him he looks tough but doesnt in this part need act tough snarling at the camera in parts if you watch the mean machine he is perfectly cast and believable and does a very decent performance   getting back to the movie what confuses the matter somewhat is the flashback to charles dickens who is narrating a different story with characters who are also appear in present day these two stories are it appears unrelated apart from the same actors are used   the sound on the movie especially from julie cox is inaudible at times and not really fleshed out what her role in the movie is short of vinnies love interest she starts the film as a detecive but quickly becomes the girlfriend  the death of the prostitute is sort of answered but yetnot answered  strip out the charles dickens stuff and you may have a decent movie  vinnie is slowly becoming britans steven segal stick to the supporting actor role youre quite good at it,negative,0
well i must admit when i saw the trailer for this movie i was looking forward to it i am generally a fan of light hearted romantic comedies and from the trailer thats the impression i got of this movie however i spent most of the movie waiting for the comedy to begin although there were a couple of amusing scenes in general the outlook of the movie was quite depressing  i also found it difficult to fall in love with any of the characters as they all seemed a little underdeveloped the time which the director could have used exploring the characters taken up by a needless overuse of opera making the movie feel dragged out and slow  all in all although there are some touching scenes the trailer is quite deceptive and i would only suggest you go watch this if there is really nothing else that tickles your fancy  not fantastic and as i have said before bland,negative,0
although the acting was excellent i spent the whole movie waiting for the nasty boy who caused so much grief to so many of the characters get his final nemesis and instead everyone else suffered except him and he gets the job of the husband whose wifes death he causes by running away from his friends wins the girl he gave an overdose to and tried to rape even his friend gives money to his father but the butterfly effect completely fails to return to its cause  this is a very dark film as each character that gets affected suffers never ending depression none of the normal avenues for relief seem to be effective and the only thing the authorities seem to do is give out quantities of stress pills  if this is normal behaviour in finland now im never going to go back just in case i am affected by such an amoral butterfly and end up as destroyed as the characters in this film were,negative,0
this is one of the best episodes from the entire xfiles series creepy beyond words the tension and suspense in this episode is very well executed in its entire 45 minutes it managed to be almost as scary as an entire movie this episode joins the ranks of best episodes with such greats as home humbug bad blood and milagro for being the best in their respective season  mulder and scullys growing relationship is put to the test in this episode can they really trust each other this episode also contains a tiny scene that will leave romantic viewers smiling  mulder bring your mittens,positive,1

this gets a two because i liked it as a kid but it became so redundant that i just started to hate it i cant give this a descriptive review because it would be restating one thing after the other i probably wouldnt say anything that everyone else didnt say already  the only other thing about this show is that its pretty nasty with the kid with the boil to that twisted babysitter to the stupidity that runs around and about in it i have a cousin that loves this show and hes the strangest and dumbest person i have met this show should be pulled from the air its always the same thing over and over they need to put better shows on nick im getting really really tired of stuff like this,negative,0
i really enjoyed watching this movie only a few parts were slow but it was only setting the mood and building up to the action i thought this movie was very educational it taught me more about my croatian heritage i also learned more about louise arbour and i can say she has a very great influence on me time magazine named louise arbour one of the worlds 100 most influential people in april of 2004 i recommend this movie to people that like historical movies obviously this movie was very dramatic but still told the truth of events in the former yugoslavia louise arbour is a brave hero and im glad they made a movie honouring her if you see the movie i hope youll like it,positive,1

if you like me is going to see this in a film history class or something like that at your school try to convince your teacher to see something else believe me anything is better than this movie it is slow paced confusing boring poorly constructed gory gringy do i need to go on its message is good but i have seen them been handled better in several other films the acting isnt even any good this movie is just even more awkward as it start off as being funny not intensional thoughbecause of its surreal story than at the end just becomes uncomfortable to watch  i honestly feel like 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life has been robbed why would anyone want to watch a girls describe a threesome for 10 minutes than watch them drive through a traffic jam for 20 minutes listen to a hippie who can make sheep appear witness a sort of rape than see the female lead role eat her husband  honestly this movie deserves nothing but a 110 and if your not happy with my previewseriously im an open minded guy and i like movies that protest through symbolism but this movie was just awful make any excuse you can to avoid this film,negative,0
oh dear lord how on earth was any part of this film ever approved by anyone it reeks of cheese from start to finish but its not even good cheese its the scummiest moldiest most tasteless cheese there is and i cannot believe there is anyone out there who actually truly enjoyed it yes if you saw it with a load of drunkstoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen i watched it with an upforafewlaughs guy having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the films expected crapness we got the crapness plenty of it but not the chuckles it doesnt even qualify as a sobaditsgood movie its just plain bad very very bad heres why look away if youre spoilerphobic the movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death ok i was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was but i think i grasped the this guy is a bit of a badass who you dont want to mess with message behind the ingenious scene oh and a guy witnesses it so we already have our ultraevil bad guy and wussy but cute apparently good guy cue hero big sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish ie hero is immune to bullets everyone else falls over rather clumsily cue first plot hole how the bloody hell did sammy know where this guy was or that hed watched the murder perhaps this and the answers to all my plothole related questions was explained in the 2 minutes before i got into the cinema but i doubt it in fact im going to stop poking holes in the plot right here lest i turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese which we all know is good cheese so the plot a very generous word to use good guy must get to la evil guy would rather he didnt hero sam stands between the two cue scenery for the next vomitinducing hour  the passenger plane as i said no more poking at plot holes ill just leave it there passenger plane next the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie and what makes it everything it is  snakes yay oh pause first we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have hot horny couple see if you can guess how they die deadbeforeanysnakesevenappear british guy those pesky brits eh cute kids and jo brand for all you americans thats an english comic famous for her size and unattractiveness now that weve met the cast lets watch all of them die except of course the cute kids dont expect anything original its just snake bites on various and everincreasingly hilarious really not parts of the body use your imagination since the filmmakers obviously didnt use theirs  so thats most of the film wrapped up so now for the best bit the ending as expected everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face yep icecool sammy included but wait were not all off the plane yet the last guy to get off is good guy but just as he does he gets bitten by a you guessed it snake of all things clearly this one had been hiding in mr jacksons hair the whole time since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier despite the 200ft constrictor the one that ate that pesky british bugger being unable to so sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop at this point i prayed that the movie was about to make a muchneeded uturn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort but no in a kind of icing on the cake way but with stale cheese remember it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest how anyone can think that an audience 10 years ago let alone in 2006 would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me but it did well in summing up the film  actually were not quite done yet after everyone has sucked face uncle sam with leading actress good guy with tiffany token black guy with token white girl and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia its time for good guy and hero to get it onin bali nope it wasnt at all exciting the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll yes the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times thats it this is the first time ive ever posted a movie review but i felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography if you like planes snakes samuel ljackson air hostesses bad guys surfing dogs in bags or english people then please please dont see this movie it will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that youll never want to come into contact with any of them ever again go see united 93 instead that was good,negative,0
full disclosure im a cynic i like my endings sad and my hankies dry i didnt cry when bambis mother was shot will smiths new film happiness looks like a desperate plea for an oscar basically i was born without an artistic soul   so why on earth did i like 10 items or less maybe it was the double espresso i downed before the show or more likely maybe it was that even the most hardboiled of movie fans could use an occasional shot of sweetness   and sweet it is from the moment him meets scarlet an event far from a nora ephron meet cute the view is taken on an intimate journey with two strangers learning to care about where their lives are headed aided beautifully by phedon papamichaels cinema verity style camera work  the main argument about the film is that its too far fetched is the film far fetched i dont know you tell me ive yet to meet adrian brody at the market however not for lack of trying do i enjoy considering the adventures that might occur should this momentous event take place darn straight i do   thats where most reviews of 10 items or less fall short   they fail to take into account that even we cynics have fantasies and heck sometimes its worth the price of admission to vicariously live them 82 minutes at a time,positive,1

three young movie theater employees are given the task of reopening a long closed oldtime theater at which many years before a shocking series of grisly murders took place it seems many more murders have occurred since then but all of this remains unknown to these three young upstart employees hoping to finally make it big on their own as they approach the grand reopening night things keep getting stranger and more unsettling with items suddenly starting to move around by themselves without any seen aid and a terrifying old man seemingly haunting the premises  oh this is truly horrible in fact if it wasnt for mary woronovs secretary character being such a fiercely independent outspoken empowered young woman who steals practically every scene in which she appears and the incredibly hot chick who played the unbelievably sleazy yet totally sexy selina this would be a total loss the only other good thing i have to say about this film is some of the movie theater murders are done in truly inventive albeit not overly gory a preference for me but not necessarily for others fashion the rest just wallows in constant sleaze so extreme the rare few may actually find humor in it and runs through the predictable slasher kills annoying characters off one after the other routine,negative,0
this movie is crappy beyond any limits its incredible  a very bad ripoff from jaws and other better shark movies a really bad one  everything is really pathetic the story is purest crap actors are bad effects very cheap no creativity whatsoever it looks like some really debilitated children took jaws script and arranged it randomly then its parents took their 8 mm camera and shot the movie with their neighbors the music is really inappropriate just some elevator music bland and overly optimistic when nothing happens then slightly less optimistic when shark is around or when children gets depressed again listens to very loud elevator music carlo maria the author should be so ashamed he should ask for his name to be erased from the titles the movie acts as perfect demonstration how crappy music will destroy any scene which is supposed to be thrilling there is one major difference to jaws though in the beginning of jaws there are comments about stupid people who try to kill shark with dynamite well there is an attempt to kill a shark with dynamite when this does not work guys take an big load of dynamite and spent like 14 of movie by placing explosives in some sunken ship this is really original way to catch the fish i have to admit they use so much dynamite like they would try to kill a battleship i would guess bismarck class of battleship or to dig another panama channel this is just incredible im glad they did not try to use napalmflamethrower or tactical nuclear strike to eliminate this bad bad approximately 2 m shark well there is mystic disappearing native indian who looks like german pensioner too in this mess this is not a movie this is a warning example how bad the movies may be as a warning it is useful but the public should be protected from this crap most of italian movies is bad but this this is really exceptional in the worst sense of the word,negative,0

this post may contain spoilers   although it was 5 years after the series ended and wb was currently working on justice league this animated movie is a welcome addition to the video library why well if mask of the phantasm compliments the first 70 episodes of batman the animated series and subzero compliments the 15 episodes of the adventures of batman and robin then mystery of the batwoman compliments the final 24 episodes of the gotham knights version of batman kevin conroy once again delivers a voice over performance that is nothing short of excellence and perfection i admit i was a bit leery when i heard about batwoman and all i could think about were the old 50s comics of batman but i was blown away by the batwoman character her look her costume which i assumed inspired bruce wayne to create the costume on batman beyondand the fact that this movie keeps you guessing who batwoman is all the way through if you want to know who batwoman is then buy or rent the dvd barbara gordon makes a cameo appearance and i think the writers were trying to hint that bruce and barbara had something going on between them like they did in batman beyond tim drake appears as robin but his role is a small one and sadly there is no sign of or mention of dick grayson alias nightwing which leads me to believe he has established himself in bludhaven his city in the comics  of the three suspects for batwoman my favorite is kathy duquesne who looks an awful lot like halle berry kelly ripa did a great job as one of the other suspects when it comes to the villains im glad the penguin was one of them but i did not like the fact that they replaced paul williams with david ogden stiers pengy just didnt sound right same thing goes for robin the new guy did okay but just as i was starting to get used to matt valencia they replaced him its interesting to note that kevin michael richardson who voices carlton duquesne is now the voice of the joker in the batman series and we finally see what rupert thorne looks like revamped since he didnt show up in the gotham knights episodes the late john vernon will be missed although i enjoyed henry silva as the voice of bane if he had to be replaced they got the right man in the form of hector elizondo i only wish they could have used two face riddler or the scary new version of the scarecrow  the musical score and especially the soft sounding intro were superb i wish that was on a soundtrack and i especially enjoyed the beautiful and talented cherie in the iceberg lounge along with her song betcha neva while some feel that this movie is weaker than the mask of the phantasm and subzero i find it just as strong and enjoyable as the rest plus like i said earlier its a full length movie based off the gotham knights version of batman which i think gives a good balance i would at least recommend renting this dvd first before buying it for those who might be leery of this movie but personally its well worth the purchase i give mystery of the batwoman a 9,positive,1
ive only seen about a half dozen films starring lino ventura but this one seems very much like the others he plays a laconic criminalone who is short on words and subdued yet occasionally explosive given his quiet persona in such films as army of shadows and second breath ive noticed that his minimalist style of acting is extremely effective in other words because he is so quiet and mannered when he does bad things you tend to notice and like these other films he also has a very strong though twisted moral code  abel davos ventura and his partner lilane are both living in italy and are career criminals both grew up in france and eventually had to flea due to their criminal activities now in italy as the film begins they continue to live the life of thugs and the heat is on to catch them oddly instead of running to yet a third country they decide to go back to franceeven though davos has been tried and convicted in absentiaand if hes caught it could mean a life in prison or the death penalty much of the first third of the film concerns their covert return  unfortunately for davos the return doesnt go perfectly and now it seems as if every cop in france is looking for him additionally the reaction of his old compatriots in crime is not at all what hed expect in fact their tepid response to his return ends up unleashing a series of terrible events towards the end of the film  along the way davos meets and is taken in my a stranger eric stark jeanpaul belmondo despite davos seemingly having no friends stark and his lady friend try their best to make his return successful what throws another monkey wrench into this though is davos two very young sonswhat is davos to do with themkeep them with him in his hiding place   overall this is a very good crime filmsort of like french film noir unlike american noir the many french versions i have seen have a more realistic as well as bleak outlook to them fatalism reigns supreme thats for sure the acting is firstrate especially from ventura and belmondo the direction very sure and the writing very nice though i am sure many wont like the ending it just seems to be tacked onlike an afterthought i understood why they did it this way but can also see how it might leave many unsatisfied as for me it did leave me a tad flat otherwise an exceptional film,positive,1
  robot jox is a great little film ok some of the sets are bad and the acting is not that great but the special effects are very good for a film of this size and age you have to remember that this film is over 10 years old now and was made very cheaply in the 1st place so you cant moan to much about the bad parts so just sit back and watch a cool film with great big robots in it,positive,1
this film was just brilliantcastinglocation scenerystorydirectioneveryones really suited the part they playedand you could just imagine being thererobert redfords is an amazing actor and now the same being directornormans father came from the same scottish island as myselfso i loved the fact there was a real connection with this filmthe witty remarks throughout the film were greatit was just brilliantso much that i bought the film as soon as it was released for retail and would recommend it to everyone to watchand the flyfishing was amazingreally cried at the end it was so sadand you know what they say if you cry at a film it must have been goodand this definitely was also congratulations to the two little boys that played the parts of norman and paul they were just brilliantchildren are often left out of the praising list i think because the stars that play them all grown up are such a big profile for the whole filmbut these children are amazing and should be praised for what they have done dont you think the whole story was so lovely because it was true and was someones life after all that was shared with us all,positive,1
this is one of the most spiritual movies i have ever seen i headed up with about 150 people to st george and we saw this movie in the visiting center of the st george temple not one person had dry eyes in the audience also there were some non religious and antimormon people in the audience who felt the spirit of the movie and were touched by the captivating music and reenactment of the story of the pioneers and the hardships they faced because of their beliefs  i recommend this movie for anyone who wishes to understand more about joseph and the hardships that the pioneers went through after all it is apart of american history,positive,1
the duo of abbott and costello lives on in this version of a storytime classic in jack and the beanstalk theres everything to see music magic and comedy rolled into one costello play plays jack after he listens to the story being told by a young boy one time we know jack was a poor boy who sells his cow dolly for 5 magic beans well he plants those 5 beans and they were indeed magic he climbs to the sky sees a big castle there and he would sing a song unknown he would encounter the giantbuddy baer not only him he would dance with the woman who was also a giant she would clobber jack with her elbows during the dance that was funny you got the playing harp who knows how to put the giant as ease the goose who lays golden eggs and my favorite the way jack gets rid of the giant he gets the ax and started chopping down on the beanstalk another funny is where the ax got stuck during the chop and the final celebration happens when the people dance around the imprint where the giant fell a lot of fun and fun for the whole family as well very recommended 5 stars,positive,1
ben stryker an exgreen beret stops off at a little town called agua dolee to visit an old friend tick rand soon after riding into town on his suzuki and settling in a motorcycle gang known as the savages whos led by tyrant pigiron invade and finally take over the place stryker doesnt want to get involved but that changes when he friends become the actual targets  is there anything good to say about this scuzzy item tough call as the only fundamental reason to watch this lowbudget car wreck is for the tremendous bcast the crew managed to get hold off for this project while i dont think its a complete botch job its not terribly good either now what a cast lance henriksen being the main character he strangely doesnt have top billing but the final one karen black george kennedy richard lynch bill forsythe mickey jones and leo gordon now what went wrong with this scummy lowbudget bungle the shallowness of the material is too onedimensional that it heavily borrows ideas from better movies namely mad max and comes up with a complete mess of ideas that just dont gel and could have been better thought out the clichés that are used can be manipulated into a good viewing despite being predictable but savage dawn seems to let it skimpily rush all by without letting the viewer soak it all up the cast are mostly wasted in nothing roles a bleachedblonde henriksen is capably solid and even with his commending presence that provides an enigmatic glow to his character he doesnt get up to hell of a lot and sometimes goes missing in action too much sideline action but when he did kick some bikers ass the good times flowed karen blacks hissing performance is a very odd one and is all about the screaming and cursing although she does get into one memorable catfight with claudia udys flirtatious vixen character katie a wheelchair bound george kennedy roams around aimlessly until the final assault and richard lynch looks embarrassed as a wayward priest  town mayor in a very redundant role an on edge bill forsythe simply chews it up as the head honcho of the notorious biker pack  the junky story written by william milling and max bloom has that cheesy comic book getup and very much is influenced by the western genre just look at the villains for that how they came up with their names is mystery maybe they drew them out of a hat its pretty second rate material that more often moves onto one lacklustre scene after another unfunny comical elements are chucked in and as well a bit of sleaze tacky exploitation that doesnt get gritty enough and the deaths are quite laughable a clumsy script is filled convoluted details and unbearable trite simon nuchterns spotty direction was by the numbers and tepidly laid out one or two intense scenes cant makeup for its tortoiselike pacing and many cackhanded stunts the cardboard sets had down n dirty look but lack that organic sense the gravellike cinematography by gerald feil was better handled when the main focus wasnt on the town but on the desolate backdrop like the beginning and ending climax of the film with some neat camera touches pino donaggios clunky music choices are drowned out by its own incompetence  savage dawn is a forgettable quickie midnight movie thats a definite misfire for most part there are better and more convincing exercises of the same ilk out there,negative,0
although i have to admit i laughed more watching this movie than the last few comedies i saw  the budget must have consisted of pocket change from the actors the production values are so low that they actual made it kind of fun to watch reminds me of the robot monster made up of a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet on  in one scene a hapless victim gets their arm and leg cut off geez hard to believe but the black knight scene from holy grail was more realistic i kept wondering why the victim didnt start shouting  none shall pass and  its only a flesh wound ive had worse it was one of the funniest scenes ive seen in the past year  the gladiatordemon was a stitch too between the horribly cheap costume and the geeky look of the guy in it the end result was hysterical  truly a movie that is bad enough to be watchable kind of like seeing a slow motion auto accident on film  ,negative,0
having seen carlo lizzanis documentary on luchino visconti i was bound to higher expectations before watching this film made three years later by adam low but the viewer like me did get dissatisfied i faced a need for critical opinion which i generally dont like giving due to the fact there are no documentaries that will satisfy every viewer there are also no documentaries that will examine a theme totally but when i read the reviews already written on this title i also felt a bit confused people sometimes dont know what to criticize therefore to be clear ill divide this film into two major parts that differ considerably the former one about visconti before his directors career and latter one about visconti the director   the aristocratic background all the hobbies the wealth that young luchino experienced and enjoyed are clearly presented his effort in horse racing is mentioned as well as his relation with his mother so much disturbed after his parents divorce we also get a very accurate idea of where luchino was brought up as a real count of milano in riches galore with nannies cooks with access to everything in true aristocracy for instance his fathers splendid villa at grazzano and other marvelous villas prove that there is also an emphasis on viscontis crucial visit in paris in the 1930s where he met eminent people left wingers who later had impact on his style and message in art that clearly explains the idea of a communist with the aristocratic upbringing a contrast at first sight   however the part about his directors career which started with ossessione during wwii and ended with innocente just before the directors death in 1976 is poorly executed his movies are not discussed well why because there are very few people who really have something to say franco zeffirelli the director remembers the works on la terra trema and that is all right there are also some interviews with franco rosi but later such movies like il gattopardo la caduta dei rei la morte a venezia or ludwig are mostly discussed by helmut berger although i liked the actor in the role of ludwig i did not like the interviews of his moreover some thoughts he reveals are not accurate to entail in such a documentary there is no mention of significant works of visconti like conversation piece there are no interviews with eminent cast burt lancaster a mention about silvana mangano and romy schneider should also be made there is one footage interview with maria callas that appears to be interesting but that is only a short bit franco zeffirelli though i appreciate him as a director makes fun of it all rather than says something really precious for instance he mentions the event how visconti separated from him after years of service therefore i say simplified and unsatisfactory   what i find a strong point here are footage interviews with visconti himself as a result we may get his own opinion about his works for instance i very much appreciate the words he says about death regarding it as a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself he also discusses his health problems after the stroke while filming ludwig  i believe it is better to see luchino visconti 1999 by carlo lizzani than this doc although it is shorter and condensed as a whole you will get a better idea of the director visconti would be furious about that and the fury of his usually turned peoples emotions and viewpoints into stone 410,negative,0
i saw this movie when i was much younger and i thought it was funny i saw it again last week and you can guess the result some funny parts in it very few and too long the beginning is the only thing that is funny if you ask me  if you want a total bmovie this is a good pick but dont expect too much from aliens dwarf size,negative,0
the big problem is where to begin as this movie needs your attention the forthcoming two hours and you better not miss some minutes for getting a coke as there is a danger you cant follow but good there is also a pausebutton bruce willis must travel into a timemachine to find out some antivirus for a virus that made animals rule over the world in 1996 thanks to some mistakes he first ends up in 1990 then in the first world war and how messed up it all might look like terry gilliam comes up with what must be one of the most intelligent scripts ever this exmonty phyton man knows exactly how genius sfstories has to be told like and his choice of cast couldnt have been any better there is the lunatic brad pitt his performance in the asylum is memorable and a superb bruce willis who proves he is more than some schwarzeneggerwanna be its a movie you can watch over and over again as the script is so weird and complicated and yet you can follow that every view gives you other surprises one of my big favourites,positive,1
this movie is horrendous decent fight scenes or not the acting is really bad like you can tell theyre reading their lines from a card with painful line delivery by everyone in the cast think watching a high school play and cringing at the obvious lack of smoothness in the actors interactions weird pauses between different characters lines combined with hurried line delivery by others if the movie were all action this might be forgivable but a lot of the movie includes plot setup and family guy style irreverent cut aways oh wow are they badly done im assuming they were attempting to be funny with these but it again came off as a bunch of highschoolers college entry students goofing off for the afternoon trying to set up a funny youtube clip   now to the fight scenes theyre not too bad considering the level of quality seen everywhere else in the film nothing great either certainly not anywhere near the same level as other posters have stated nothing like drunken master the fights have an overly staged feel with lots of cuts to different angles with blatantly different positions by those involved   in sum the only reason to watch this movie is if you were one of the guys friends involved with this very very cheap production which guy you may ask oh the same guy who wrote directed produced and stared in this middle school masterpiece,negative,0
the premise of bottom crossed with fawlty towers sounds great however ade edmonson  rik mayall have managed to create a film that raises barely a titter ten years ago rik mayalls mad stare and ades idiocy were funny now they are just annoying  the film had promise  though the most horrendous hotel in britain is not a new idea  but failed to deliver the saving graces were competent performances from simon spaced big train pegg and helene mathieu and the film is only 90 minutes long sorry guys but you really have hit the bottom,negative,0
this is not direct cinéma as a matter of fact it is its opposite second installment of filmmaker gatlifs gypsy trilogy this french work produced by michèle raygavras is a film masterpiece not pure documentary no fiction by any means instead gatlif has chosen different locations of the route from india to spain wherever the rom people have a strong presence and with the help of art directors he has staged several musical numbers that tell us how the gypsies live sing dance struggle and have survived the movie may have strong opposition from those who question the hypothesis that the rom tribe is of indian origin mostly challenged by those who see a direct link with the hebrews so in a way it comes as no surprise that they were also persecuted by the nazis but above any anthropological argument this is a work of great beauty strong colors and wonderful singing and dancing,positive,1
if you read errol flynns autobiography my wicked wicked ways you will see that this film is full of poetic licence not that that makes much of a difference because errol flynn was pretty generous with poetic licence in the autobiography anyway no need to worry about spoilers since there is nothing there to spoil  to me it would seem more sensible to use the story about a fictitious hollywood actor then you could go out and find a better actor than duncan regehr to play him and you wouldnt have to worry about the audience saying things like but he didnt have a moustaches in captain blood another failing of this film is that it shows flynn as a twodimensional character flynn was an intelligent man well educated well read this film only concentrates on his funster image  regehr is a disaster the rest of the cast struggle with their scripts hal linden is ok as warner and barbara hershey makes a believable damita although lili damita herself did not think so  the best thing to do with this film is to forget about it and let it gently slip away to oblivion so what i am writing this for i cant imagine,negative,0
i completely forgot that id seen this within a couple of days which is pretty revealing in itself the umpteenth version of gaston phantom of the opera lerouxs lockeddoor countryhouse mystery i had heard that it was an engaging and witty update so it appeared from the likable title sequence and a few neat touches in the opening scene but the film very quickly ground to a halt and became vaguely tedious and wholly unsatisfying  as a mystery the major problem is that it is fundamentally unsolvable by the audience like the worst agatha christies it depends on a character appearing in the final act with a wealth of background information that we have not been privy to as a film be it comedy or thriller the crucial problem is that characterisation is almost nonexistent with the exception of the killer everyone is a facevalue version of the typical suspects in the typical countryhouse murder story  reporter endangered heiress suspicious fiancé scatterbrained scientist father a surprisingly poor michel lonsdale etc theres no depth and little of interest and the frequently overripe or misjudged performances dont help you frankly dont care about anyone in it so theres no jeopardy or suspense only claude rich and in the last reel pierre arditi get anything to work with and only in the last reel does the film get close to a sense of resonance that is too fleeting to be really effective  for the rest we get endless exposition and a couple of ineffective wouldbe comic set pieces a promising one with a photographer trapped inside a grandfather clock is just too poorly thought through to pay off with dennis podalydes reduced to irving the explainer for the last third of the picture im not fond of countryhouse movies or agatha christie style whodunits so those who are might cit it a lot more slack but i found it a poor show as rich says when the mystery is revealed its all rather something of a disappointment,negative,0
ok i for one thought the trailer was quite good so was hopeful for this film plus with the cast line up i was sure it couldnt get less than a 6 in my books however i got annoyed half hour into the story just where normal films get good this film hit rock bottom   spoiler  the guy who everyone is trying to help is so caring of other people getting hurt in the middle of the hustle that he turns on his colleagues to save a tramp and then locks himself inside one of the armoured trucks not only that he constantly tries to get other peoples attention by which he ends up endangering more people and long story short the outcome is that he is responsible for not just the tramps death but also a police officer getting shot and the kidnapping of his younger brother oh and all 5 of his colleagues dying disgraced deaths   but in the end he is happy because he came to his senses halfway through the endeavour so what if all his colleagues are now dead rather than sticking to the plan and being a millionaire this film tried to be so politically correct it makes me sick ruined a good story shame really,negative,0
there are many police dramas doing the rounds i am not sure why its probably to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil  this film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of anne a raw recruit into a police squad stationed in the baltic area no attempt is made to glamorise the police they are truly down to earth harsh at times and unforgiving anne on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition against all rules she sometimes holds back incriminating information found on her strip searches and other investigations  this is not a pleasant film not one to relax you there is not much feeling of optimism in it the police seem to be involved in a losing battle tomorrow there will be more bashings more murders more family breakups and more distressed children lets face it this is the world we live in  as days go by anne becomes more intimately involved with the police and with the families they are investigating the only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character benny a 12 year old from a broken family anne has her own way of patching things up she turns a blind eye to bennys shoplifting and tries to help him as best she can i was surprised though that she went so far as to seduce bennys father it set me wondering if it was in consideration of the father or her own needs after all the film makes it clear that she was desperately in need of a partner and loving children  well cast but not my idea of an evenings entertainment,positive,1
warning spoilers galore  tim burton remaking this sui generis movie is about as sensible as remaking psycho  oh thats right some idiot already did that  i rest my case  movie opens with chimpnaut blundering a simulation proving hes not that smart from the outset marky mark appears in shot without his characteristic underpants showing then is turned down by a plain woman who prefers the touch of chimpanzees  the perfunctory establishing shot of the space station orbiting saturn for no apparent reason interior of ship abustle with genetic experiments on apes must we travel 1300 million kilometers to saturn to conduct these experiments the special effects team decrees it  markys chimp gets lost in that staple of 60s scifi cinema  the time warp marky then demonstrates the space stations mindboggling security ineptness by stealing a pod without anyone noticing while simultaneously demonstrating his abject stupidity in mounting a deepspace rescue mission into a wormhole for an expendable test chimp with a million dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen supplies  before anyone can say pointless remake marky has surfed the wormhole crashed on an alien planet removed his helmet without any thought to the lethality of the atmosphere and is being chased through a sound stage that almost resembles a lush rainforest if it werent for the kliegs backlighting the plastic trees  surprise its apes doing the chasing  or at least it would have been a surprise if no one saw planet of the apes thirtythree years ago  since marky mark did not get to show his pecs take down his pants or bust his lame whiteboy rap he was characterless michael clarke duncans gorilla teeth being inserted crookedly helped immensely in establishing his lack of character helena bonhamcarter aka irritating chimp activist at a loss without a shakespearean script did a fine job of outdoing both marky and clarke as most cardboard cutout paul giamatti the orangutan slave trader secured the role of token comic relief and interspecies klutz though i have grown bilious in hearing puns relating to this movie one review headline captured the essence of this planet of the apes reimagining the apes of roth while everyone else minced about looking like extras from one million years bc or greystoke tim roth as chimpanzee thade chews massive amounts of scenery and hurls kaka splendiferously as entertaining as his portrayal of the psychotic thade was his character lacked a behavioral arc thade is mad when we first meet him and hes pretty much at the same level of mad at films end nice twist  the original pota 1968 featured a leading character charlton hestons taylor who was so disenchanted with mankind that he left earth for space with no regrets  yet as that film progressed taylor unwittingly found himself locked in a battle to prove mankinds worth  as their sole champion the original film was ultimately a tale of humiliation not salvation when taylor discovers the statue of liberty he is forced to realize that his species had not prevailed is there anything that cerebral or ironic to marky marks leo or roths thade no but theres lots of running  the slogans cry take back the planet but its the apes planet in this movie humans and apes crashlanded here together the humans having degenerated to cavepeople allowing the apes to acquire speech and sensual body armor the apes deserved to inherit the planet along comes marky mark in true anthropocentric arrogance taking it for granted that humans have to be the apex predators simply because theyre there taking it back is as ludicrous as apes landing here in 2001 complaining a planet where men evolved from apes and then causing trouble with their overacting and hairy anuses  heston was cast in the 1968 pota because he had established his reputation as a maverick he was benhur michelangelo moses to cast him as the mute dogged animal in an alien society was to stupefy an audiences expectations how crazed must a world be where our man charlton cannot command respect marky mark has currently only established that he has tight underpants  though heston was denigrated constantly by the ape council he dominated the screen with his charisma and stupendous overacting when marky mark tries to instill fervor in the mongoloid humans its like that unpopular guy in school suddenly being made classroom monitor who tells you to stop drawing penises on the blackboard and you throw a shoe at him burton tries to elevate marky to humanitys icon but he comes off as a chittering deviant in the original film the apes deem taylor a deviant yet he was to audience and apes alike an icon of humanity that irony again  it was apt that a man who elevated scenechewing to an acting technique  heston  should play the father of this films primo scenechewer thaddeus roth as roths apedad charlton utters his own immortal lines turned against the humans this time damn them damn them all to hell  the movie gets dumb and dumber towards the end while thaddeus is giving marky an assbeating lesson a pod descends from on high with markys chimpnaut in it apes demonstrate their hebetude by bowing in obeisance to this incognizant creature while marky proves his own hebetude by muttering lets teach these monkeys about evolution firstly theyre not monkeys you ape secondly it was genetic tampering and imbecilic plot fabrications which brought the apes to this point not evolution and what you intend to teach them by blowing them away with the concealed lasergun is called misanthropy not evolution  giving away the twist ending would only confuse viewers into believing that estella warrens halfnekkid role was actually integral to the plot be still my pants  no matter that he was humankinds last underpanted hope in the end cop apes take marky away to plot point prison where he was last heard ululating its a madhouse a madhouse,negative,0
first off im not here to dog this movie i find it totally enjoyable in spite of the poor production quality the acting herein is about as abominable as the monster stalking them although the monster itself is quite well doneimpressively well done at that he actually looks kind of otherworldly like an alien family on vacation landed in the himalayas and while dad was out taking a  attending to natures call spot got loose and they just didnt have time to hunt him down that or hes the caucasian brother of the wishmaster i havent decided which  actually this seems to have been filmed somewhere in snow country yes but more likely canada somewhere than china anywhere the trees and vistas say canada to me and its okay that the set area never takes on the look or feel of ubercoldness one might expect to find in the himalayas of china its a scifi channel movie so we can forgive the lack of location  further apparently as we have just established scifi directors do not travel often as they are not aware that commercial planes fly above weather like what is featured herein and the subsequent crash actually would not have happened but as i said its a scifi channel movie so we must forgive a few things  the movie is pretty graphic at times and rotates between alive about the donner party predator about the alien in the woods and any bad wushu movie where they fly about on wires the yeti apparently can leap about like spidermanor super marioremember run faster jump higher live longer   also the yeti has missed his teddy bear hes searched high and low for it but cannot seem to make a cadaver work poor yeti you cant help but feel sorry for it it has survived and evolved thousands of years only to succumb to severe teddy bear loss hes missed his bear or maybe it wants to mate but that thought is banished do ya hear me well it does seem to be an unmated male rebanished   and its superhuman well its not humanits superyeti but then again whats normalyeti i dont know but he has a definite michael meyers quality that is completely unsettling and hes got this fabulous way of cleaning his fur fabulous dahlink its spotlessly white at times when it so shouldnt be hes fastidiously superhusuperyeti  all in all this was a lot of fun to watch has some great kills and a few honest plot elements in spite of the horribly gravellike production style this is actually quite entertaining i cant help wondering if theyre planning on another one   it rates a 6010 on the m4tv scale  it rates a 4410 on the movie scale from  the fiend ,negative,0
this is not a bad movie it follows the new conventions of modern horror that is the movie within a movie the well known actress running for her life in the first scene this movie takes the old convention of a psycho killer on he loose and manage to do something new and interesting with it it is also always nice to see molly ringwald back for the attack  so this might be an example of what the genre has become cut hits all the marks and is actually scary in some parts i liked it i gave it an eight,positive,1
being a fan of time travel stories i was surprised that there was no device that sent russell johnsons character through time he just appeared in 1865 it was a disappointing part of the episode i enjoyed the premise of the dangers of altering the future by changing the past other twilight zone episodes about time travel such as no time like the past once upon a time etc were more to my liking because of the uses of time travel devices perhaps if russell johnsons character had been the same character he played in execution it would have been more acceptable to fans like myself as scifi fans know no characters really ever have to die in time travel episodes all sorts of plot twists can be applied in these types of stories that was the only flaw i could comment on for this episode,positive,1
this is about as stupid as it gets  a classic case of twodimensional characters who always act exactly contrary as to what a sane person would do in the same situation it reminds me of a scene in scary movie where carmen electra flees from the killer there are two signs one marked to safety the other one to sure death i am reciting from memory  and just like in scary movie the characters always run into the direction marked sure death   why oh why did the girl start the fire in the teller booth and hold the door shut  did she prefer to die in the fire instead being killed by the guy why oh why after cutting and overpowering the driver did they sit him in the seat and have him being watched by the wounded guy instead of plain shooting him or at the very least knocking him out he was running over their friend and killing him a minute before yet they have scruples  why oh why a hundred things more    if this movie were a road you could not drive a single yard because of the holes everything is so farfetched its starting to physically hurt at times  add mercilessly overplaying actors and a small budget to that and heres what you get looking at the rating and the comments i get the feeling those people have been watching an entirely different movie  the one thing missing really is the infamous red toolbox from while she was out  a movie that is about similar in unrealistic plot and stupid behavior of the characters,negative,0
some people might consider this movie a piece of artwork  to be able to express your imagination on film in order to create a movie filled with antagonizing pain and death i personally think that this movie is a disgust which should have never been released this movie is repulsive illogical and meaningless not only is it a complete waste of time but it makes you sick for days to come the appalling images shown in the film not only make you grasp for air but they set in your mind and it takes days to forget them such a shame that people waste their imagination on such inhumane suffering kill bill would be another example but at least kill bill has its purpose meaning climax and resolution,negative,0

this is one of the worst movies ever made trite predictable flat  the only thing that rated one point was there was a few nice scenes highlighting barcelona i imagine they would use films like this in guantanamo or some other hidden ciansa prison to torture suspects  often bad movies have some redeeming features this has nothing if i was in it or worked on it i would change my name truly a turd hard to write more than this but i feel the worlds film watchers needed a heads up on this on the other hand it will make a great gift for people you cant stand  you could send it to politicians you dislike in laws exwives teachers you hated former employees dick cheney w and a host of others,negative,0
this is the prime example of low budget winning over what would be a good story line lets bring back samaire armstrong having seen her work on the oc i know she can do better then find a better script and budget  the special effects were so bad and mostly badly computer generated that it almost lost me with the first time the wolf was seen onscreen and samaire armstrongs alertchanging into a werewolf was done by reducing her at first to a bad gcif figure before she even begins to changefinal fantasys humans as well as pixars made these laughable think of the figure as a nude barbie doll  the story of was interesting though the idea of bloodline in werewolves is nothing new as it also got into the balance between evil maybe not so evil and the possible end of humankind should the two lines mate the subplot of a book of werewolf linage which effected some of the other characters in a spelllike manner for a while was effective but could have been expanded more in explaining what had happened in the past   bring in a better script and direction and id come back again,negative,0
i remember flipping through channels on hbo and saw this this my friends is one of the worst tv movies ive ever seen there is no excitement in this film  the story starts out with drew summerscandice cameron bure driving to a small town while in a trance she stays with a couple who coincidentally had a daughter named laura fairgate who looked exactly like her and is played by the same actress even the townsfolk agree that they looked alike thing is laura was killed over a year ago her boyfriend went missing around the same time she was murdered making it look like he had killed her  while settling in this town for a while drew starts to have visions and nightmares these visions and nightmares might prove that the boyfriend of laura isnt the killer after all throughout the film you find out that ray ordwell srdenis arndt is the one that raped her frequently over a period of time and killed her  the movie is too long and very boring the film just drags on and on and on and on amazingly i saw another tv movie after this called cloned 1997 which was good but ill review that one later  i give this movie 1 star out of 10 avoid this tv movie it is not worth your time this is the worst tv movie of 1997,negative,0
charles chaplins shoulder arms of 1918 was his longest film to date though at just over 45 minutes in length it was not quite a feature film with world war one just drawing to a close many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops and chaplin was no exception and so the lovable tramp went to war the film begins with the tramp in training and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills including marching and gunslinging much to the disgust of his drill sergeant the tramp then finds himself in the trenches faced with a more formidable foe though the germans eventually turn out of be infinitely more incompetent than even he the uproarious moment when the tramp declares that he singlehandedly captured thirteen german soldiers by surrounding them had me in stitches  there are plenty of other great moments in this film chaplin awaking to find his sleeping barracks underwater and being unable to literally find his own feet is hilarious as is his ingenious use of a tube from a record player to sleep beneath the surface  however the most memorable scenes in the film undoubtedly involve chaplin skulking behind enemy lines disguised as a tree the reactions of the bumbling german soldiers unknowingly just metres from a sworn enemy as they are singlehandedly disabled onebyone are highly amusing especially when one soldier grapples an axe with the intention of cutting down a tree for firewood  this is a very enjoyable film and one of the best of chaplins pre1920 efforts highly recommended,positive,1
back in 1994 the power rangers had become a huge franchise and tv executives at the usa network were hoping to get in on the action and came up with the tattooed teenage alien fighters from beverly hills in which the evil emporer gorganus who looks like hes wearing a home made darth vader costume and his talking bird that looks like a rubber dog chew toy come to earth to invade it using giant monsters that look like rejects from a 1970s godzilla film fortunately nimbar an alien that looks like a giant piece of clear jello recruits four teenagers to defend the earth nimbar gives them each a tattoo of a different star constellation that allows them to transform into buffed up superheros who look like dancers from an eighties tech no music video they could also combined into a giant knight forty episodes were made the usa network clearly did not have the money to try to adapt a show from japan like power rangers did and made up this show on their own using the budget of a 1950s scifi film the fights scenes are generic the special effects are poor and some of the sets look like they could fall down the actors pretty much realized how ridiculous the show was and pretty much ham it up and overact i can only imagine their shock when the show was cancel led,negative,0
i was very impressed with with this film which was directed by luigi bazzoni the story was about a young woman translator who suddenly has lost all memory of the last three days and has suffered nightmares about astronauts on the moon she can not explained how this has happened to anyone one day a postcard arrives for her from the island of garma where she goes to visit strangely though people seem to know her even though she has never been there before also her dreams of astronauts on the moon come back to her  i thought that this was a very strange italian movie that seemed very haunting at times and there was also strange images in the film that seemed to stay with you throughout the the time you were watching the film i would recommend this film to people just to see how good it is highly recommended,positive,1
ed gein one of the most famous serial killers of all time he was the inspiration for famous movie killers like norman bates leatherface and buffalo bill he is also one of the most sick and disturbing killers of all time i watched a documentary on him so i know his story pretty well when i saw this i was curious because i thought it was supposed to be like a documentary reenactment but i have to say that this was just a pathetic waste of time first off the facts are completely wrong with a few minor exceptions and secondly this was just a stupid hollywood story when these horrific murders really happened and they just made it into a cheap buck not to mention that if they were going to make it into a horror movie this was poorly acted   ed gein he lives in a small town in wisconsin called plainfield but he has a little secret that the whole town is being effected by he digs up dead bodies as well as brutally murdering people bobby a deputy is on the case to get ed gein only no one knows who the killer is at first just finding crime scene after crime scene but things get personal when ed starts messing with the policemens family and friends  of course this movie was just ridicules and completely insulting to the true story i always thought that bad acting is a necessary tool to a horror flick but for this story it should have been a better acted film not to mention it should have been more of a documentary than a stupid clichéd horror film please stay away from this film its completely pathetic and untrue to the story of ed gein  110,negative,0
nothing positive to say meandering nonsense huffing and puffing with a message new russian postsoviet films can be very good cuckoo comes to mind yet many have the bouquet of cardboard and the aftertaste of asbestos nochnoi dozor would be a good example this is a dozor type of emptiness acting would be horrible if not for the saving grace of utterly unappealing direction and incompetent editing that sometimes is so awful that it distracts from the impotence of the actors special award to the cameraman for making sure that every shot is shaky would someone please realize that blair witch has had its 15 seconds of undeserved fame and takes are geared towards attentiondeficit preteens who subside on counterstrike and masturbation the female lead poses and tries to look seductive too often male antihero need a diction coach although genetics arent bad rather expressive eyes one middle finger for this irrelevant pile of nonart anyone who reviews this positively better be a distant cousin of the auteurs,negative,0
the movie is absolutely silly  but were you expecting a highbrow intellectual film based on a comic called slam dunk really jay chous acting isnt exactly the most moving thing ive ever seen but i certainly enjoyed the movie was it somewhere near the level of awesome that someone like jet li or stephen chow can produce no not really was it thoroughly entertaining if youre just taking it at surface value absolutely its a movie about some chinese eyecandy idols and musicians who can play basketball at an unreal level of expertise theres an evil triadstyle dude and a wacky scheming guy who gets jay chou involved in all of this a love interest its formulaic but really suspend disbelief for a while come on its called kung fu dunk what do you really think you signed on for do yourself a favor if you watch it  i found myself a copy with some engrish subtitles that made the movie nigh unintelligible conversation wise but we got a great laugh out of it they would appear to be extremely fixated on jerusalem and the numbers 1 10  i laughed i cried i hurled id watch it again  especially for that fight scene in the bar well choreographed and well shot i especially enjoy the plexiglass lit pool table  id love to play on one of those  slick enough for me but i dig on trash cinema,positive,1
i really enjoyed this movie about the relationships that sometimes developed between american servicemen and japanese women in postwar japanas well as the obstacles that prejudices created for them brando goes from having contempt for the japanese which is natural considering ww2 to falling in love with a japanese woman and wanting to marry her his performance is okay i am not a major fan of his acting style and the movie is marvelous throughout red buttons received an oscar for his touching performance of another gi who falls in love in japan though the japanese women who plays opposite him also did a remarkable job  i dont want to spoil it but the movie is a good one to watch with a box of tissues  this movie manages to say something and be entertaining at the same time a mostly underrated gem,positive,1
the royal rumble has traditionally been one of my favourite events and ive been a wrestling fan for a good few years now the other shows may have better matches but ive always found the actual rumble match to be full of excitement  im not going to reveal the winners of any match as i dont see it as fair to ruin the results on a review i will comment on the quality of them though  we have the standard 4 matches and then the big rumble event two from smackdown and two from raw  shawn michaels and edge open up for raw this proves to be a good match from two talented guys this is a match id recommend watching its hard to sum up without giving away the winner  next we have the usual undertaker against some big nasty monster be whoever it is giant gonzales yokozuna kamala well this time its heidenreich its also a casket match typical undertaker fare watch if youre a fan i have to admit i am purely for the entertainment factor it can hardly be regarded as a classic wrestling match  the next two matches are the title matches for once smackdown manages to upstage raw their title match is pretty thrilling and enjoyable but with a anticlimax and let down to end it raws match is a pretty dull and boring affair which is a pity as im a fan of both guys involved  now to the main reason i love the event the rumble its a pretty good one this year coming up to the event we all had a pretty good idea of who might win and it may not prove a big surprise but hey its very enjoyable there are the usual diverse ways of people being eliminated there is the token guy who doesnt make it to the ring the entrant who is ridiculous and we all want to see vanquished and someone gets eliminated by a previously eliminated combatant it has its usual highs and lows and i loved the ending in particular the vince mcmahon entrance  id recommend this show not the wwe on top form but its still good add it to your collection,positive,1
i first saw this film when i was around 6 or 7 years old and didnt really think it was anything particularly special as time went on i watched it a few more times and it started to grow on me as i started to understand the morals of the film which i will come to later for a while i left this film alone and didnt watch it for a while when looking for an old classic film to watch a few weeks ago now being 15 i dug out the vhs of homeward bound after watching this i was left on a natural high that i couldnt really explain the film gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never really expect the films nature of three completely different animals collaborating together to find their way home really sends a message home that no matter how different you are you can always find common ground something that you all need the way the personalities of the characters is chosen is truly fantastic in that you have an old knowledgeable wise golden retriever looking after or guiding chance the fun loving if slightly clumsy young american bulldog with sassy the clever vulnerable but confident cat the film follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistically impossible it creates magic in that you start to believe that this journey can happen   i dont want to sound like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to films i assure you i am quite the opposite but the most uplifting part of this film is without a doubt shadows return when shadow desperately tries to escape and chance and sassy painfully are told by him to leave when both animals return to their beloved owners there is a silence until shadow limps over the horizon to the awe of all there is a fine line between heartwarming and corny rubbish but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15 this film may not be lord of the rings but for disney to produce such a fantastic film using animals and for it to uplift myself in the way it does even at this age it deserves 1010,positive,1
if theres one word i can associate to this movie its embarrassment it must be embarrassing to everyone associated with the movie to actually watch it in a theatre everything  the script screenplay dialogues song lyrics direction  shoddy lousy  saw this movie when i was a kid liked it then mainly because it was a fantasy a superheromovie its a notsoexplored genre in hindi cinema the attempt deserves credit but thats all there is to it sashi kapoor seems to have been in a great hurry in making the movie cant understand the reason behind casting foreigners as hindispeaking characters who cant even get the sync right nothing to say about the dubbing the screenplay is terrible the editing even more if one follows the dialogues closely one can detect grammaticallywrong sentences which completely alter the intended meaning nothing special about the music  the biggest embarrassment must be for the censor board there are a couple of nipslip scenes in the movie one of which is absolutely clear so much so that i cant even think of a metaphor the director missed them the editing team missed it and the censor board missed it too so much for the noindecentexposureon screen motto the officials probably fell asleep while watching the movie  cant think of why amitabh went with the role it might be because he was a good friend of the kapoors but the role hardly has anything for him with wonderful roles in hum and agneepath behind him he couldnt have followed it up with a worse one there are a couple of heroic scenes really worthy ones but otherwise theyre embarrassingly unbelievable arrowcatching for instance it probably couldve been better with cgi but it was 91  dimple and sonam do not exactly set the screen on fire shammi kapoor and rishi kapoor give an inspired performance but their scope is limited amrish puri is his usual self in the role of a fairytale villain letting out the villainous laugh every now and then  on the whole an interesting concept could have been a lot more better,negative,0
when a small town is threatened by a child killer a lady police officer goes after him by pretending to be his friend as she becomes more and more emotionally involved with the murderer her psyche begins to take a beating causing her to lose focus on the job of catching the criminal not a film of high voltage excitement but solid police work and a good depiction of the faulty mind of a psychotic loser,positive,1
shut the front door thats what i said when i was told that blockbuster got a new movie in called snakes on a train okay maybe thats not exactly what i said but you get the point i didnt need to know who was in the movie or anything else all i knew was that i am renting this movie  i probably should have asked what it was about though in retrospect i dont know if i would have really wanted to watch a movie about a mayan curse that causes a woman to give internal birth to snakes and have them spit out of her mouth nor would i want to see a movie that features a guy who looks strangely enough like a pedophilic version of leif garrett  anyways while the curse might be interesting on some levels well maybe not there was still promise of these annoying characters getting eaten or at the very least killed by snakes so i was willing to sit through the first hour of very little happening other than a texas ranger forcing a girl into a nice little titty grope so she can keep her cocaine or the hispanic shaman that likes to occasionally stab people but then all hell broke loose and the girl started to spit out more and more snakes  spoiler alert so everythings going well at the end and im willing to overlook the fact that some of these snakes all of the sudden turned out to be 25 feet long after all people are getting eaten so its all good but then all of the sudden and im not going to tell you how because that would ruin the best part one of the snakes is about 300 feet long then it proceeds to squeeze and devour the train with all the graphic artistry of serpentaur from the old gi joe cartoons unfortunately i could not make a nemesis enforcer connection with this movie anyways so you would think that a snake that big who ate a train would be pretty unstoppable well not if you know your mayan voodoo rocks and have the ability to summon tornadoes from heaven yeah thats all ill say about that  in short this movie is bad really bad to the point where you might be numb after watching this or your brain might hurt i didnt give this a one because no matter how stupid it was it still wasnt as bad as date movie so if you like camp or badly constructed b horror movies this is the one for you if you think this will actually be cool like its bigger more infamous brethren just walk away from the box if you see it and ill leave you with a quote from the movie that should basically sum it all up  snakes cant get on a train because thats just silly not like they make stops or anything,negative,0
ok ill be honest when i first saw the trailer for the programme i thought it was an advert for some sunscreen product with all the people walking around on the beach despite this i decided to watch it thinking it would be some new show i could laugh at but i was seriously amazed  from the first 10 seconds of the program i was hooked why is he lying in the trees why did the plane crash etc etc  its not everyday that a show comes along which combines intelligence humour action and suspense but lost manages all of this with a great cast and crew beautiful locations and pretty decent special effects lost will catch anyone who tunes in and is a must see for anyone whos sick of cheesy sitcoms and crappy reality tv  lost is on tuesdays at 10 on channel 4 uk 4 8 15 16 23 42 o,positive,1
i remember this show from swedish television i was only 7 years of age and it scared me beyond belief  i would love to revisit this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed  although this was released before alien and a plethora of other spacethrillers i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the 50s and the political climate of the 70s when i think of it this was a real scifi a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are the term scifi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has spaceships in them,positive,1
i had to watch this film because the plot was so outrageous and the film lived up to expectations in fact it makes for quite uncomfortable viewing at times unlike other meyer films the sexual antics are down to a minimum some of the scenes of violence are unnecessarily gratuitous and offensive the plot is chaotic and some of the acting and lines are dreadful  the film is a strange combination of sadomasochistic fantasy combined with a window of the brutality and immorality of the slavery and fails on all counts its as though meyer was trying to make up for the sexploitation blackploitation by having a higher moral message meyer knows we feel a bit guilty about getting turned on by the blatant dominatrix connotations of the early scene showing lady susan wielding a whip in a provocative outfit he then tries to steer back to the righteous path by turning it into a film about the triumph of good over evil however because they cancel each other out you end up with nothing  because it so bad in so many ways it is actually worth watching if you appreciate the art of making an awful film in the worst possible taste perhaps because it is so bad we almost let meyer get away with the unacceptable,negative,0
i went to this film full of hope with so many capable and humorous actors headed up by sir ben i thought this is going to be a little treat  oh how i felt like gouging my eyes out as the credits rolled that i had wasted 93mins of my life this film that was clearly doa there are some real problems with this film and it will probably be easier to list them 1 no jokes i am not particularly hard to please comedically  high or low brow  but there really is not one laugh in this film  2 sir ben mumbles through every single line whether he is supposed to be drunk or not 3 there is no effort to to begin let alone develop the relationship between the love interests in this 2 people bumping into each other randomly in the street would instantly have more rapport  4 all the acting talent that is assembled is completely wasted dont be fooled into watching this because of the names  5 for a cold ass hitman he rubbed out more people in gandhi than this flaccid waste of time a by the way dyed beards look really creepy i was hoping that this was a slow burner but in the end the only thing that could inject any life  and justice  into this is frank pulling out his 9 and offing the whole cast starting with tea and ending with himself  sorry it was that bad,negative,0
it is difficult to evaluate this or any other comparable film of the early sound era in terms that one might use for ordinary film commentary at times there is almost a desperation as many film personalities of the silent era try their wings at sound surely fearing that they will be left by the wayside as did happen to some rintintin however was pertfectly natural in such a vaudeville of unrelated sequences some were sure to stand out john barrymores soliloquy from richard ii is a moment certainly worth preserving by and large only those with earlier stage training exuded confidence however this is over all reasonably entertaining and a must for film buffs especially interested in the silent to sound transition,positive,1
seeing this movie in previews i thought it would be witty and in good spirits unfortunately it was a standard case of the funny bits were in the preview not to say it was all bad but the good bits were in the preview  if you are looking for an adolescent movie that will put you to sleep then watch this movie,negative,0
while this was a better movie than 101 dalmations live action not animated version i think it still fell a little short of what disney could do it was wellfilmed the music was more suited to the action and the effects were better done compared to 101 the acting was perhaps better but then the human characters were given far more appropriate roles in this sequel and glenn close is really not to be missed as in the first movie she makes it shine her poor lackey and the overzealous furrier sidekicks are wonderful characters to play off of and they add to the spectacle disney has given us this is a great family film with little or no objectionable material and yet it remains fun and interesting for adults and children alike its bound to be a classic as so many disney films are heres to hoping the third will be even better still because you know they probably want to make one ,positive,1
please dont kill me im just an actor can you play dead its difficult to describe this show its like a crime dramedy where the bad cop is an ass literally whats great about the show is some of assys perfectly awful oneliners cracking out such gems as adios blimp assy mcgee provides some great laughs at points sadly at other times the show seems to drag along at a slow pace making it almost hard to watch this is definitely the kind of show youll love or hate theres essentially no middleman its not the best show on adult swim but it has some strong points its worth looking into just to see if you enjoy it i know i did,positive,1
william shakespeare probably didnt envision stephanos as a gay doctor antonio as a faithless wife or caliban as a goatherd with a trinitron but the bards had worse done to his good work over time and might even enjoy the sumptuous pageant of life that is his tempest as reconfigured by paul mazursky and cowriter leon capetanos  this time prospero is philip dimitrius john cassevetes a manhattanbased architect tired of designing atlantic city casinos for the amiable mafioso alonso vittorio gassman especially after discovering alonso is carrying on an affair with philips wife antonia gena rowlands along with daughter miranda molly ringwald philip escapes to a remote greek island with miranda and his new mistress aretha susan sarandon a nice catholic girl who struggles with philips celibate lifestyle will a sudden storm bring all right in the end  heres a thought on the career of cassevetes how many other actors could make a film so confused into something so riveting a darling of film critics for his earlier work often with his reallife wife rowlands he presents a central character who really suffers for his art here but seems to enjoy himself and makes us enjoy him too its not prospero but something rich and strange that makes for a terrific sea change all his own  its all here he tells one of his faithful companions arethas dog nino beauty magic inspiration and serenity that it is tempest transfers 1611 london to 1982 manhattan and finds some nice resonances in philips displaced life show me the magic he calls out to a stormtossed city skyscape and mazurskys version augmented by donald mcalpines sterling cinematography of purple seascapes and naturally sunburnished greek landscapes does just that  its not a perfect movie by any means in fact the big finale which is the only part of the movie that follows shakespeares storyline to any faithful extent is a mess rowlands character is hard to care much for in this film and after meeting sarandon in all her braless glory its hard to understand philips continuing concern for his wife let alone his leftfield desire to make an unhappy sacrifice in order to restore the natural order of things  but theres a lot to love about tempest in addition to cassavetes theres ringwalds film debut as his loyal but restless daughter here as in the play an object of desire for the primitive rustic kalibanos raul julia ringwald here is very much the same teenaged muse of privileged adolescence that would inspire john hughes but with an emotional depth those later hughes films didnt delve into ringwald and julia never got any oscar attention but they both would win golden globes for their playful work here he tries to woo her in her island isolation with his tv reruns of gunsmoke in greek tempted by her 15yearold body  i want to balonga you with my bonny johnny kalibanos declares getting shoved aside but winning our sympathy anyway especially after performing new york new york with a chorus of goats when tempest hit the screens julia was the toast of broadway as the lead in nine  its mazurskys show even if it feels at times that cassavetes is running things with improvisational line readings and emotional breakdowns galore philip introduces himself to aretha by telling her im right in the middle of a nervous breakdown he plays his character as an amiable obsessive seeking to crystallize his happiness by building an theater in his otherwise uninhabited island  adding to the enjoyment is gassmans rich performance as the other man who is as completely amiable as julia while telling a youthobsessed philip boys dont have half as much fund as we have theyre nervousand they make love in the back of an old sports car despite being overlong and pretentious in spots like so many art films tempest is entertaining in its excesses and a trip very much like shakespeare intended even if his dreams didnt involve smoking pot backstage at a gogos concert,positive,1

i was fully amped up to see this film i had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in new zealand i shouldnt have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt clarks worst film there is so much wrong with this film first off some of the acting is great in particular nick stahl as the bully and the girl with the curly brown hair i cant recall her name but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable especially leo fitzpatrick hes a veteran of clarks films now and he was so brilliant in kids but in bully he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually the screenplay felt like it had been written by a first year film student no sorry a high school studentone who has never seen a movie before and i couldnt fathom clarks intentions was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kids existence it sure as hell didnt stop him getting in a damn good perv im no prude but i didnt need to see teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes i still maintain that clarks best film is another day in paradise its fantastic and i dont think hell ever top it,negative,0

as you can guess by my rating and my title of this review that i dont like johnny test now i think i know what people are going to say  how do you know how bad it is have you ever watched it i did watch this show a couple times because i am studying film and animation and this just doesnt hold a candle to my standards  i want to first talk about the animation because it is one of the most confusing things i have ever seen like the first two seasons or only first season had hand drawn animation i thought it was a nice show to look at when it was hand drawn but then it switched to flash animation and the quality went down by a huge amount  so that is one strike in my eyes but lets look at the story of the show it tries way too hard to be like dexters lab but there are differences because instead of one red headed scientist there is two and they are both female there is a talking dogwhy and the parents attitudes are switched somewhat i have others but i dont think i can write them here  i dont mean cursing but i mean i dont know if there is a limit for words everything else though is spot on even a deedee character johnny himself it just tries so hard to be dexter but it just seems to me like a heartless knockoff  lastly i want to talk about the jokes remember in dexters lab some of the jokes involved yelling yes yelling can be good for a joke or two but dexters lab also had sly remarks that made me have to go back and check to get the joke johnny test just forgets all that and just yells 50 of the time and stops the music whenever a stupid joke or one liner appears that isnt comedy thats stupid comedy i know what some people are thinking isnt three stooges stupid comedy watch that and johnny test back to back and you laugh more at the first option sometimes the jokes are based on bizarre situations which like chowder makes me mad i have a rule for cartoons and comedies all together to much bizarre doesnt equal comedy it makes you just think what am i watching  so it strikes out on all accounts dont watch this show if you have any respect for comedy in anyway shape or form,negative,0
i am a big fan of the movie but not for the usual reasons i think travolta and winger performed at higher than average rates i think the sets were representative of the location and the era i liked the sound track and the charlie daniels band however i think the photography was amazing since the interior scenes were filmed in the actual club and gilleys had low ceilingsperhaps 1012 feet high and the smoke that was supposed to simulate a smokefilled bar hung 24 feet below the ceiling the camera managed to get shots through the smoke and focus on the actors the bull the bar the women the dancing the lowlevel of light that actually was in the bar what a feat sure there was auxiliary lighting but in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar it had to be lowlight shots ray villalobos the camera operator was outstanding he got some shots he had no hope of achieving and the impact of them brought a sense of reality to the film thanks raygreat work,positive,1
this movie could have been a lot better than it was if hadnt been a disney film i thought that the young girl playing shirley was all right you could tell that she was really trying to do the job right the teenage shirley temple wasnt right at all i think that they should have spent last time on her childhood the first hour should have been about the young shirley then the last hour should have been about the older shirley this was a boring movie and not a good shirley temple story,negative,0
this is my opinion of this movie expressed in its dialogs  to be more serious i cant say this movie is a bad moment but i didnt enjoy it either   first i was simply indifferent  couldnt get my mind into the apes world even though the makeup are very realistic the constant screaming was irritating may the film have changed apes for cats and its a cult movie for me in relation to my fondness of the latter  the second part is more interesting with the talent and freshness of then newcomers macdowell  lambert but i felt alienated all the story is located in a big british mansion no matter how luxurious is it it was like a prison for me  at last it could be a good adaptation of the burroughs story of tarzan  i dont know having never read the book or seen the disney   in conclusion i dont have any good moments to remember so one viewing would be enough for me   i should have guessed my boredom after the endless freeze called overture at the beginning whats the meaning only the director knows it,negative,0
theres a lot going on in the college girl murders a mad scientist creates an almost undetectable poisonous gas before he can reap the rewards of his discovery the scientist is killed by a hooded whipwelding monk after a coed is killed in a church by the gas scotland yard is called in to investigate but the killing continues who can stop this mad killer who seems to be able to come and go as he pleases in and out of the college   what works    the killer whats not to like about a killer who sneaks around wearing a vivid red kkk looking outfit complete with red gloves the white whip he carries and uses very effectively stands out nicely against the bright red gown although the idea of a killer in a flaming red pointyhead outfit sneaking around a girls school is fairly farfetched its one of the more sinister looking costumes ive seen   groovy 60s music i really would like to track down the title music to the college girl murders its got a jazzy hip 60s feel to it that i just loved   bizarre touches beyond the killers red gown and hood the movie features a sliding fireplace a pit of alligators with a cage handing overhead poison spraying bibles a strategically placed mannequin miniskirts gogo boots and mile high hair i would describe it as a cross between the 60s batman tv show and an italian giallo the college girl murders is a real treat for the eye   the end lets just say that there are more twists than a mountain road just when you think the killer has been uncovered here comes a twistand anotherand anotherand another  what doesnt work    chief inspector sir john i know the guy was meant to be comic relief but his buffoonish character has way too much screen time   why have alligators previously i mentioned the alligators in the pit and while they are a nice touch they serve very little purpose why go through all the trouble and not use them    plodding plot some of the college girl murders has no flow or rhythm to it there are far too many moments throughout the movie when things come inexplicably to a screeching halt better pacing would have made this a much more enjoyable movie  i havent seen many of these german krimis but of the few i have seen phantom of soho strangler of blackmoor castle dead eyes of london this may be my favorite this one has a real funky feel to it that i really go into had the plot flowed a little better i could have easily given the college girl murders a 710,positive,1
this is a gem as a film four production  the anticipated quality was indeed delivered shot with great style that reminded me some errol morris films well arranged and simply gripping its long yet horrifying to the point its excruciating we know something bad happened one can guess by the lack of participation of a person in the interviews but we are compelled to see it a bit like a car accident in slow motion the story spans most conceivable aspects and unlike some documentaries did not try and refrain from showing the grimmer sides of the stories as also dealing with the guilt of the people don left behind him wondering why they didnt stop him in time it took me a few hours to get out of the melancholy that gripped me after seeing this verywell made documentary,positive,1
it may interest people to know that this film was made without any recourse to phoolan devi herself and when she did finally see parts of it was so enraged that she announced that the film was not to be shown in india or she would cover herself in petrol and set fire to herself i do not know whether it was shown at all or not but given her standing at the time as a rising politician i doubt it since then i saw a report that she has been ousted from office and charged with further crimes from her dacoit days and has gone into hiding as a result  her own concerns aside this is an excellent film made all the more so by its refreshingly brutal approach none of the rosetinted melodrama one might expect from a typical indian film it should be stressed that concerns about how feminist the films messages really are and the like are essentially irrelevant its a true story her misgivings are it seems not with what is depicted but with the way in which the film depicts her,positive,1
in 1961 this series was shown on local tv here in southern california i and many others have been petering bbc for tape or dvd ever since now all of a sudden here it is on amazon i preordered in january and now here on march 30 it arrived it was a long wait 48 years was it worth it so far i have just watched richard ii ive only had the dvd since 2 oclock and i can truly say yea totally worth the wait the acting direction and production are superb and even better than i remember the production is in b  w but somehow it fits the video is clear and very good the sound is flawless further proof of how timeless shakespeare truly is  i gave this 10 stars even though i have only seen 1 of the 8 plays i am sure that when i have seen them all i will change my rating to at least a 12  its currently in stock at amazon us region 1 at a reasonable price  id better stop now so i can get back to watching next up is henry the iv part 1 of which is my all time favorite shakespeare play,positive,1
considering the film’s reputation as truly the worst of the worst i was looking forward to watching wood’s crappus opus my word it’s not necessarily any more inept than the other woods i’ve watched – however being from the reefer madness 1938 school of filmmaking glen or glenda doesn’t come across as readily ‘enjoyable’ as his genre efforts  also this surely emerges as horror legend bela lugosi’s nadir his first of three ‘collaborations’ with the director one wonders whether he was really aware what kind of film it was considering the actor’s history of heavy medication and the sheer senselessness of his cameo besides lugosi’s idiosyncratic delivery is perhaps at its most awkward here…though wood’s script is mostly to blame for this – given the impossible dialogue with repeated nonsensical allusions to “puppydog tails” and “big fat snails” he handed the ailing star by the way wood himself plays the central role under the pseudonym daniel davis – and being just as worthless in this area proves to have been an allround dog dolores fuller – his wife and costar – was similarly untalented she would also appear in jail bait 1954…but at the very least the image where the latter finally lets glen wear her angora sweater did give tim burton’s affectionate biopic ed wood 1994 its famous poster   incidentally the latter film features a presumably fictionalized meeting between wood and orson welles – well for all intents and purposes glen or glenda constitutes ed wood’s citizen kane 1941 given its gleeful propensity for gimmicky narrative techniques in fact the barest thread of plot is padded with stock footage galore many of it irrelevant such as the bewildering instances of sm and inane dream sequences highlighted by the presence of an impish demon sporting outrageous bushy eyebrows that would make martin scorsese weep with envy the film’s sincere attempt at a plea for tolerance and psychological probing into the afflictionphenomenon of transvestism is however sabotaged at every turn by the sheer amateurishness of the approach  for what it’s worth the edition i watched was the “extended reissue version” which included six minutes of ‘depraved’ footage directed by w merle connell censored on original release furthermore my copy went outofsynch every so often which forced me to rewind it slightly to get the audio back on track – though thankfully this was the fault of the source conversion to divx as opposed to the film itself,negative,0
i get a kick out of the new who fans who call it excellenttheir entitled to that opinion but the new series isnt quite there yet its getting there its definitely good  first the good things the special effects are obviously better nearly 20 yrs later since the last episode of doctor who battlefield was aired  one thing the bbc has always liked is doctor who except when they tried to cancel in the 70s and 80s however the anticipation and the pressure was great but i think the new series has passed the test its good its still not excellent because it does have its flaws some of the stories dalek were very poor i assume it was written in a couple of minutes by some idiot who never bothered to remake the dalek character or never bothered to watch the old series  aliens in london was by far probably the best episode so far it started a new storyline about aliens which has lasted across several episodes including boomtown  now the other bad things the companion rose billie piper isnt great shes actually quite annoying but as is dr who a young teeny bopper had to be eventually chosen and she got the part  christopher eccleston is pretty respectable hes started to catch his niche he tried to play the character straight then funny always missing the right punchline but hes taken it much more serious and it shows  continuity wise there still some issues that didnt get resolved well paul mcgann was still the doctor before this but he didnt get put back  aside from that though the series overall is pretty good i havent missed an episode and it never gets boring so i recommend any doctor who fan to check it out and see the new doctor who series,positive,1
i never saw any of john leguizamos standup before i watched freak and after seeing it again on hbo comedy recently it was better more enlivening and with things that at the age of 14 i couldnt understand quite before spike lee did a wonderful job directing keeping the visual angle up to par with leguizamos theatrics and the style of personal storytelling its substance and style merging together but unobtrusively we get leguizamos rants about race and sex the bits about sex are classic but a lot of it is about family and what sticks still fresh in my mind is about his father even when things get dark in some of the stories theres something fresh or crazy or random that leguizamo pulls out to get a laugh and it works more often than not if something does fall flat for me at any rate it might be his personality tics here and there but overall its the kind of fun material that isnt heady but is so true to itself that it stings find it if you can,positive,1
petter matteis love in the time of money is a visually stunning film to watch mr mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter   this being a variation on the arthur schnitzlers play about the same theme the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect each one is connected in one way or another to the next person but no one seems to know the previous point of contact stylishly the film has a sophisticated luxurious look we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat  the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter  the acting is good under mr matteis direction steve buscemi rosario dawson carol kane michael imperioli adrian grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these characters come alive  we wish mr mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work,positive,1
the golden era of disney cartoons was dying by the time the end of the 90s this show quack pack shouldnt even be considered a ducktales spin off because the show barely had anything to do with ducktales its about a teenaged huey dewey and louie as they make trouble for their uncle donald and talk in hiphop lingo and they are fully dressed unlike in ducktales i prefer the little adventurous nephews from ducktales there are humans in duckburg and the ducks are the only animals living in duckburg theres no references of scrooge mcduck the stories are repetitive the plot is boring but the animation is good if you want lots of slapstick humor i recommend this to you if you want a better disney show watch darkwing duck or ducktales,negative,0
okay this movie fck in rules it is without question one of the most technically inept pieces of cinema ever made absolutely terrible but you gotta see it rent this with your buddies and come up with a drinking game or just have fun its hilarious and the behindthescenes featurette proves it you can do anything with paper plates and finger paint awesome okay rent it just for this one scene two characters are actually walking in place for about 3 minutes in a shot the director on the commentary says yeah the tracking was so smooth it looks like theyre yeah right man they are totally walking in place its so funny,negative,0
i give this movie a 4 cause im a die hard fan of the video game series the graphics and animation are excellent and its nice to see the whole gang in cg form sephiroths still cool  now the reasons it only got a 4 well the characters feel like planks of wood with some of the worst voice acting ive ever seenive watched epic movie  the movie just seems cloud orientated so much so that it make even the fans embarrassed with cloud this and cloud that clouds mentioned so much that it make you not want to see him in this movie   the villains have the award for the worst villains ever i was more scared by the wicked witch of the west   all the other characters in this movie are simply put in the movie for a nod to the fans and doesnt take it further then that  wtfs with the chilly chally  summary waited 9 years for this movie and this is what i get a large pointless and boring cut scene i beg the head of square cenix to shoot the man responsible for this burn every copy of the movie and any one involved in it and create a new movie from the ashess it would be nice to make the movie in live action and based on the original game,negative,0
this is a great film for pure entertainment nothing more and nothing less its enjoyable and a vaguely feelgood movie  a minor but nonetheless irritating thing about the movie is that we dont know why justine and chas broke up okay most first relationships dont work for one reason or another but they more or less seemed like a nice couple  in a nutshell its worth a watch to escape reality,positive,1
françois traffauts mississippi siren had an unconvincing plot the screenplay required too much elasticity in suspension of disbelief the plot went at a glacial pace it started off in an interesting setting but soon drifted onto the shoals of melodrama that lacked logic or intelligence what were the critics thinking this one is overrated even to be described as a loser even catherine deneuvue who charmed in the umbrellas of cherbourg and belle doe jour managed to be simply annoying   we rented this movie at the same time as we rented another traffaut film we watched this one first and found it to be so bad that we sent the other one back unseen at the same time,negative,0
bette midler showcases her talents and beauty in diva las vegas i am thrilled that i taped it and i am able to view whenever i want to she possesses what it takes to keep an audience in captivity her voice is as beautiful as ever and will truly impress you the highlight of the show was her singing stay with me from her 1979 movie the rose you can feel the emotion in the song and will end up having goose bumps the show will leave you with the urge to go out and either rent a bette midler movie or go to the nearest music store and purchase one of bette midlers albums,positive,1
giallo fans seek out this rare film it is well written and full of all sorts of the usual low lifes that populate these films i dont want to give anything away so i wont even say anything about the plot the whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere and you dont know what to expect or who to suspect recommended the only place ive seen to get this film in english is from european trash cinema for 15,positive,1
the major fault in this film is that it is impossible to believe any of these people would ever be cast in a professional production of macbeth hearing david lansburys soft voice struggling laboriously with the famous tomorrow tomorrow and tomorrow speech made it impossible to believe anyone would ever consider him for the role i kept believing therefore that he didnt get the part because he was a lousy actor not because a bigger name was available then when we see portions of the play in rehearsal it is difficult to believe the director is not parodying things with a hopelessly miscast misdirected travesty of actors who are unable to articulate or even understand the verse and directors who see the play through their own screwball interpretations sometimes directors are so anxious to have their films done and writers think they have the ability to direct their own worksthat they settle for less this appears to be such an example,negative,0
i loved this movie  the actors were wonderful and suited their roles the story itself was great and true the setting was perfect and the message about human response to the war danger and risk was exceptional the person who wrote the music score also did the music for life is beautiful another favourite of mine his comment was apparently that this was not a like an english movie it was like an italian movie i think hes right callum blue is perfect for the part of eric newby i recommend this movie to everyone who wants to watch a story that is true and morally uplifting as well as a beautiful love story,positive,1
no offense to anyone who saw this and liked it but i hated it it dragged on and on and there was not a very good plot also too simple and the acting was so so  i would give this snorefest a 2 at the most,negative,0
to be fair i couldnt bear to watch this movie all the way thru so i have no idea if it suddenly gets better half way thru the film but the first 30 minutes or so are amongst the worst i have seen in a while children under twelve might get a kick out of the poorly written acted and directed slapstick humor but adults in full control of all their faculties should steer clear of this stinker,negative,0
i am a big fan of karishma kapoor and govinda i watched this film after i had seen fiza which was absolutley brilliant  there are films that are bad and there are films that are crp but this film just takes the biscuit  we were so annoyed that we were conned out of paying our money expecting a decent film  avoid at all cost dont even rent it  110,negative,0
please note that i havent seen the film since i discovered it in 2007 and my town is smaller and doesnt carry it however i really want to say something about it im actually doing research for university on the title character richard maurice bucke and would like to point out that the person they based the main character on was in reality completely different hollywoods ideas of people and artistic license granted the real dr bucke totally endorsed hysterectomies to cure insanity in women and would never have practiced anything as liberal as represented in the film i think its laughable to see various film critics who write for legitimate newspapers who say this film has some historical basis the only actual fact i can see is the friendship between dr bucke and walt whitman please dont waste your time on a film with such a disregard to the horror that real women experienced at the hands of this doctor who has now been glorified by the film industry,negative,0
i have some of the older videos and dvds of dr who ive played them over and over i adore each of the doctors for different reasons but due to a man in the bbc hierarchy dr who was canceled even though it was still one of the mainstays of the bbc lineup with the departure of sylvester mccoy the doctor stayed alive through the fans bbc graciously allowed fans to write books and cartoons the momentum of dr who has been steady even after 1989 then they took a chance with paul mcgann the movie was flawed but it gave the bbc an idea of what we wanted in 1999 the man was gone and the newbies at the bbc felt it was time to bring the doctor back it was a complete success here in america the scifi channel took a chance and it has become a complete success as well although the writers were having to start over and explain the dr who mythology for new viewers it is incredible to me that they have done it in season 1 staring christopher eccleston with russell t davis as lead writer and phil collinson as producer the doctor has come back to us and in each episode we learn more about who the doctor is the doctor who universe has always been about choice love and sacrifice this is what they provided it makes me want more and it saddens me that mr eccleston has chosen to leave the show my first doctor was doctor no 3 jon pertwees doctor mr eccleston neednt worry about his position in the dr who universe it is as solid as the rest he is the 9th doctor i didnt know of mr eccleston prior to his performance in dr who but i do now i wish there was some way he could know there is push out in the dr who fan community to find his other work and enjoy it we have already seen that he is a great actor,positive,1
great movie the sound track is awesome very relaxing sound elton was ahead of his own time even back in 1971 lewis gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film the movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air the sound tracks written by sir elton complimented the movie to a t rex morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song honey roll and poem i meant to do my work today by richard le gallienne was incredible kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film it was no surprise that a lot of the people involved with this movie went on to become the best in their field,positive,1
superb i had initially thought that given amrita pritams communist leanings and dr dwivedis nationalist leanings film will be more frank than novel but when i read the novel i was surprised to find that it was reverse  kudos to marita pritam for not being pseudosec and to dr dwivedi to be objective this movie touches a sensitive topic in a sensitive way casualty of any war are women as some poet said and this movie personifies it it is also a sad commentary on hindu psyche as they cant stand up against kidnappers of their girls or the hindu brother who can only burn the fields of his tormentor on the other hand it also shows economic angles behind partition or in fact why girls were kidnapped in the first place i think kidnappers thought that by kidnapping girls they will become legal owners of the houses and thus new govt will not be able to ask them to return the houses this apart one has to salute the courage of characters of puro and her bhabhi they are two simple village girls unmindful of outside world and risk everytihng by trying to come back after being dishonored  because there are many documented cases when such women were not accepted by their families in india  no wonder that it required a woman to understand the pains of other women,positive,1
i dont know why but when i am asked about bad movies i have seen i often think of the air up there i know that technically lots of movies are horrible compared to it and i have seen worse acting its just that its so bland so predictable in a word mediocre,negative,0
the salena incident is by far the director dustin rikerts best film  which isnt saying much in his past films and i use the term films loosely the director takes ideas from hollywood blockbusters and severely marginalizes them the salena incident is no different the movie is basically con air meets aliens done with the semblance of your average film school production the film is riddled with outoffocus shots and plagued by special effects that would have trouble rivaling most high school computer animation classes for example almost every onscreen explosion is the same fire effect matted over the screen  the weak effects and production value are only compromised by a flawed plot and rocky dialogue in a sentence the story strings together like an exposition of overused hollywood clichés the movie begins with the worst cgi alien ship ever made crashing into the worst cgi earth ever made and a team of army somethings going down to investigate next a bus of prison transports carrying the worst of the worst from across the state is overthrown by the prisoners with the help of their blonde girlfriends armed with silicon implants the prisoners escape and run into the town of salena where they encounter the aliens who shock have escaped from an alien prison transport carrying the worst of the worst from across the galaxy the prisoners and their captive police armed with only guns and sad puns have to fight off the aliens and escape the town before the international space alliance rolls eyes bombs the city into oblivion  the only real enjoyable parts of the movie are when the actors who are clearly undermined by the script are given the freedom to improvise and also when they fight off the smaller of the alien creatures in a flurry of gun fire other than that the movie really isnt worth anyones time let alone the plastic that the dvd is made out of how awful was it lets just say the secretary of defense is about 90 years old works in a room that is about as high tech 1950s real estate office and is wearing a looney tunes tie yes if that wasnt clear enough before the man in charge of the pentagon is wearing a tie with bugs bunny and the road runner on it the movie basically culminates hahahahhaaa did i say culminates with the last remaining soldier running into the group of prisoners and guards and the new formed team fighting their way away from the vicious aliens  which for some strange reason leads them straight back to the alien ship yeah  the movie has heart but is riddled with horrible direction and even worse camera work someone seriously needed to slap the dp and tell him there is more to cinematography than repetitive stagnant chestlevel shots this movie really isnt worth renting if it ever makes it that far being that its not as horribly bad as the last films made by the director which reduces the laughability but its nowhere near watchable cinema,negative,0
i cannot get past the message of this movie its laid out much too clearly to ignore and it is obscene because it has lost its sense of what its about i havent read the novel but pollacks film opens with a scene at a ciafront organization in new york which is broken into by two professional assassins headed by max von sydow who proceed to brutally slaughter the half dozen quirky staff members weve come to know and understand the staff include an elderly female receptionist a fussy elderly professorial guy whos toupee falls off when he is machinegunned is that a joke and last the beautiful tina chen who looks up from the copier realizes she is about to be murdered and says pitifully brave i wont scream von sydow replies sympathetically i know these murders are completely unexpected savage unmotivated by anything that we are aware of and graphic it is a brutal scene   there is absolutely no way in which von sydow and his henchman can be redeemed and yet that is exactly what pollack tries to do towards the end  after having killed these innocent good guys von sydow switches sides because the other side is willing to pay him and assassinates the evil mastermind behind a complicated intramural cia plot the script then turns him into a perfectly reasonable sensitive human being it is better to live in europe things are not so rushed or whatever i swear im not making this up pollack wants us to believe that it is better to be an honest mass murderer than a crooked bureaucrat thats the message you should write it down in case you forget just exactly what kind of psychiatric shambles do you have to be in order to turn ordinary values not to mention common sense upsidedown like that i understand that there are thoughtful adults who dislike the government of the united states even hate it and who see conspiracies just about everywhere providing a kneejerk explanation for otherwise unexplainable events i know that people who think this way exist because i number some of them among my closer friends nevertheless at some point this dislike this hatred if it increases in intensity must pass beyond politics or ethics and into the realm of the psychiatric i dont for a moment believe that a man who murders people for money is better than a sinister government official i dont care how suave and cultured the murderer is or whether he knows how to reach the louvre on the metro whoever is purveying that message needs either medication or meditation  id like to be able to argue that the production is as thoroughly rotten as its message but i cant its quite well done in some ways thats worse because it makes the film less dismissable even new york city looks photogenic on the screen and its been a long time since ive thought of new york as photogenic robert redford does an admirable job of projecting his characters initial shock and confusion but then turns into a telecommunicational semigenius and man he looks just fine his wardrobe is just right even his rimless glasses are becoming and his peacoat its not everyone who can make a navy pea jacket look glamorous he seems extremely handsome too the swine i want to look like that i want to wear a denim shirt and a tie with such panache faye dunaway is alright in her role but its not too believable a role would anybody eagerly sleep with a guy who has just kidnapped her and is holding her at gunpoint even if he did look like redford would anyone be emotionally wounded if when this ambivalent relationship is about to end redford asked her not to tell anybody about what happened cliff robertson is surprisingly good he does one or two extremely good doubletakes the mailman is superb the fight between him and redford in a crowded apartment is exquisitely choreographed and for once we really dont know for sure how it will turn out because redford a book reader after all seems mismatched against the brute cunning of this hired assassin this is one of john housemanns final roles a shame hes a magnet on screen and what an end to his life a friend finds him lost wandering the streets of new york in a neighborhood hed been familiar with for most of his life   yes the movie is very well executed but i cant ignore that vicious paranoid message i have the same problem with leni riefenstahls triumph of the will or her olympic documentary in which the announcer is watching a foot race in which jesse owens is pulling into the lead and says ominously this negro is dangerous,negative,0
i saw this film when it came out let me see nowthis guy who had earlier skied down mount fuji manages to accumulate the funding and hire personnel to document what sounds on the surface like a bold and daring actto ski down the worlds highest peak welland here comes the spoilerwhat happens see after a large crew of people manage to help him get near the topand a life is lost in the bargainhe gets on his skis manages to make it down a very very short way at which point his parachute opensand thats that and instead of burning the footage to hide this amazingly anticlimactic ending to an embarrassing debacle the guy goes ahead and releases it spoiler ends i do admire the amazing courage and effort it must have taken the film crew to get some of the stunning shots they got another spoileroh yes one of the sherpas is killed by falling into a crevasse the narrator who is quoting the daredevil skier casually remarks that according to the sherpa religion since this mans body cannot be recovered his soul will roam the world forever and never know rest is it worth it the narrator muses yes he answersbecause it served the purpose of letting this clown ski down everest i cant remember ever seeing a more meretricious piece of celluloid this is one to miss at all costs,negative,0
thats right a movie written directed and produced by fred tepper and family fred should have known better having worked the sets of titantic and dogma   so the plot there are some scientists and some forest rangers and a hot chick with huge fake breasts they are all really bad at their jobs including the hot chickwho i think is supposed to be a photographer but who cares because she wears a bikini one of the forest rangers comments that the scientists are professional people which is good because it would be horrible if they were professional grubs or jellybeans or ewoks  they are hiking through the woods in search of some strange apelike bones and no one even once mentions that the bones just might be those of the infamous bigfoot they just wander around and one of the rangers unabashedly hits on the hottie we all hope he dies real soon along with his sister whos meant to be the cute naive one but is really just annoying then they gasp find a sasqu i mean apelike animal burial ground of course no mentions that it might just be bigfoot bones theyre messing with i guess scientists and forest rangers just dont think about those types of things  then sasquatch and his tribe get really angry and kill all the people we dislike chases the other losers away and buries his great aunt muriel and cousin josh who died in an unfortunate trout accident all over again  insipid boring dialogue i zoned out several times inane plot unlikable characters bad cgi a man in a monkey suit would look better and acting that just wasnt very good all add up to make a movie i wont be watching again  you check it out though its good for some unintentional laughs,negative,0
im glad i didnt pay to see the wog boy  i sat there hopefully waiting for something original andor funny to happen  it reminded me very much of those predictable english comedies of the 1970s  i wont bother with a synopsis of the plot i suggest you do something else for 90 minutes  ,negative,0
here is another great film critics will love the problem is that it is not a very good movie  the films premise is simple nine convicts escape a prison after the tenth one goes crazy and tells them where the treasure is  the first half has a lot of slapstick some of it very broad while the second half is a character driven descent into fantasy and melancholy  the two halves simply dont mix individual scenes do work very well the guys crashing a friends house who has a new filipino bride is hilarious while a later scene with the big guy working in the restaurant tugs at the heartstrings they simply dont mesh with each other  the movie as well is missing entire setups one scene shows the guys desperately looking for change under a deserted vending machine to buy a snack the very next scene has the whole crew in drag sitting down in a restaurant where did they get the dresses and wigs the crew includes both the big guy and a midget how did they get all the clothes and money to buy the meal and most puzzling is why are they in drag they are clearly guys in drag and lets face it is there anything more memorable to witnesses than a big guy and a dwarf eating a meal dressed as women i mention the big guy and the dwarf because besides the old guy everyone else seems to blend into each other in fact they wear matching white jumpsuits throughout most of the movie the movie has very little character development in the first half and as a result the second half really lacks an emotional punch as we are often trying to figure out who is who in their individual payoff scenes  speaking of a drag the second half has all those wonderful sweeping camera shots and big emotional moments and great symbolism that makes a great film it is also excruciatingly slow which makes for a boring movie  9 souls is a big disappointment the reviews gush about a great film and its in there somewhere good luck finding it yourself,negative,0
hello mary lou prom night ii starts at the hamilton high school prom of 1957 where mary lou maloney lisa schrage is cheating on her date bill nordham steve atkinson with bud cooper robert lewis bill finds out  is devastated meanwhile mary lou is announced prom queen 1957  takes to the stage to accept her award bill still hurting decides to play a practical joke on mary lou so he throws a firecracker on stage but the still lit fuse catches mary lous dress setting it  her on fire within seconds mary lou is toast 30 years later  hamilton high is soon to hold its annual prom night bill micheal ironside is now the principal  has a teenage son named craig justin louis who is dating vicki carpenter wendy lyon  are both planning on going to the prom together bud richard monette is now a priest that terrible night 30 years ago still haunt both bill  bud one day vicki is looking around the schools basement when she discovers a large trunk which she opens this turns out to be a bad move as the vengeful spirit of mary lou is set free  is intent on claiming her crown as prom queen  in her spare time sets out to avenge her untimely death first up is jess browning beth gondek whose death is put down to a suicide mary lou begins to posses vickis body as the night of the prom draws nearer after disposing of some competition in the shape of kelly hennenlotter terri hawkes who tries to fix the prom so she wins mary lou in vickis body is crowned hamilton high prom queen which allows mary lou herself to come back from the dead to make an unexpected appearance  really liven the party up  with absolutely no connection to the original prom night 1980  directed by bruce pittman i thought hello mary lou prom night ii wasnt a particularly good film the script by ron oliver concentrates more on supernatural elements rather than cheap teen slasher themes whether this was a good or bad decision will depend on your expectations i suppose personally i found these different elements didnt really gel or work that well together at all the whole film was far to slow to be really enjoyable after the opening sequence where mary lou dies no one else is killed until the half hour mark  then the film plods along for another half an hour until vicki is finally possessed  the film finally picks up momentum for the climax where an evil mary lou kills a whole one person at the prom before she is supposedly defeated come on horror film fans you did expect that clichéd killer not dead  ready for a sequel ending didnt you dont expect a hight body count just five throughout the entire film  none particularly graphic although i did like the way monica beverley hendry as beverly hendry tried to hide in a shower room locker which mary lou crushed  resulting in poor monicas blood oozing out the supernatural side of hello mary lou prom night ii is depicted by vicki having lots of hallucinations for the first hour  mary lou controlling objects during the latter stages including a couple of creepy shots of a rocking horse which comes to life the blackboard scene is quite good as well as it turns into water  zombie hands drag vicki into it the slasher side of hello mary lou prom night ii isnt outstanding i did like mary lou herself as she churns out the obligatory oneliners  she made for a good villain even if she didnt get to kill enough people oh  yes i did get the running homages to various other horror film directors with almost all of the characters sharing last names with one this obviously adds nothing to the film but is a nice little touch i suppose the acting is ok but the normally dependable micheal ironside looks lost  uninterested almost as if hes asking himself what hes doing in this  if hell ever work again forget about any gore someone is hanged there is a stabbing with a crucifix that happens off screen someone is impaled with a neon light a computer goes crazy  electrocutes someones face  mary lou bursts out of vickis body at first as a rotting zombie which was quite a cool scene there are some full frontal nudity shots in the girls shower as well if thats your thing to give it some credit hello mary lou prom night ii is ok to watch has reasonable production values throughout  is generally well made overall i was disappointed by hello mary lou prom night ii it was just too slow  ultimately uneventful to maintain my interest for nearly 100 minutes im not sure whether it deserves a 3 or 4 star rating ill give it a 4 as theres nothing specifically wrong with it i suppose  ive sat through much worse films but it just didnt really do anything for me im afraid,negative,0
as a huge fan of the original i avoided this film like the plague when the bad reviews started coming in eight years ago but i just finished watching this film and found it to be a really pleasant surprise  okay if you are looking for a retread of the original youre in for a big disappointment but if you are looking for something quite different a bit edgy and political then this is the film for you   gregory is now thirty four and works as a teacher at his old comprehensive school where hes being pursued by a fellow teacher and having sexual dreams about one of his students when the student insists on meeting up with gregory a series of misadventures ensue that include torture breaking and entering and all manner of unexpected twists and turns that left me feeling elated and moved  if you are looking for something original then i highly recommend this film i only wish that more people had gone to see this when it was released and seen it for what it really is,positive,1
i respect alex cox the filmmaker i really do hes like the kid at school who you think at first is just trying a little too hard to be different a literary punkrocker who has dipped more than his feet into spaghetti westerns and science fiction and fringeculture and come out into the world ready to take s on but then you see what he can actually do the talent and raw feverish artistry and moments of true absurd hilarity capable of him and you are ready to see whatever he has to offer but theres two sides to his proverbial coin he can either really hit it out of the park repo man sid  nancy walker arguably or just try just a little too hard and pull way too many pretentious rabbits out of the hat straight to hell death and the compass falls into the latter category and while i respect its mostly original approach to tackling a detectivekiller story it too falls on its face and its weirdness becomes oddly dull  it has a strange enough setup and already irreverent style to follow a detective erik lonnrot is after a killer with a hellfire voice red something and it seems that the killer is leaving disturbing clues with his victims scrawled in blood on the walls are messages that according to eyewitness alonso zunz christopher eccleston looking as if he just walked off shallow grave without changing his look has religious significance in the kabbalah we follow lonnrot on his case and his methods of going after the perp which include following at first a triangular and then compassshaped pattern on the map this despite the protests of the flabbergasted commissioner treviranus miguel sandoval who also looks back in flashforwards sitting at a desk and speaking to the audience in garbled but sad descriptions of his former employee and colleague after the fact of the case  oh cox has his moments of creativity and interest such as a shot where we see the entire scope of the harrowing depths of the police station where ecclestons character is taken in by handcuffs for his own protection says lonnrot in case of getting lost in the wrong room and were followed in a long tracking shot maybe the best or just most curious where were taken through very dark hallways with very little direction lost in the maze of turns and oddities among the characters and its never something that isnt fascinating to look at with miguel garzons cinematography a morbid delight but the plot goes through hoolahoops to keep things so offbeat it might as well be beatless alltogether the performances save for a confident boyle and for eccleston at the very end are pretty bad especially sandoval who just seems to squirm in his seat reciting the goofy dialog given to him to speak at the audience  while the murder plot itself contains an intention for the audience that this isnt something weve seen before that its in a society with a good many rioters and architecture suggesting alphavilles next decrepit wave it too fizzles out very quickly whats the conflict here i was never that much engaged with boyles own personal mission to find this killer and only mildly caught up in the few flashes of deranged scenes of the killer andor killers going after people like in the building early on cox himself has an amusing cameo and just when i started to think it was leading up to something spectacular with boyle and eccleston in that big not as big as you think building in the south section of the city it suddenly gives us a twist that we know in the back of our minds is coming but hope isnt and it deflates any of the humdrum mystery its been leading up to for all of coxs uncanny touches as a filmmaker for all of his opposition to spoonfeeding the audience with a conventional approach which i do respect death and the compass ultimately cuts one off at the brainstem its masturbatory,negative,0
rendition is a film not to miss with solid writing from kelley sane and with the direction of gavin hood that takes us on a story which is a ride through a mans journey through hell once again meryl streep in a convincing role of the cia today and great performances from a cast of superlative actors in reese witherspoon jake gyllenhall and alan arkin along with actors of middle eastern descent who add to the reality of the story  in rendition you see how terrorism can breed terrorism and as the film progresses tying the story to what is playing out in the middle east is reality brought to the screen the external shots add to the intensity of the story and peter sarsgaard does a brilliant job of playing an assistant in the ass kissing way of how american politics are conducted too bad there has not been a larger audience for this film as along with the valley of elah and lions for lambs rendition plays an important role in showing an audience how the fight for and the protection of democracy can go seriously astray,positive,1
i love documentaries they are among my favorite genres of film before seeing this film i hadnt seen one that i hadnt liked  the premise for this film is a great one the execution is well done there were some times early on when i laughed and smiled yet as the film went on the more tedious and irritating it became this could have been something special had the subject not been such an inarticulate childish inept putz i appreciate his passion for film but quit your whining if youre short on funds maybe you shouldnt have so many kids or spend so much money on alcohol maybe you should have gone to film school or at least graduated from high school maybe you should have lived life and gotten perspective and experiences that could add to your vision   there are so many people out there with stories that are interesting funny and poignant to see this guy chosen over any of them is nothing less than crass if you want to do a documentary on a film maker why not do one on someone from china or iran a film maker with real problems   two final questions  who takes a little kid to see apocalypse now  how many times did this guy say man,negative,0

stupid horror film about five 20 somethings 3 guys 2 girls going to this place in the middle of nowhere what they dont know is dr chopper and his female assistants attack and kill anybody who ventures in their woods they use their body parts for some experimentsor something also five college girls and two lesbians are thrown in to be killed off and show some cleavage  pretty desperate the story is confusing and boring the gore is laughably fake dr chopper and his assistants overact terribly theres some dreadful black humor in here and people just stand around while their friends are being attacked or just stand there and let the people kill them  this was pretty insulting there are a few pluses a twist an hour in was pretty good and the five young actors are actually good chase hoyt is great as reese butch hansen is ok as jimmy ashley mccarthy is also good as tamara and robert adamson has his moments as nicholas best of all is chesley crisp as jessicashe was excellent some of the dramatic scenes between these five were wellacted and interesting unfortunately the dialogue wasnt really there for them im giving it a 4 for their performancesbut nothing else here is worth mentioning hopefully these actors will get roles worthy of them,negative,0
herbie the volkswagen that thinks like a man is back now being driven by maggie peyton lindsay lohan a young woman who hopes to become a nascar champion the only thing standing in her way is the current champion trip murphy matt dillon who will do anything to stop them  the original love bug wasnt that good even as a kid i remember not liking it very much i had some hope for the sequel though i mean the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it seem like a pretty fun movie unfortunately herbie is no better now than he was before the film is defiantly weak for people over the age of 12 it will probably entertain the kids but thats all  i realize its a kids film and all but they could have made the film a little more interesting there were very few laughs and it got boring near the end most of the actors seemed dead in their roles too lindsay lohan was alright as maggie peyton she usually gives better performances like in freaky friday and mean girls matt dillon gave the best performance out of everyone he was very good as the bad guy even though he didnt have a lot to work with justin long breckin meyer and michael keaton are really just there and they dont do anything special  angela robinson directs and she does an okay job she tries to keep the film interesting but shes working with a weak script thomas lennon and ben garant wrote the screenplay and would it be any surprise to you that they were also responsible for taxi and the pacifier these two make light films yet they fail to really make the stories interesting or enjoyable its not completely their fault but hopefully next time they will try harder in the end herbie is a safe predictable family film thats worth watching if youre a kid everyone else is better off skipping it rating 410,negative,0

may contain spoilers ok it wasnt exactly as good as expected in fact it was a lot different than i had thought it would be but it still turned out to be a pretty good movie  i usually dont care too much for that type of music but in this movie it worked perfectly i mean duh hes a rock star but anyway i loved stuart townsend in this and aaliyah although she had a small part in the movie was amazing  and even though tom cruise played lestat in the interview with a vampire i have to admit that i am glad he turned down the role even though i normally hate when they use different people to play the same characters in like sequels and stuff  overall the movie was great and i enjoyed watching it even if there were parts that could have been better great vampire movie,positive,1
mitchell leisens fifth feature as director and he shows his versatility by directing a musical after his previous movies were heavy dramas he also plays a cameo as the conductor  you can tell it is a pre code movie and nothing like it was made in the us for quite a while afterwards like 30 years leisen shot the musical numbers so they were like what the audience would see  no widescreen shots or from above ala busby berkeley what i do find funny or interesting is that you never actually see the audience  as others have mentioned the leads are fairly characterless and jack oakie and victor mclaghlan play their normal movie personas gertrude michael however provides a bit of spark  the musical numbers are interesting and some good the rape of the rhapsody in particular is amusing but the drama unconvincing and faked  three murders is too many and have minimal emotional impact on the characters this is where this movie could have been a lot better,positive,1
30 seconds into the opening credits i had this feeling that this was going to be a bad movie but i didnt know just how bad then the actor playing the evil nazi scientist opens his mouth and my friend and i decide that in order to survive this movie well have to turn the volume down make up our own dialogue and double the speed on the dvd but that didnt help about half way through we turned it off now ive lived through some very bad movies before both with and without the aide of mystery science theater 3000 and svengoolie but there are just some movies which i doubt even the bots can save the biggest part of the movie that bothered me the most was that the people hypnotized into believing theyre zombies had rotting green skin i guess they were all hypnotized into death then hypnotized into rotting themselves stick to the real bmovie cult classics like plan nine from outer space,negative,0
lucille ball was a mighty power in television throughout the 1950s and 1960s but she still made an occasional film most notably the long long trailer and the facts of life although her television career remained strong as the 1970s began her movie career seemed to be winding downbut ball was determined to have one last big screen fling and the project she selected was the 1966 musical mame  in many respects the role seemed tailormade based on the popular novel which gave rise to two different broadway plays mame dennis is a wacky wildly uninhibited woman who inherits her orphaned nephew patrickand leads him on a wild tour of lifes possibilities bouncing from one comic spree to another the music which featured such songs as open a new window and if he walked into my life today was among jerry hermans best work the supporting cast which included robert preston and bea arthur was the best of the best expectations were high opening night fanfare was tremendous the film was a disaster critics were aghast and audiences sat slackjawed  no matter what hardcore lucy fans may say mame is a fiasco so much so that it is hard to know where to start it is badly directed badly filmed badly performed and there lucille ball is at the center of it all unable to dance unable to sing and grinning like a waxworks dummy while incredibly bad choreography swirls around her but the disaster is hardly of her making alone the supporting cast fares no better bea arthur and jane connell recreate their stage roles of vera charles and agnes gooch the former is stagey the latter is dismal robert preston manages to sing with a smile but hes pretty much on his own and clearly none too happy about it  the dvd brings the film from the vhs panandscan release to widescreen but that only means theres more awfulness to see everybody loves lucy but only the least critical fan could love lucys mame while i wouldnt say its bad enough to make you want to gouge your eyes out you may wish you had not recommended  gft amazon reviewer,negative,0
for me reviewing movies is an extension of my love of filmand of horror cinema in particular the reviews ive written thus far have been for films that i love respect and admire and i have eagerly rewarded them with glowing accolades and perfectten ratings a lifelong horror movie fan it is a tremendous pleasure for me to be able to share with others my thoughts and ideas about great horror films and to hopefully have a hand in exposing people to movies they may not otherwise seek out i only recently began reviewing films for the imdb and it was my initial intention to concentrate only on my own personal favorites examining those which i believe are of substance and of lasting value to the horror genre however the existence of films like graduation day is without pun a thorn in my side completely devoid of any merit whatsoever this 1981 hodgepodge of unformed ideas is amateurishly directed poorly acted and in every sense an unmitigated embarrassment to horror cinema during the brief couple of years before and after this movies release we saw the appearance of domestic and canadian films such as halloween ii prom night terror train madman my bloody valentine the prowler just before dawn final exam and hell night among others these films though of varying degrees of quality clearly strove to achieve something in terms of story line plotting acting direction and overall tone not every movie released during this bountiful season of the slasher era would be of the artistic merit or commercial success of the original halloween or friday the 13th but these films were all wellmade and clearly contributed to the ongoing development of horror cinema graduation day an abysmal farce about a masked killer stalking members of a high school track team was directed by herb freed whom one can only hope will never again attempt to besmirch the horror genre with such a travesty the task of creating worthwhile horror films is best left to those who have a genuine love and respect for the genre this movie fails miserably on every possible level not the least of which are dreadfully wooden performances dimestore special effects an irritating musical score and most of all a story lacking even the slightest hint of tension or suspense a pointless exercise in how to waste film graduation day is an utter disgrace to horror cinema,negative,0
s epatha merkerson shines as nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of ruben santiago jr marcus franklin while growing up under the guardianship of nanny the film gives a good character study of both nanny and ruben and manages to capture lifes ups and downs in a realistic fashion unlike so many memoirs that are made into film the supporting cast adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including mos def macy gray terrence dashon howard rosie perez louis gossett jr liev schreiber jimmy smits ernie hudson delroy lindo and patricia wettig loses some steam and vibrancy towards the end and the ending sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling but overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by merkerson,positive,1
first of all it is interesting to note that one of the users here who commented on this film from belgium had to add that lumumba was communist if this user indeed watched the film the message was that he was not communist but pigeonholed by none other than belgium the us the un etc as a communist leader for other individuals corporations and countrys political and economic gains even if one decides to accept that the film partakes in revisionist history it would be naive to assume that lumumba was communist especially coming from the country which granted the congo independence and since lumumba was elected democratically to his seat as prime minister  onto the film  this is one of the most important and powerful films i have seen in quite some time depicting the struggles of the african freedom fighter and elected prime ministers struggles as its first leader mr peck does a quite commendable job of putting together all of the pieces into one work and this must have been quite some task due to the fact that most people outside of the congo and belgium likely do not know the history of lumumba and the congo outside of some light coverage of african imperialism hopefully in one of their high schoolsecondary school or maybe universitycollege level history classes he had his work cut out for him  and to to think that oliver stones jfk took over 3 hours lumumba runs under 2 hours and a most engaging 115 minutes it was as we find that his desire to not compromise with western powers whom he holds responsible for the atrocities to his people particularly belgium while trying to deal with power struggles within his own borders apparently even with some of his friends it is amazing that the man lived as long as he did  this is a must see for anyone interested in equality justice humanity history politics and true freedom you will not be disappointed,positive,1
what did producerdirector stanley kramer see in adam kennedys novel and kennedys very puzzling screenplay were there a few pieces left out on purpose and what about gene hackman richard widmark edward albert eli wallach and mickey rooney what did they see in this very muddled story  and why did candice bergen who gave a horrible performance accept such a thankless role  the domino principle wants to be on the same footing as the parallax view or the manchurian candidate and misses the mark by a very wide margin a major misfire by stanley kramer,negative,0

the dvd release of this movie hopes you will buy this movie on the name and face of sandra bullock her picture from years after this film basically is the cover art and the back cover art and the inside cover art the same picture her name is prominently shown on the front cover all 4 edges and the disk itself she is the first name in the list of stars her biography is printed inside the case this film must revolve around her character right wrong it is her first movie and she plays a minor role after watching the movie every role seems like a minor role the character dog actually displays some personality less than an hour after watching it i dont even remember the names of many characters  maybe if i watched it several more times i could actually figure out the plot but i dont think it would be worth the effort  oh wait i just remembered a funny bit shootemup video game fans will get a kick out of the doomcam looks just like a firstperson shooter game hands and gun pointing out in front of the camera  i am generally not a person to be critical of movies but this may be the worst movie i have ever seen i kept expecting some silhouettes to walk across the screen sit down and start making fun of it  im just glad that the money we spent on this used went to charity,negative,0
ok i would not normally watch a farrelly brothers movie i cant recall ever watching one i also dont recall watching a jimmy fallon movie alright i did watch taxi but i said penance and was forgiven for that mistake but this movie had drew barrymore and i just think she is the cutest thing i dont know what it is about her but i just smile the whole time i am watch her she just captivates me that way i mean i even watched adam sandler just to see her in 50 first dates how sad is that this wasnt the greatest baseball movie  it wasnt supposed to be it was a love story about a sad puppy that hung on to the only thing that never let him down until he found something worth giving that up for it had a predictable ending but there was so much on the way there that made it worthwhile,positive,1

while watching this movie you notice right away the cheesy elements of a standard tv movie though through out the picture the plot changes if you are bold enough to say this movie has a plot are by the book and unoriginal and with every one the movie kept getting worse  candace cameron bure famous for her role as dj tanner on the hit tv show full house is not very convincing as a possessed twenty something trying to avenge the possesers death i believe she is fine actress just not in the thriller range  the filming was trashy and like i said the plot stale though watching it i knew i was in for automatic cheese i had no idea how much worse this film could get  i highly do not recommend this movie unless cheep filmaking and poor writing is what you looking for,negative,0
this movie is the worst ever sorry but this was a total waste of good hours quasipsychology and bactors makes a baaaad horror movie you can say that if you are into bad movies you will adore this one and the hot chick wasnt all that hot there is absolutely no climax to the movie and the worst part is the ending song some homemade thing with these words its in awful condition the world is a mess when heads fall of bodies and girls wont stay dressed the cops they are clueless eating donuts in their car newspaperflash next morning headless bodytopless bar jesus sorry guys but milks gone bad with this one,negative,0
what can i say after i say the one line summary sandra does a credible job but what with the bad direction and story line it cant save it way too much pre occupation with guns how can the hollywood types rant about the need for gun control in our society and spend so much time and film footage focused on guns its just worse than expected,negative,0
if you just watched all dogs go to heaven and learn that theres a sequel dont watch it its horrible its absolutely awful they rush the characters to develop sasha for example begins singing about how you can count her out for love and at the end this seems more like a dramatic romance flick than a comedyadventure film they rip charlie out of his character and replace him with a gushy soft but still rebellious version of himself  the humor behind carfaces character is just completely lost hes a totally different dog he doesnt have a cool voice anymore he isnt that villain you love to hate anymore hes just a wimp voiced by none other than mermaid man from spongebob speaking of voice actors  charlie has a completely different voice and while it isnt horrible i dont like it its terrible in comparison to the excellent job that burt reynolds did for the character in the first film dom deluise is wonderful as always as itchy that character stays true and thats why this film gets a 310 purely because dom deluise was still voicing itchy  oh and my last complaint i know annmaries movie was done and gone she has parents now etc but did charlie completely forget about her or what no mention at all of her in the second film i mean even a small mention from itchy would have been acceptable ex charlie we have to get back you cant take care of every kid that needs rescuing or something of the sort i mean he died living with her she deserves some kind of mention  dont watch this if youre looking for a wonderful sequel,negative,0

probably because this is columbias first film in color the colors look different specially in the indoor scenes they seem to be stronger sharper and the result is a bit unrealistic but very pleasing randolph scott is the sheriff a good guy but the real star of the movie is a very young glenn ford who is an outlaw that wants to change evelyn keyes is the woman that starts falling for ford and claire trevor is the countess that runs the saloon there is a funny character called nitro that does not think twice before blowing it i particularly enjoyed two moments of the film one when there is a tremendous horse stampede and you see thousands of horses there was no computer to help at that time so i presume they must have gathered all those horses no easy task another moment is the final shootout technically very good there is also quite a fistfight seeing this western made in 1943 with such great action scenes makes you come to a sad conclusion they dont make them anymore would they be able to in case they wanted i have my doubts,positive,1
a bit slow and boring the tale of an old man and his wife living a delapidated building and interacting with a fixed cast of characters like the mailman the brothers sitting on the porch the wealthy cigar smoking man the photography of the river is marvelous as is the interior period decoration if you like decoration of banana republic stores this is a must,positive,1
this is one of those movies that you happen across when youre channel surfing on a saturday afternoon and you get drawn into it and end up watching the whole thing i thought that it was well acted and it really made me feel for the characters though its a bit slow moving focusing more on the relationships between bonnie and clyde and their family members it never got boring we dont really see too much of all the robberies that they were so legendary for and instead most of the shootouts take place when theyre ambushed by the police i thought tracey needham who played bonnie really did a good job with her character going from a nice country girl to a coldblooded killer is a challenging thing to portray and i enjoyed the subtlety she brought to the role  overall an above average effort especially considering it was a made for tv movie,positive,1
loulou delights in the same way an expensive high quality french wine does it leaves you with a very fine aftertaste  loulous theme isnt new the film doesnt carry an original plot either its colored picturing shows fine but not extraordinary its setting is serious its elegant styling never and nowhere puts any weight on your mind  whatever one further may say about loulou its beyond doubt that this very french film stands out for its excellent acting the three leads convincingly reflect all numerous doubts and tenses sparkling between them making the plot alive their acting fully invites you to participate to make friends  for those around at the time loulou also provides an extra bonus its perfectly captured mood of 1980,positive,1
i like it because of my recent personal experience especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite the characters in the firm did not really enjoy their real lives but they did enjoy themselves ie what they were the movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory a good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful european city but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those before sunrise dealt with it in a nice way which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film before sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head it just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities this made the conversations between the characters interesting not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas you would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story the end was not quite important after all you could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie movies are supposed to be enjoyable this is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it i am on a journey too the movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions,positive,1
thank you the filmzone for showing this sleazy soft core sex flick at 1 am i truly enjoyed it to be honest i expected a lot more from a sexy cast with mckayla dru berrymore and of course the talented chloe nicholle as rebecca carter  the production values are truly bad mainly because of the low budget but a little more effort wouldnt harm for example the cinematography makes it look like a hard core porno movie theres absolutely no effort in lightning but lets ignore that fact because lets be honest we watched pleasures of sin because of the high amounts of sex  the sex factor is pretty good and offers steamy explicit scenes chole nicholle delivers the best performance of the female cast  so my advice is  watch this movie if you are in the mood for good explicit sex or just watch it if you are a fan of mrs nicholle  recommended only for the sex scenes dont expect anything else,positive,1

im a black man living in a predominantly black city that being said i have some major misgivings about tyler perrys work i realize that some people out there feel the need to praise him because hes black and trying to portray a positive image about the culture but i honestly do believe that were perry white this film would have had the naacp al sharpton and jessie jackson all over his ass  i have been forced to watch this movie one whole hell of a lot recently and each repeated viewing makes my blood boil the characters are poorly written and acted the jokes are so bad i have to actually be told something is supposed to be funny im just going to break this big pile of sht down  madeasuck the character may have had some appeal but it doesnt anymore when the only thing she ever seems to do is smack around children and threaten adults with violence she is less than useless she is unnecessary  the situation with the wife beating fiancé was horsesht if a woman was so scared to death of her husband why would she try to run away when hes sleeping in bed wouldnt it have made more sense for her to leave when he was at work at any rate the characters in this arc were so annoying and overbearing that i hoped he would throw her off the balcony and was royally ticked when he didnt  then there are the two lovebirds a bus driver asks a woman out by harassing her while hes making his rounds i couldnt believe it i really couldnt believe when she agreed to go out with him even more but what takes the cake is that a grown man was reduced to tossing pebbles at a window and passing notes like a ten year old by a castrating mega bitch i dont use this term lightly but that woman only had two modes morose victim and psycho momma no matter which of these two faces she showed however there was one constant the bus driver wasnt going to get any he even married her without sampling the goodswtf   then theres the family reunion scene here weve got the mother load which includes implied incestual taboos grinding for the sake of grinding shirtless overly musclebound bball plus the great taste of maya angelou when those babes dragged their butts outside and called a meeting was i wrong to wish that the oldest of them was claimed by a heart attack all this crap is going on at the reunion in laughably easy to separate groups and then they ring a bell when they do everyone drops what theyre doing and heads on over for a stern talking too just like a pack of pavlovs doggieswtf   then you have the final five minutes of the film in it we see the abusive fiancé get manhandled by his longtime victim and all around bad actress there is an impromptu wedding where black people are dressed like angels and are hanging from the ceilingwtf the only reason to watch it this far besides testing your threshold for pain is the hope that the second villain of this story gets her ass handed to her as well guess what it doesnt happen instead perry takes the testicularly challenged way out and plays it safe ending the movie on a tone of forgivenesswtf   im pretty sure that if given a day  i could probably write a doctoral dissertation on all the ways this movie sucks dont even get me started on the rest of tyler perrys films im just going to say this in my opinion as a black guy dw griffiths legacy lives on the irony is that it is doing so through a black man who will be praised for doing what birth of a nation did selling us down the river i only wish perrys films were dudes so i could kick them in the nuts thanks a lot dude what are you going to follow this up with in 2009 a comedy about the raping and savage beating of slaves in colonial america,negative,0
this film really used its locations well with some amazing shots dark and disturbing the film moves very slowly but constantly keeps you watching modern love worked well in the gold coast film fantastic program this year offering audiences a glimpse at an australian cinema that is usually neglected most importantly it is refreshing to see australian cinema not taking on the cliché aussie characters and story lines we have seen done to death over the years this film would compliment any festival and will open debate after its screenings the performances and characters are well developed and the cinematography is fantastic an interesting exploration into family relationships and environments,positive,1
okay  the title house of frankenstein was a reference to a line from the original frankenstein movie when they follow it up with a movie entitled house of dracula which makes no real sense you know that its just beginning to turn into a franchise  without explanation dracula is back and hes calling himself baron latos he infiltrates the home of a doctor edelmann with the claim that he is seeking a cure for his vampirism edelmann has a hunchback nurse who assists him what is it with hunchback assistants in these movies but what dracula is really interested in is his other more beautiful assistant at this point larry wolf man talbot returns again no explanation given and just happens to be seeking the same doctor for a cure to his lycanthropy and then he just happens to fall into a cave in which plants can be grown to help him which also just so happens to contain the frankenstein monster dear god when will it end  sure the other universal monster sequels were silly but this is just ridiculous  first the good stuff there are some great settings and the vampire bat effects are slightly better than usual some of the other effects are pretty neat too john carradine isnt bad as dracula once you get used to him but still nothing like as brilliant as lugosi was in my opinion onslow stevens plays a much better vampire in this movie although he has exactly the opposite problem to carradine  all of the creepiness and none of the class none of the performances are that great but its more due to the atrocious script than anything else  the female parts are particularly badly written but stupid as it is it remains reasonably entertaining for the most part the best thing about it is its short length  now the bad stuff  its not creepy its poorly written and it doesnt work i was hoping the three monsters would begin some kind of a supernatural struggle for power but it doesnt happen the focus is almost entirely on dracula who isnt particularly well portrayed on the other hand this is the only movie in which dracula infects another man but it is done via a blood transfusion rather than a bite as universal were always uncomfortable with the possible homosexual subtext larry talbot is decent as always as the wolf man but he plays a comparatively small part once again the part of frankensteins monster is reduced to the anticlimatic closing moments for gods sake glenn strange was fantastic as the creature why not give him more screen time its unfortunate that the series had to end on this note not counting the classic comedy abbott  costello meet frankenstein in the end it just fizzled in the sunlight and died much like dracula himself,negative,0
it must say something about the state of our nation that this programme is one of the most popular currently screened   the square is peopled by such a miserable untrustworthy amoral spiteful unrelentingly dour group of characters as can be imagined everyone is stabbing someone in the back everyone is attempting to commit adultery everyone is trying to cheat someone that or they are being stabbed cuckolded or swindled nobody is cheerful nobody laughs nobody has a blinding stroke of luck or a really nice day its hell with cockney accents  i suspect this programme must be sponsored by the samaritans its perfect viewing for the depressed it doesnt cheer them up what it does do is present a whole community of such terminally despondent sadarses that viewers are moved to believe their lot really could be worse  they might be living in albert square  apart from the above as a representation of londons east end it is pure hokum the programmemakers have evidently never been across town the first thing you encounter on the mile end road is a colossal mosque and this prettywell defines the racial majority of the population white british londoners are a dispersed and rapidly diminishing minority a large advertisement hoarding presently near the bow road flyover and sponsored by tower hamlets health care boasts that eight out of ten members of the community can now see their doctor more quickly ten healthy smiling faces beam down at the observer in confirmation eight of them are darkskinned   whats more i used to work with a bunch of anglosaxon  dare i say pukka  cockneys a few years ago and i can tell you that a more obnoxiously racist experience ive never had each day was like an oswald moseley rally they couldnt pass 5 minutes without denigrating some other race or nationality than their own and in terms that were repulsive and obscene fackin pakis and fackin maceroons were the small change of conversation in fact their entire and extremely limited stock of adjectives fixated upon sexorgans and their application alf garnett was a paragon of liberal virtue in comparison  any programme that purported to represent londons native eastend caucasians in their true nature would be completely unfit for broadcast  even after the 9 oclock watershed imagine a ku klux klan script written by quentin tarantino and youd be somewhere near the mark but when they werent being inveterate bigots they were at least extremely cheerful  i dont know how such a soapopera came to be this imaginary castaway island of white misery has absolutely no bearing upon real culture whatsoever and if youre of a comparatively sanguine disposition it will quickly reduce you to tears of grief comparatively ordinary actors pretending to be comparatively ordinary chronicdepressives with cockney accents  whats the point of that  dull dreary unrelentingly disillusional and ethnically preposterous the most popular programme of an apparently diseased and dying nation  avoid it like the plague,negative,0
i saw this movie by luck just because i was going through a phase where i had a new found admiration for bill pullman and wanted to see all of his recent movies and thank god i did this movie has stuck with me ever since and remain one of my favorites the story revolves around two girls who embark on a dramatic journey in a foreign country where theyll learn the true meaning of freedom  alice and darlene were just trying to spend a vacation together before going to college but their trip ended up a much more complicated story the struggle they go through as they are arrested in thailand and became prisoners is very moving and intense the acting is amazing the images extraordinary the soundtrack is fantastic and so right for the movie and the message transmitted definitely powerful i actually cant even find the right words to describe how this movie makes me feel every time i watch it i know some people havent appreciated as much as me by the rating the movie has but i swear this one you have to see i promise it will stick with you,positive,1
we had starz free weekend and i switched on the station to see what was on  it was this movie howling ii the acting was terrible but the eye candy was great sybil danning and marsha brown as the afore mentioned eye candy i was laughing a lot from the few scenes i saw  my friends wonder why i never want to go to horror movies  if they saw this film they would know why i would get thrown out for laughing so hard  just a couple of trivia notes  reb brown who played ben white had played captain american in a made for tv movie marsha brown was mick jaggers inspiration for the song brown sugar mick has great taste in women for sure,negative,0
for the life of me i can not understand the blind hype and devotion to this totally unbelievable movieand i think i have the qualifications to say so i am a former special operations soldier with 14 years in the lifestyle  this movie was totally totally unreal and obviously written by someone that did very little research into life in the army in combat or at a team or platoon level  three eod guys trouncing around bagdad on their own get real no chain of command get real eod clearing buildings get realeod military intelligence  sniper qualified buck sergeant get real wait i shot and killed a bad guy and then let two guys take me without firing another shot or being injured at all get reali carjack an iraqi civilian while i am only armed with a 9 mil break into another civilians house get punked by his wife then make it back to camp on foot in the middle of bagdad at night without as so much as a scratch or confrontation get real  there is absolutely no adherence to military protocol army and no resemblance at all to any army unit that i have even encountered totally unbelievable and disrespectful to the men and women of eod who contrary to this poor film are not wild adrenaline seeking yahoos but extremely qualified professionals doing an incredibly hard job,negative,0
the story of ed gein is interesting very interesting this movie however interesting only in the fact that it was actually made kane hodders portrayal of ed gein is so far off its not even the slightest bit funny ed gein did not behave psychotic in public he was very calm and collected and always extremely polite to everybody and talked to anybody who would listen this is one of the major things this movie failed to show the audience but the biggest mistake of this movie side from even one frame ever being shot was that ed never killed anyone without having been told to do so by his dead mother whom he thought was speaking to him from beyond the grave he killed only the people who his dead mother said he had to because it was gods will and he was very remorseful about it though that didnt stop him from experimenting with cannibalism and wearing peoples flesh i officially gave this movie a rating of 1 simply because 0 wasnt given to me as an option  i highly advise all to stay clear of this movie if you want to see a movie that accurately depicts ed gein and doesnt try to put in a subplot love story between a cop and a fictional woman who never existed i highly advise you see the original movie which unfortunately seems to not be on imdbcom though i could be wrong but i have yet to find it here the original doesnt stray from the actual events and doesnt try to twist the story i can understand telling the story from a different perspective but this movie just tried to straight change the true story itself something that i find as horrible as if someone made a movie based on 911 but gave it a twist that canada was behind it or a wwii movie saying hitler was a good guy and helped fight the nazis,negative,0
this is what happens when youre living in china and the local video store is running thin on englishlanguage titlesyou are blessed with this work of what appears to be yes romanian cinema nevertheless i think that it has real comedic potential  spoilers technically follow  though i dont think that it would in fact spoil anyones viewing pleasure to ask why a film set in a casino has a scene of beach archery even in flashback that mystery and many other conundrums remain to be exploited by desperate comedians perhaps when theyre stuck in bucharest  let me also wonder aloud why perfectly goodlooking people allow themselves to abuse themselves on film like this its sad,negative,0
what can i say about this band i was hooked in 68 i was a ten year old kid i grew up on the blues though my dad then these guys from the midlands came along a fusion of country rock heavy rock and blues i wish i could have got to see them live in the early years i was lucky enough to be there in 79knebworth that was the best concert ive seen to date i hope a full version of that hot august night will be realest soon this cd gave me a chance to see the boys over and over again the song remains the same is great but this cd gets down to the nitty gritty  long live the zepp,positive,1
film follows a bunch of students in the nyc high school of the performing arts theres coco irene cara a black singer who will make it to the top despite everything shes helped by bruno lee curren a white musician then theres doris maureen teefy who wants to be an actressbut shes shy and scared she becomes friends with motgomery paul mccranepurportedly the only gay student in the school and is romanced by raul barry miller then theres leroy gene anthony raywho sadly died in 2003 whos homeless and a great dancerbut cant read then theres various teachers albert hague anne meara stand out trying to teach the kids  the songs are great the title tune and out here on my own were nominated for best songfame won the dances are energetic and the young cast shows plenty of ambition and talent but this film misses the boat in the drama department many plot lines are brought up and completely left openended by the end of the movie why did coco do a porno did doris and raul remain together afterwords did either make it how about montgomerywhat happened to him and did leroy ever graduateand how there are too many long speeches raul has two and moments that just lead to nothing im assuming there were cuts in the scripti cant believe the movie just left all this open   still its worth seeing for the acting and again the music theres basically not one bad song and the dances go full force and at one point stop trafficliterally my favorites are fame out here and i sing the body electric which is a great closing song so i recommend it but can only give it a 7the script really needed to tie up loose endsand it didnt  trivia they wanted to shot this film at the actual school for performing arts but couldnt get permission the dean of the school read the script and said there was way too much swearing in the film that is truethere is a lot of foul language but thats how high school kids talk avoid the tv version which abysmally overdubs it,positive,1
this movie is very similar to death warrant with jeanclaude van damme and also has some similarities to island of fire with jackie chan and i also heard that there is some other very similar action movies but this film has a much better action than death warrant or even island of fire thats right the jackie chans movie rarely american action movies has such a great action sequences though there was many negative reviews on this film it easily beats most of the action movies of that time who were more successful there were many martial arts scenes david bradley was fast as bruce lee in this film and what else was good that fighting scenes were much longer than in most of the american martial arts movies the shootout scenes were similar with john woos movies maybe not that good but still very exiting there was also many impressive explosions and one great chase scene ive seen some other david bradleys movies but this one yet is the best in terms of action ok this movie has some cheesy moments but which movie hasnt the acting was decent charles napier was incredible and his character was real tough adam clark who played squid and yuji okumoto who played the main bad guy were also very good other actors acted pretty well too though the acting isnt important in this type of movies if you are action movies fan i mean the real action movies fan who really can appreciate the good action than you must see this film,positive,1
i couldnt relate to this film im surprised that people are lauding it for being so realistic how many people at your school were victim to incest how many closet homosexual jocks were there how many quiet people that you never noticed committed suicide hmmm ok you wouldnt know even if their were but really these are explosive problems which many us never deal with and yet there are so many teenagers with subtle problems which could have been explored but hey wheres the entertainment in that  with regards to the girl who committed suicide  i found this to be exploitative i actually think many people in high school at some stage feel invisible ignored and unwanted but what possesses someone to violently commit suicide on just another day of being ignored and unnoticed the filmmaker decided this girl would suicide to make the film more provocative and the graphic nature of the suicide to make it even more provocative i didnt buy it as a real life scenario  and the problems of the other students i didnt fully relate to bullying is explored but thats been done to death we all know it goes on and it truly is a matter of resolve within that person closet homosexuality pfft another cliché gets rolled out thats the thing really too many clichés i guessed the ending at the start there was a predictable unpredictability if that makes sense youve got all these characters with explosive problems and one with apparently none and i thought what is the point of this character unless shes the unsuspecting suicide victim and surely enough  one thing i will say and it is the saving grace of the film is that it does not glamourise suicide the suicide is very graphic and heartbreaking to watch it is a powerful scene regardless of how contrived it isand one that dismisses suicide as the easy option but the film is really not very imaginative and used stereotypes  not bad but certainly not groundbreaking or worthy of a 17minute standing ovation at cannes,negative,0
one of the worst movies ive ever seen with robert de niro the fan is a pointless cliché of an exercise in slasher flicks it tries to spin or twist the genre with preposterous plot lines of a a crazed fan turned psychotic  the movie meanders into nothing spoiler were to believe that a knifewielding idiot has access to and murders a baseball player in a lavish hotel with no witness security or cameras the movie is nonsense trying to tug at our heartstrings through the hoopla of baseball ending up mockingly unsophisticated and gimmicky not sure what all the actors were thinking when they got onboard this razzie this is as big a dud as they come stay far away if you prefer thought in your movies,negative,0
very few chess movies have been made over the last couple of years but this one is more than just a chess movie its a story about the need to be loved and the need to win itjohn toturro plays a psychologically challenged man nothing matters to him accept 64 squares and 32 pieces the game validates him as a person when he looses a game he looses the one thing that makes sense to him and john torturro expresses this in a beautiful fashioneven the love of a woman was not enough to save him from his sad existenceit makes you wonder if there other luzons out there who obsess about the gamei am sure they areif you are a chess enthusiast it wont hurt to watch itits an intelligent piece of work laid out properly and executed wellit achieves its objectivesunfortunately i doubt if there will be sequel,positive,1
i classify this as the worst movie of all time  if there ever was a movie i would wish upon my enemies this would be it the plot is ridiculous there are only 2 characters and the coincidences between these characters just completely strain belief  these factors combined to make this an extremely boring movie  my wife and mother walked out on the movie about 15 minutes in i figured that a movie this boring and slow must have some cool interesting plot twist and a was quite disappointed when nothing exciting materialized  i briefly considered sending the filmmakers a bill for my 2 hours of lost life,negative,0
this film was made and cast from my home town i remember the fuss about it and the whole hullabaloo about the fact molly ringwald was in town  storyline  essentially 20 years after a film was laid to rest without being finished a group of film students set out to complete it  with dire consequences it would seem someone does not want the film completed  the storyline is flimsy one has to remember that this is a comedy and therefore has to be taken a little tounge in cheek but it had no real oomph the characters are mostly transperant and the little info that you recieve about them you just dont care about it seems irrelevant it is weird hearing kylies accent as australian again and nice to see a kid i went to school with in a starring role but that doesnt redeem the film at all goodness knows why the makers thought they would get in molly ringwald perhaps due to the nature of the film it sort of pays homage to 80s films  bad horror filmsbut really an aussie actor would have done just fine  as far as casting is concerned a lot of the acting seemed constipated some of these kids especially the two main chics  they played director and producer looked like they were trying to act that is never a good look also the shots had a rough feel about them over lit perhaps just not as smooth as one is used to  the killer lord could it be less frightening there are some shock factors though and a couple of gross scenes i did like the film but it was not great it went for 90 minutes but could have gone for less perhaps if they had tightened the script it would have been better they had a lot of characters get killed  but no real build up to them getting slayed maybe if they had killed less people and actually concentrated on a scary atmosphere it would have been better  now i know it is a comedy and elements were funny or so unbelieveable they were funny but i am not convinced  lm,negative,0
im afraid i did not like this adaptation when i started watching it i had a strange feeling of watching some 70s tv series due to the filter and the musical score i did not like the end scene mr tilney appears dressed only in his waistcoat jane austen would never have a gentleman ride out without a frock coat looks like the producers made a modern misinterpretation of a romantic girls dream i appreciate the more modern ja adaptations much more that show an eye for these details that makes the bbc series so worthwhile sorry looking forward to the 2007 adaptation i hope that will be better and will show the benefits of 20 years of jane austen adaptations,negative,0
seeing gary busey in a g rated film was a first and a nice one at that i dont know much about the director but he obviously knows how to spend a few dollars and get the most out of them where did jillian clare come from my kids love her the only thing i remember christopher atkins doing was blue lagoon disney needs to see this film and put him to work the wife thinks he is very cute i liked what he did with his character he seemed so real what we liked most was the message this film sends out greed sucks and faith love and family wins this is the first lowbudget dvd weve bought that had so much stuff on it the producers made this one for kids and the kids loved it they liked the music and all the extras on the dvd the director probably wont stick to family movies but i hope he does  cause he really knows how to get the most out of kids animals and stars like gary busey the dog was great and seeing gary busey act like a dog was even funnier there wasnt much we didnt like about this one it hard to find a family film without all the crude humor and quigley was a delightful surprise,positive,1
this film is more than the story of danton it was a joint polish french production filmed at the time of the beginning of the end of the soviet system it probably helped spur the solidarity movements union activity it is more about poland in the 20th century than the french revolution solidarity began the end of the system this film itself is historical by its very existencethe rest is history  robspiere aka totalitarian leaders danton aka walensa when one watches this film one must remember the snowball which began in poland   actually it could be useful for seeing the superpower struggle within the only superpower left,positive,1
as a note id like to say that i saw this movie at my annual church camp where the entire youth group laughed at it i bought it when i saw it on a shelf one year later if only for the humor i derived from a bad attempt at making an evangelical movie  lay it down falls short of many movie fans expectations on several different planes most of the problems lie within the impersonal acting regardless of the nice cars in the film or the truth in christs sacrifice for you as a movie and witnessing tool lay it down hardly delivers   most good opinions of the movies are supported by christians agreeing with the message while its easy for a christian to agree with the points delivered the audience hardly ever witnesses life outside a cliché the fighting scene between ben and his brother is horribly dubbed and there are at least three blatant typos in the subtitles  i encourage anyone to watch the movie a second time with the directors commentary on it really helps you understand just why the movie was written how it was the directors views on secular society are practically opposite of what would cater to a moviegoers needs he shows a pedantic understanding of nonchristians as well as some points of religious conflict most of the editing he admits was rushed but satisfactory he thought the overused transitions and themes to be effective and was completely happy with the acting   he also inserted motifs that he was rather proud of all read most of the names are significant ben destin  been destined gus pelman  gospel man nicky d  nicodemus the car doing donuts is symbolic of the circling nothingness that is a life without christ when ben leaves on petes motorcycle he crosses his crutches to form a cross  im not making any of those up he throws around things like this in between saying while street racers and the like blow their brains out with guns and how god is in control when your born and when your die yes that was not a typo he really says that  i have little forgiveness reserved for this movie the cool cars and good message dont do jack to make this movie good however the movie was made from a group of unprofessional individuals on a budget less than 1100th of the fast and the furiouss and the time limit was unforgiving with that in mind i give it a score of 210 instead of the 110 i so dearly think it deserves,negative,0
chris rock apparently desperate for a cozy starvehicle which would cross his appeal over to white and mainstream black audiences updates the hit 1978 comedy heaven can wait with an urban agenda he plays a struggling comedian involved in a car accident who has his soul removed too soon from his bodyconsequently his angels must find another body to place him in and can only come up with that of a white businessman rewriting a movie as bland and sentimental as heaven can wait only shows that rocks eye was on the boxoffice this was strictly a corporate move organized by the most mercenary of hollywood players why not strive for something loftier or more memorable than a silly reincarnation comedy that culminates with an evening at the apollo terrific supporting cast including the usuallyreliable regina king the wonderful mark addy wanda sykes eugene levy and terrific frankie faison do what they can but rock seems awkward and unsure of himself throughout 12 from ,negative,0
de vierde man the fourth man 1984 is considered one of the best european pycho thrillers of the eighties this last work of dutch director paul verhoeven in his home country before he moved to hollywood to become a big star with movies like total recall basic instinct and starship troopers is about a psychopathic and disillusioned author jeroen krabbe going to the seaside for recovering there he meets a mysterious femme fatale renee soultendieck and starts a fatal love affair with her he becomes addicted to her with heart and soul and finds out that her three previous husbands all died with mysterious circumstances  de vierde man is much influenced by the old hollywood film noire and the psycho thrillers of alfred hitchcock and orson wells it takes much time to create a dark and gripping atmosphere and a few moments of extreme graphic violence have the right impact to push the story straight forward the suspense is sometimes nearly unbearable and sometimes reminds of the works of italian cult director dario argento  the cast is also outstanding especially krabbes performance as mentally disturbed writer that opened the doors for his international film career the living daylights the fugitive if you get the occasion to watch this brilliant psycho thriller on tv video or dvd dont miss it,positive,1
i cant believe anyone liked this movie ive seen a lot of lowbudget indie films but this one absolutely sucked low budget doesnt mean the movie has to be demented horror doesnt mean the movie has to be demented there was nothing scary about this movie at all it was just a gorefest and a particularly disturbing one at that the acting was average considering they were all unheard of actors but the story was pathetic the dialog was pathetic the movie tries to come off as artistic or something this is not one of those really great indie films that cost only thousands of dollars to make but are incredibly well done this was nothing more than an excuse for some extremely sick people to put their perverse obsessions on film other reviews here also said that the soundtrack suckedthats because most of it was written by the same person and some of the songs were written by one of the writers of the movie there were no redeeming qualities to this movie at all a complete waste of my time and money,negative,0
first of all this was not a three hour movie  two hours ten minutes last time i checked commercials arent actually part of a movie perhaps though it shouldve been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours yeah would have gotten more in been able to explore some more emotion overall though it was an interesting look into the lives of lucy and desi i watch i love lucy from time to time and love it but never have i read or seen a biography never knew anything about their lives off the screen because of this movie i do now but im not so sure thats a good thing everything here no one really needed to know this was essentially a movie that didnt need to be made but it was made and the reason is because lucy  desi are still such huge stars and certain people in american society feel that the rest of society needs to know all about our tv and movie stars that is definitely so not true and very very sad  anyway what was shown here in lucy was pretty good two complaints  the actress who played viv vance  not great casting at all and the switch from madeline zima to rachel york uhhh like lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden shes a whole new person that wasnt too great but the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between lucy  desi no the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasnt necessarily a drawback to this movie because like i said this focused mainly just on lucy  desi had there been more time had the story been more about lucys entire life then maybe the kids woulda been there more but they werent so we got to see the likes of gable  lombard red skelton and buster keaton very briefly instead wow that was one thing about this story that i thought was really cool his presence and influence in lucys life really neat and its too bad that wasnt explored more oh well what was explored was done well for the most part honestly i dont think ill ever watch this again and i dont think this moviell be that memorable for someone who digs i love lucy but isnt an enormous lucille ball fan this should be an interesting watch my grade for this b,positive,1
im not a follower of a certain movie genre i classify movies only as industrial or nonindustrial valentine is the second industrial movie of the director jamie blanks after his urban legends unlike urban legends the screenplay and the story line is very weak yet again unlike urban legends the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic and that is what makes valentine the best   as the first basic and iconic element the growing hatred of the serial killer is so downtoearth since his secondary school years he has grown up with his wounds he had accumulated in his soul against his classmate girlfriends who have made fun of him when you concentrate enough on this first element while watching the movie you will come to see this point of view of humanism noone is entirely good or evil in fact somebody known as evil can be secretly kind hearted just because the story line and the direction is very weak we are not as satisfied as we deserved   the second iconic element is of course the magnificent togetherness of the late 90s super starlets my favourite is jessica cauffiel who is killed within the coolest way to be killed an arrow shot from a bow broaches her tummy and stays stuck in while she was playing hideandseek with her blind date never able to met with katherine heigl is the first starlet getting killed in a biology laboratory while trying to hide under human body models lying on the surgical operation tables denise richards is killed third while she just found a valentines day gift for her at a whirlpool bath jessica capshaw is killed last in a confidential and unseen way then she is calumniated to be as the serial killer marley shelton is the unluckiest one with a vicissitude of fortune that she is going to be killed within the most confidential way that we will never know cause the movie is coming to an end before she is getting killed finally benita ha is the luckiest one since she was not a classmate of the serial killer david boreanaz  the third and the last iconic element is the soundtrack from the blind date labyrinth scene the valentines day celebration at dorothys house scenes and ultimately the killing themes everybody has loved the soundtrack as far as i know hard rock never suits better within a serial killermystery movie,positive,1
a bunch of medical student yuppies get together in their spare time to hook each other to the electrical cables and die then they stand around counting the time before brain death and then start cpr and heartmassage and bring each other back to life the fact that julia roberts was in this movie should say it all flatliners is like group ghost everyone wants to see their dead relatives and visit their old dead buddies so what better way to do it than have a bunch of medical students kill you for five minutes and then bring you back to life the rest of the movie has the predictable relationship issues plus the predictable gee maybe if we keep killing each other one of these days one of us will stay dead doh this movie should have been called brain dead the fact that the characters were depicted as being medical students made me wonder if they had gone to a foreign correspondence school to get their degrees the only thing that kept this film from being a total laugh was that they did not just stick their fingers into electrical outlets in order to die this film would have been a great three stooges comedy movie,negative,0
this is probably the worst excuse for television programming since oh i dont know whats happening now nothing ever happened on this ridiculous series even though its mostly shot by britney and kevin themselves you dont get any good details into their personal lives its mostly just them making stupid jokey small talk and acting like white trash look i love britneys music as much as the next babe but this show is just pure filler for a nation so addicted to britney that they would watch her clip her toenails yes that could be an actual episode thank god these two broke up because they were painfully dull together this show is toxic,negative,0
with its ww2 timing falling in and out of love and easy on the eye kira this is reatonement   this a relationship story with focused main characters working out the the balance between first and fast love in the home front of ww2 poet dylan thomas philanders his way between wife and ex in dark and smoky blitz london and later in windy wales   veras ex and next spark off each other as the poet and soldier become a sideline while the girls bond and share an easy watch that works well in the era bouncing along with just a few dips in pace would work well with french subtitles but then i may have been to too many art house movies lately,positive,1
what a waste of time ive tried to sit through sky captain about 6 times and every time within about 3 minutes i start doing something else  anything else its a downright boring movie the acting is terrible the writing dull and obviously a firsttime director because its stiff and i wanted to love it i love scifi the old cliffhangers and i can appreciate the attempt at nods to flash gordon and metropolis but my god what a waste of money i used to work for paramount pictures and i had written sherry lansing in 1993 about using blue screen for screen tests she told me theyd never have an interest or need to do it 10 years later paramount releases this piece of crap sherry was right in 1993 but must have forgotten her own advice when she greenlighted this dog blue screen an effect shot but not an entire movie lets not forget neither jude nor jolie are terrific actors but easy on the eyes paltrows performance reminds me of a high school effort too bad  it couldve worked but only under a skilled director the funny thing is sky captains director will keep getting work even after this dreck its commerce not art,negative,0
this is a very strange film by directoranimator richard williams all who know of williams work know its a bit offkilter if not ingenious but this one takes the cake  it features two hapless ragdolls who have to save their owners new french doll from a lustful pirate toy and find themselves at the mercy of several bizarre characters along the way the strength in this movie lies primarily in its aesthetic quality its strange character designs its powerful animation and its stark contrast of the sweet and scary williams brilliant animation portrayed raggedy ann and andy as real rag dolls floppy and darned rather than simple cartoon versions of the dolls which made it more believable at least in a visual sense the animation shines on the bring us the camelwiththewrinkledknees whose body walks with two different personalities controlling each end the silentmovie chase with sir leonard looney and of course the greedy  the greedy animation on its own is possibly the most exquisite psychedelic animation ive ever seen theres something about this animation that just makes your jaw dropand every second its something new living in what was deemed the taffy pit the greedy is a massive blob man that lives in and mercilessly eats sweets he sings a song that i cant help but feel hold some sexual undertones then tries to kill raggedy ann for her candy heart  the only complaint i have about this film is that there are too many songs it continuously bogs down the movies pace because there are sixteen of them there are about six good songs which should have been the only ones including i look and what do i see no girls toy blue though they didnt need to make him sing it twice i never get enough because i love you and maybe im home the others just seem unnecessary and frankly arent too amazing to listen to  this is a weird film with strange undertones but if thats what youre looking for you wont find better,positive,1
this film is simply appalling how the talent involved made this is beyond human beliefiguess they must have been boozing when they thought of this ideai feel as if 2 hours of my life have been taken from meharvey kietel will try and distance himself from this rubbish it should have been a great crime movie but it develops into a gory mess of vampiresi would recommend this film to people who like to sleep through movies you wont miss a thingthe humour is set to appeal to the lowest common dominate movies can uplift us and remind us that life is worth living this film just depresses youas deniro said in one movie the saddest thing in life is wasted talent this film is a perfect example of this statement,negative,0
i watched this today partially attracted to the allstar cast and partly because i have enjoyed so many other films of this ilk however this is one to avoid there are dozens of badly cut scenes where the continuity just does not flow the billiards challenge at the start for example the fighting scenes with the natives are about as good as you would remember in those old black and white tarzan movies you know where you see a spear fly through the air and camera cuts to a dead native lying motionless on the floor with it sticking from his thigh is that instantaneous death there are also several quite unnecessary scenes which have nothing to do with the plot like the little girl being rescued while collecting flowers the really badly animated clay toys are too painful to watch if you do see this movie the crabs which inch forward at about 5kph are the highlight somehow one manages to creep up on david mccullum and give him a nip its as if there was no time to get out of the way like when the obelisk in the city falls over the native has all the time in the world to take a 2 step to the left but no he screams and it falls on him i only give this a 2 because of ekland and why does mccullums voice develop a stutter as the movie progresses,negative,0
as a cinema fan white noise was an utter disappointment as a filmmaker the cinematography was pretty good nicely lit good camera work reasonable direction but as a film it just seamed as predictable as all the other so called horror movies that the market has recently been flooded with although it did have a little bit of the chill factor the whole concept of the evo electronic voice phenomena didnot seem believable this movie did not explain the reasonings for certain occurrences but went ahead with them the acting was far from mind blowing the main character portrayed no emotion like many recent thrillerhorror movies  definitely not a movie i will be buying on dvd and would not recommend anyone rushes out to see it,negative,0
i am a massive fan of jet li he is the best hk action film star alive and consequently  this film rocked i saw it in the video store and as it was in the mainstream section of this mainstream video store i didnt register its presence at first and had to look twice i immediately knew what i would be renting out my only qualm i suppose i expected it is that it was dubbed aaargh and not subtitled elsewise the movies originalstrangecool plot and full on action made it one of jet lis better movies even though they all fall under that category,positive,1
very nicely done movie it does stay in your memory better billed as a romance than flying or war altho the flying parts are realistic and almost error free flying buffs like myself will enjoy this movie even if attracted by the airplanes unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love  fun watching early crowe he is good and exudes charm his reading of high flight is superb  cheers boom,positive,1
maybe im being too generous with the ratingbut i just love this movie ive seen it so many times but every time i see it i fall in love with it all over again its just a simple romantic comedy with nothing huge or monumentous that happens but im a big romantic and this movie is romantic i love meg ryan and tim robbins and walter mathau is so funny the scientists make me laugh so muchi definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasnt seen it its such a clean good movie  and those are so rare now my 20yearold brother likes this movie too so its not just a chickflick  i recommend it if you need to laugh or if youre just lonely and need to watch a romance if you yourself cant participate in one its a good un,positive,1
true there are many movies much worse then this movie this movie was no manos the hands of fate or troll 2 yes i have seen them both twice but at the same time this movie is no alien predator or even alien vs predator yes even that movie surpassed this movies like this make battlefield earth look like a star wars it is so bad razzie awards lookout your biggest competition has just arrived in theaters this film im talking about is of course alone in the dark ill try to take you though a step by step process on why this film was so bad  acting ill first start off with what perhaps was the best component of this film next to the ending credits which played wish i had an angel the acting christian slater must be proud of himself he successfully proved that it is possible to act decent in a film worse then drinking antifreeze though all his awful dialog he had to speak it made me wonder why he just didnt walk off the set halfway perhaps it was because of stephen dorff being in the film as well somebody he wishes he could be but fails at it tara reid is a bad actress but good looking and thats all that really matters in films like these that is not to say the acting was perfect though it was average not good and perhaps the only thing in the film not good  the soundtrack except for wish i had an angel the soundtrack is pointless and bad heavy medal being pumped into the viewers ears perhaps to disguise the awful story something i will get to soon a long and very expensive 2 cd soundtrack is now up for sale for those musically challenged  the directing directed by hollywoods favorite director uwe ball who brought us the classic house of the dead telling us yes movies can get this utterly bad and thats just the beginning to my deadly saga of awful movies at least it is said to be directed by uwe ball without being told i would have guessed a monkey was kidnapped from the congo brought here and forced to make opinions on how to make the movie under penalty of being shocked the director of photography was probably a camcorder taped onto a skateboard and pushed forward until it hits a wall on the scenes where the camera should stay still it is constantly moving not allowing us to stop anywhere and when it should be moving in action the camera stops for some reason  the producing who on earth is stupid enough to put money towards this bomb i pity the fool sometimes sometimes im glad he or she was taught such a lesson to never put money towards garbage worse then dog dung tied up in a bag  the writing  storyboard trying to analise the story is more painful then jamming an ice pick under a big toe and kicking a soccer ball as hard as i possibly could with it right after but i will still attempt it  edward carnby escapes as a child from an orphanage where 20 children where to go under science experiments he escapes and hides in an electrical outlet where he is electrocuted this is the point where it got so bad i started to laugh out loud then it fastforwards many years later where hes a paranoia detective he gets attacked by some zombie that cant be shot to death kills it and moves on with life later on he gets attacked by some crazy looking monster and he discovers secrets that nobody else knows  yeah the plot is bad really really bad the film beings with expecting us to read approximately 10 minutes which felt like 100 of random text about an untrue civilization called the abskani the film goes not to have one twist after another more then the audience can handle more then the audience wants to handle more then the audience could ever care about this storyline is rock bottom bad that even double dragon does better  overall miss out on this movie i gave it a 1 out of 10 but that is because there is no 0,negative,0
it is not the same as the other films about dancing a few normal people found themselves from dancing unlike the dancing films in hollywood the characters in this film are not handsome or hot young people they are someone that you may see everyday in your offices they are some depressed about their lives and finally find themselves and their dreams from dancing this touches me very deeply,positive,1
well i have to disagree with leonard maltin on this animated short he loves it and claimed it was hilarious i enjoyed it but didnt see any humor he doesnt even like hockey or know anything about it and still loved the story living right across the border from canada i have watched hockey for 50 years both there and in buffalobut i didnt think much of this cartoon oh it was interesting and i know what would happen if you wore a toronto jersey up in the quebec area  disaster that especially holds true in the glory years of les canadians however that doesnt make the story funny   back in the 1950s everyone in the quebec provinces idolized the montreal canadians and their star player maurice richard and everyone wanted to be like him when his mother orders a new sweater it has the toronto maple leafs emblem on it so the kid doesnt want to be caught dead wearing it when he finally does and heads to the local rink he gets ostracized from the rest of his hockey buddies whats so funny about that i could see the same thing happening to a kid in boston who is red sox diehard and his mom gets him yankees shirt horrors you couldnt wear it and viceversa  maybe to someone who doesnt follow sports at all like maltin this situation seems odd and humorous to himbut its a fact of life or any bittime sports fan and his favorite team it was an interesting story and totally believable but nothing that made me laugh  the art was fun to look at throughout almost like looking at a long series of crayon paintings done by a talented school kid the french canadian accent was good too this movie was part of the dvd leonard maltins animation favorites from the national film board of canada,positive,1
whats this a canadian produced zombie flick that i have never heard of before a mortician works on the body of a recently deceased young man this allows for an extended flashback that show how the guy got there basically he and friends went to a cemetery on friday the 13th and raised the dead thanks to his silly chanting cut back to the morgue where our dead body comes back to life and kills the mortician and owner who gets his eyes popped out the final wtf shot has the funeral home owner in a straight jacket and screaming im not crazy amazingly he has his eyeballs back  running a scant 58 minutes this is certainly one oddity in zombie cinema it feels a lot longer but put me in some kind of trance where i couldnt stop watching the film also has one of those if you see this image turn away from the screen gags it is the image of an old man getting sick in a theater prophetic and when he pops up only twice the blood begins to flow the scenes are pretty damn gory for the time period there is a great gaffe where a zombie chops off a girls right hand with a shovel but  when he pulls the fake hand into the frame to chomp on  it is a left hand,negative,0
it isnt the worst film ever made the actors arent apalling and the script and director are not completely inept   it isnt the best film ever made the actors arent excellent and the script and director are not completely brilliant  it falls somewhere in the middle a fun somewhere an enjoyable well constructed somewhere  no need to say dont take it seriously or so bad its good or it wasnt scary none of these comments are relevant   cut has atmosphere its that atmosphere which is actually very unique and the one really original aspect of the movie which personally is what makes the film for me,positive,1
perhaps the worst of the nemesis films and that says a lot this mess features so many flashbacks to part 2 that you might as well say that youve seen them both even if youve only endured this entry making matters worse are two wisecracking cyborgs who have absolutely no entertainment value in other words they are a perfect fit for this endlessly boring cinematic mistake,negative,0
i am surprised that so many viewers didnt find all the symbolism in the movieits what made the movie an incredible work of art the story deals with some of the saddest content a movie could hold yet it is one of the best movies ive ever seen because of the need for your own imagination and the brilliance in the storyline  if you will pay close attention the message is there the younger brother is killed by the stepfather the older brother made up the story about the wagon flying as a way to deal with the pain of his brothers death there are those that would argue why would he lie to his own children with the story to me the answer is because he doesnt want to share such ugliness with his own children or that he has blocked it out and replaced his memory of the horrific event with the thought of his brother flying away to safety ive read some of the reviews that believe he was an only child and that he created the younger brother as an escape to deal with the abuse he suffered although this is an interesting idea  i love the imagination used to come up with that i dont think he would have lied to his own children about having a little brother but i do find it plausible that he would have lied about his little brothers death however i like that idea of an ending much better than the notion that the movie had no symbolism at all  there are many different takes you can have on the movie but if you take the movie at face valuetwo brothers creating a wagon that flies to escape an abusive stepfather  youve missed the brilliance the fact that i was able to see the subtle messages in the script were what made the movie so incredible to me it requires your own thought process and your own imagination to make it workdig deep when you watch it youll be amazed at the genius contained in the film the only other movie ive seen as close to this in symbolism and subtle messages is pleasantvillebut thats a comment for another movie,positive,1
i am not a footie fan by any means but watched this with a friend as there wasnt anything else on the box at the timethank goodness not only did we laugh from start to finish but about a week later in the pub when we started discussing it we made a right spectacle of ourselves with uncontrollable laughter does that sloping pitch actually exist i have released my email here so if anyone hears about its future availability or a repeat on the telly please let me know definitely the funniest thing ive seen on television king leek was good too another tim healy classic,positive,1
this movie tries hard but completely lacks the fun of the 1960s tv series that i am sure people do remember with fondness although i am 17 i watched some of the series on youtube a long time ago and it was enjoyable and fun sadly this movie does little justice to the series  the special effects are rather substandard and this wasnt helped by the flat camerawork the script also was dull and lacked any sense of wonder and humour other films with underpar scripting are home alone 4 cat in the hat thomas and the magic railroad and addams family reunion  now i will say i liked the idea of the story but unfortunately it was badly executed and ran out of steam far too early and i am honestly not sure for this reason this is something for the family to enjoy and i was annoyed by the talking suit despite spirited voice work from wayne knight  but the thing that angered me most about this movie was that it wasted the talents of christopher lloyd jeff daniels and daryl hannah all very talented actors jeff daniels has pulled off some good performances before but he didnt seem to have a clue what he was supposed to be doing and elizabeth hurleys character sadly came across as useless daryl hannah is a lovely actress and generally ignored and i liked the idea of her being the love interest but sadly you see very little of hernot to mention the monster attack is likely to scare children than enthrall them likewise with wallace shawn as some kind of government operative christopher lloyd acquits himself better and as an actor i like lloyd a lothe was in two of my favourite films clue and who framed roger rabbit and i am fond of back to the future but he was given little to work with and had a tendency to overact quite wildly  overall as much i wanted to like this movie i was left unimpressed instead of being fun it came across as pointless and that is a shame because it had a lot of potential with some talented actors and a good idea but wasted with poor execution 110 bethany cox,negative,0
okay it features one lovely blinkandyoumissitjoke when the dead are rising from their tombs the names of the old time horror directors like jacques tournier and jean yarborough are featured in the tombstones and the smashing of morally bankrupt repuconrightist villains is ontarget whorish skanks preaching morals etc but why these soldiers are antirepublicans because they have gone to the war most of them should be republicans right why they dont go to killing the enemies who killed them or something why they all want to vote against the republicans why this story has made of a movie questions never answered,negative,0
michael haneke is known for his disturbing movies like funny games this time he adopted elfriede jelineks die klavierspielerin which is probably her best work so far jelinek always writes about abusive behaviour in families and especially of the suppression of women in a patriarchal society  erika kohut isabelle huppert works as a piano teacher at the viennese consevatory she still lives with her mother annie giradot they even sleep in the same bed already a hint of something strange erika bullies her students the same way shes bullied by her mother and secretly watches porn movies and plays sadomasochistic games with herself a student walter benoit magimel falls in love with her but she refuses to simply sleep with him she wants to play her games with him but hes disgusted he reluctantly follows her rules which means disaster for both of them  haneke has a very clear picture language everything is filmed in a almost spartanic way so the complex characters and story are enhanced  people who dont know austria very well may be dont realize how essential the setting is for the story jelinek as well as other great austrian writers like thomas bernhard suffers from the coldness and casualness in austrian families and society austrians at least viennese people are often unable to articulate their pains wishes they suppress their emotions so there often enough is no real love affection and nearness in their families in a society where its more important to show a perfect facade to society even if this means to protect crimes within families as erika and her mother protect walters rape of erika to avoid a scandal than to deal with your emotional problems its probably no wonder that sigmund freud founded the psychoanalysis in vienna erika has a cold and distant relationship with her mother they only time they share some emotions is very violent and not at all loving erika replaces her hidden emotions with wishes for violence so that she can finally release some feelings but she has nobody who really wants to speak about her emotions so in the end she has to stab herself to ease her inner pain  isabelle huppert shows her best performance of her career as well of most other actresses with a unsmiling face you often see only a hint of emotion in her face a quick smile a glance with her eyes and in the end her pain is masterly displayed without a single tear   benoit magimel and annie giradot also turn in powerful performances but the movie belongs to huppert,positive,1
one your screen will be filled with beautiful effects and colours these do nothing for the story but they will keep your lazy eyes occupied for some 50 minutes a good example is the eternal use of a computer screen that shows each fingerprint from the database as that print is compared with the one they want to find out about yeah right  two these guys being like real professional pros they will engage each other in intriguing pro talk look grissom these are what we call fingerprints everybody has them and they are different on each person so with these fingerprints we can actually find  yup exactly like real pros would talk to each other if there wasnt a completely uninformed and stupid audience around  however not everything about this show is bad some stories work to some degree and the colours are really beautiful they use red blue green yellow all of them colours ive loved since kindergarten,negative,0
it would be unwise to judge that that either narrative or documentary to be more authentic than the other both formats have an underlying form of fiction and are never a true reflection of reality as producers seek to reconstruct and narrate stories in their perspectives as both formats usually leaves some issues undiscussed due to complexities of subplots and screen time it denies viewers the opportunity to open up debates and to further investigate and construct the real truth adding to the viewers inability to evaluate sources eg comparisons with written history and the logics behind arguments history may be open to distortion through narrative and documentary  to most people documentary may be seen more truthful as it usually involves actual participants testimonies and reallife footages however these visuals are selected and edited to be arranged in a way that allows producers to present their version of realism to the viewers in the real buddy holly story paul mccartney seeks to establish the buddy holly as remembered by family and friends and how buddy had influence the rest of the music world the testimonies may have been distorted as memories may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to make a legend out of buddy the documentary did make corrections to the film version and cover other events such as there were 3 members of crickets and that buddys music was actually heard outside of usa at that time he had to embark on a world tour however it did not go into deep discussion about what happened to buddys wife after his death criticism andor negative discussions may have been left out of the documentary as the producers seek to present a buddy that the world should have remembered eventually we dont manage to construct the whole truth as we only restrict ourselves to the past realties that the documentary tells us  personally i prefer a narrative film because it provides rich visual imageries which helps us to reconnect with the collective memory of that era it gives the audiences a more constructive structure of the story and this leads to better memory retention for the audiences when they retell the story there is also an element of flexibility which allows filmmakers to express their thoughts and views on certain issues in the buddy holly story racial issues were highlighted and viewers can certainly relate to these issues with respect to current situations  moviegoers consistently seek to revisit certain emotions when watching a film and using these emotions audiences can choose to make personal connections with the applied meanings that a filmmaker wants to deliver in most stories people are more likely to selectively remember the struggles the inspirations and the way the story ends through the buddy holly story we do remember the struggles buddy and the crickets had how maria had been a source of encouragement and that buddy holly was a great performer until the day he dies,positive,1
i havent seen this film for over 20 years but it had such an impact on me that i remember sitting through the credits and for several minutes after in complete awe this is one of the most underrated films of the entire decade in which it was originally released i just ordered a copy of it on dvd and paid for overnight shipping and cant wait for it to arrive it is uplifting at times and also very dark and somewhat disturbing its a story of a closeknit band of regular kids growing up in the inner city and makes one feel as though they are actually sitting on the sidelines rather than watching on a movie screen or television hard to explain but it is something that must be experienced the story starts at childhood and tracks the lives of the four main characters through high school and as they embark on their separate journeys in life the entire cast did an incredible job and its by far the best work of jodi thelens career im hoping that the dvd lives up to my memory and plan on watching it this friday with a good friend,positive,1

just so that you fellow movie fans get the point about this film i decided to write another review i missed a few things out last time  first the script second the acting third jesus christ what were they thinking making a piece of garbage like this and then expecting us to enjoy it when there are no redeeming features whatsoever from beginning to end except when joseph fiennes finally gets blown away in a very unexciting climax  i cant believe i wasted my money on this when i could have given it to a homeless person or a busker or something  are you getting the picture,negative,0
terry and june was one of the classic british sitcoms in my opinion you knew what to expect  and aint that just so typical  unlike modern sitcoms with utterly contrived plots this show is still a breath of fresh air how lovely not see or hear remarks about bodily functions or not to see a family perpetually late for breakfast or a family with impossible teenagers and therein is the secret terry  june was based on a middle class couple living in relative harmony in stead of todays strained plots with the de rigueur dysfunctional family made to look hip  personally i vote the bridge to far episode as one of the best in a way terrys antics reminds me of basil fawlty  both sometimes getting almost impossibly embarrassing  terry  june comes highly recommended have your tea and biscuits ready,positive,1
apparently recut episodes from the gangbusters tv show on the big screen while this was frequently done in the 50s and 60s because people didnt have a tv or a color tv and producers wanted an increased return on their investment big screen ticket sales or if it went to the small screen resale of a series that isnt in syndication the results were usually less then the sum of their parts the only time ive ever seen it work were where multipart stories were put together ala rocky jones or man from uncle or in the case of horror anthology the veil and 13 demon street here the effect is to have stories of american criminals in the 20s and 30s dillinger pretty boy floyd bonnie and clyde etcintercut with each other as a narrator talks about how the fbi hunted them down its a weird concoction that doesnt quite work because its clear that there are things here that dont belong together more than once i looked at the tv oddly because things didnt seem right in fairness i wont describe the cheapness of the production since this was what early tv and the series was like its not bad but its not very good either to be perfectly honest the episodes of the series that ive seen work better a single episodes where were not expecting as much given the choice id rent dvds of the show instead of this movie,negative,0
i actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule and amazingly i found it really original i have commented on other colombian films before and i agree that colombian movies tend to have a similar scheme and always try to make reference to the average vulgar peopleespecially trying to make jokes out of the continuous cursing but lets face it the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated unfortunately this is how real people speak the storyline and the pacing are brilliant and it could be extrapolated to any country in the world the acting was great and the script is to me one of the best ones ever produced in colombian soil i think that anyone around the globe can get a good one hour and a half of entertainment with a beautifully well directed bluffing black humor comedy it kind of reminded me of films like snatch and others of the sort i highly recommend it and hope it can be viewed by more people since colombian movies seem to have started to be more internationally focused since last year,positive,1
lets get this out of the way so the ones checking out this page looking for info on anything related to the word breasts and you know who you are googlers can move along this is not in any way pornographic on the contrary if this has any value as masturbation material then frankly the filmmaker didnt do a good job since the aim is to keep it on subject and on the experiences of women and their bodies and images of themselves and society and health and so on indeed i would be a little circumspect of one who came across this on dvd or if it ever plays again late night on hbo or cinemax and used it as a means for pleasure you might as well go to the supermarket and pick up a pair of ripe melons and take them home and squeeze them and uh well you get the idea  no this is semiserious filmmaking meant for premium latenight viewing but it shouldnt have to be just for the latenight types this is intimate in setting but not in tone all of the women in all their variety of shapes and sizes and races and even with one man thrown in with fake breasts have something of value to say from life experience in the most straightforward way if i say semiserious its due to the several little segments that the director feels she needs to throw in with the archival footage of old howto videos about puberty and sex and breasts and superrare cartoons with the knockers flying about this isnt a problem but an asset we need a few little visual segways to go between these interviews  nothing is held back and we see it as feminism in a liberating form they dont need to cover up and even if they choose not to take their tops and shirts and bras off theyre still open as can be about a natural part of their body that is an object of sex surprise comfort discomfort curiosity motherhood and sadly cancer in that last part theres another brave step taken as we see a woman who survived her cancer with only one breast you know youve become mature and an adult when you can see this woman who has somehow gone on to live a seminormal life with one breast the most bittersweet moment is when she says if a fairy godmother said she could have one wish to have two full breasts she would have to think about it and you dont snicker or go eww gross thats the test folks  its not shot under the best of circumstances but then again for tv its edited with a tight pace its never dull for a moment and we never feel like anyone is holding back especially when a man might hear the hard truth like that breasts may not really be erogenous or that a flat chest is very attractive to some men breasts a documentary is about deconstructing myths with real faces and breasts and minds and hearts laid bare if thats worthy of a i was alone session then well more power to you i guess though its not the intention,positive,1
highlighting the acting of sidney poitier and the brooding onscreen presence of john cassevetes the edge of the city is a highlywatchable film from the fifties directed by martin ritt there is great acting and stunning onlocation photography in black and white  poitier is a delight at this point in his career and tommy tyler the character he plays is happy and outgoing he befriends axel noordman played by cassevetes who is a young man suffering from poor selfesteem and a past that he wants kept under wraps tyler a black man brings his friend out of his shell and introduces him to his family and a new girlfriend  tyler and noordman are employed on the new york docks at a time when the workers were expected to tow the line if they knew what was good for them the boss charles malik played by jack warden in one of his many hardbitten roles becomes the focus of discontent which leads to a climactic showdown with noordman  at the end of the movie we are left with mixed emotions however the two main characters have left the audience with a story of friendship between two different men in a hostile world,positive,1
why do people who do not know what a particular time in the past was like feel the need to try to define that time for others replace woodstock with the civil war and the apollo moonlanding with the titanic sinking and youve got as realistic a flick as this formulaic soap opera populated entirely by lowlife trash is this what kids who were too young to be allowed to go to woodstock and who failed grade school composition do ill show those old meanies ill put out my own movie and prove that you dont have to know nuttin about your topic to still make money yeah we already know that the one thing watching this film did for me was to give me a little insight into underclass thinking the next time i see a slut in a bar who looks like diane lane im running the other way its child abuse to let parents that worthless raise kids its audience abuse to simply stick woodstock and the moonlanding into a flick as if that ipso facto means the film portrays 1969,negative,0
a lot has already been said on this movie and i d like to join those who praised it its a highly unique film which uses elements of different genres drama comedy gangster film without making a mess of it at points you just laugh out loud at other points you feel for the characters whose mistakes and failures you watch sabus genius can be shown with regard to some sequences of the movie one is that where all three men chasing one another have an erotic day dream about a young woman that they just passed by on the street this sequence is beautifully done and illustrates the characters of all three runners very well it is erotic and funny at the same time another example of sabus genius is the part of the film where the runners get tired first one of them the typical loser among the three guys hallucinates that the woman that left him for someone else is back again and you see them dancing with one another and in the next shot him dancing with himself which is deeply moving all of the runners get to this point where they think that have something back they lost or are on track again and at one part of the movie they stop chasing each other running in line just laughingso here is it all the beauty and the ludicrousness of what we call life which sabu manages to show throughout the film his characters fail do they at the end but he doesnt rob them of their dignity monday and postman blues that do justice to sabus claim that he is a genius go watch them  ,positive,1
spoilers  i hate this one but it is better than the others after this they just keep getting worse i hope gibson has the smarts to stay out of the next one a lot of the same with humor ie the toilet kids etc how much farther can we watch their relationship evolve drugs bad guys why south africa i found that unbelievable maybe south american some country in the golden triangle would have made the script better it seems the late 80 early 90s had the blond bad guys ie die hard the mighty ducks play ice land gary busey in the last weapon etc hollywood repeats itself over this one with a similar story has to go over the top the attacking the police the beach condo scene and the fight at the end and way over the top gibsons girlfriend killed by the copper attack were too much like many part 2s they get worse and 3 or 4 in this series picks up speed downhill 310,negative,0
the student nurses is an excellent film that deals with four women bonded by friendship and career for the first time one is able to see a realistic portrayal of relationships inside the work place outside the work place the risks of those relationships and the consequences this film also offers a rare chance to see veteran stage and television actress katherine scottie macgregor as the nurses instructor miss boswell ms macgregor is best known for her performance as mrs oleson on the television series little house on the prairie the direction music and print color are very good as well as the opening theme song performed by clancy b grass iii this film offers a rare opportunity for those who enjoy themes centered around the late 1960s and early 1970s which offers a softer side to life while appreciating the beauty of the female sex,positive,1
must confess to having seen a few howlers in my time but this one is up there with the worst of them plot troubling to follow sex and violence thrown in to disorient and distract from the really poorly put together film  i can only imagine that the cast will look back on the end product and wish it to gather dust on a shelf not to be disturbed for a generation or two sadly in my case i have the dvd it will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time,negative,0
this movie is brilliant  i dont remember this movie even being in theaters so thinking it was a straight to dvd i have fairly low expectations even though i am a big fan of mike judge it has some of the same kind of comic future satire as brazil and demolition man but taken to the next level  then i saw the cast luke wilson maya rudolph and dax shepard who were all brilliant in their roles  needless to say this movie won me over in the first 5 minutes where it shows aboveaverage people having fewer children and the poorest stupidest trashiest people having lots of ignorant children and how this is leading to a kind of reverse evolution it takes that concept and then shows where we are headed with this pollution of the gene pool  sadly i dont think it will take the 500 years as depicted but probably only about 50 i already see the shocking rise of mild retardation in the general populace media and culture people who like classical music and art are ridiculed instead of respected the lowest common denominator seems to rule especially in hollywood and on tv eg jackass the movie and any reality show where they make you eat something disgusting or humiliate yourself for money  all of the politicalsocial satire aside this movie is also just laugh out loud funny and i dont say that lightly few movies make me actually lol but this one did  a lot of the best jokes are wordsight gags in the background so you really have to pay attention to get some of them i even had to pause and zoom in for a few of them like when joe got his government id and for hair it said yes and for eyes it also said yes also the prison has engraved on the front house for particular individuals since the cops in the movie much like real life cops call everyone individuals instead of people etc again this was on the screen for just a momentthis is one of those movies you can watch again and again and dissect it to get through the layers of funny  also i normally watch movies with the subtitles on and that clued me in to some jokes that might pass by your ears in the dialog mix for instance the police constantly talk about people excaping instead of escaping and there are many other mispronunciations that just cracked me up but again i might not have picked up on them just by the dialog mixed with musicsound effects it is very subtle but still hilarious  additionally the special effects were really good for a scifisocial satire  i could go on and on but overall i think this is one of those movies that if you dont think its funny its probably making fun of you i plan on recommending this to many many people,positive,1
fever pitch isnt a bad film its a terrible film  is it possible american movie audiences and critics are so numbed and lobotomized by the excrement that hollywood churns out that theyll praise to the skies even a mediocre film with barely any laughs thats the only reason i can think of why this horrible romantic comedy and i use that term loosely because theres nothing funny in this film is getting good reviews  i sat through this film stunned that screenwriters lowell ganz and babaloo mandel would even for an instant think their script was funny  the brilliant nick hornby usually translates well to film he adapted fever pitch for a british film starring colin firth and ruth gemmell in 1997 peter hedges found hornbys voice for about a boy 2002 and when high fidelity was americanized for a movie in 2000 writers dv devincentis steve pink john cusack and scott rosenberg didnt go wrong because they kept the essence of hornbys wit and humor they made one of the best films of that year  so why does the american version of fever pitch go so painfully awry the british version wasnt a masterpiece but it was charming funny unexpected and gave us two characters we could like respect and understand  but ganz and mandel have excised everything funny in hornbys work in americanizing the story theyve butchered it removing all that was good and unique about hornbys work and replacing it with conventional drivel  theyve transformed a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy never once veering from the wretched formula lindsey drew barrymore has three girlfriends each of whom has a distinct function ones overweight the seconds cynical and ambitious and the thirds a romantic want to guess how many male friends ben jimmy fallon has  what made high fidelity such fun was not only a good leading man and lady but engaging supporting characters in this fever pitch the six supporting friends do or say nothing especially funny theyre so insignificant theyre not even decorative the only reason theyre in the film is because the formula demands it poor ione skye winds up as one lindseys pals in a thankless role the lovely skye must have been wishing lloyd dobler would swoop in and take her away come to think of it cusack wouldve made an excellent ben of course cusack is too smart to attach himself to such an utterly tedious script  there isnt a single solitary moment in this film that seems original or unforced every plot turn is predictable every lame joke telegraphed ganz and mandel labor for laughs the first 45 minutes are so excruciatingly slow you wonder if these chaps realized they were writing a comedy you can mark the plot turns in this film by your watch its almost as if ganz and mandel penned this with some screen writing gurus formula pasted on the wall when they got to a certain page they looked up at the formula and said ok the guru says this has to happen now and presto  directors bobby and peter farrelly dont help the film any they have no concept how to introduce their story and characters they hand over the vo narration not to the protagonist but to another guy who sits behind ben at fenway park thanks to some extremely clunky writing we have to watch barrymore and fallon stumble through their unfunny initial meetings  barrymore does cute and adorable better than most shes as good at it as goldie hawn in her heyday but even her cuteness cant save this extraordinarily awful film she tries hard to wring some energy and humor out of this story about 30 minutes into the film lindsey tells ben youre funny the only explanation for her remark is that it was in the script for fallons ben never says anything even remotely funny fallon is neither witty nor funny when he does comedy he overacts  fallon was never any good on saturday night live he was quite possibly the least funny person on that show remember that lame sketch about a radio dj who did all the voices the only reason weekend update worked occasionally was because fallons cohort tina fey knows a thing or two about comedy  actors who think theyre funny and behave that way rarely if ever are actually funny thats true of fallon he thinks hes hysterically funny when he barely raises a chuckle his stuttering unsureofhimself shtick didnt work on the small screen its lousier on the big screen  unfortunately for fallon his role in this picture also requires a few dramatic moments if you thought his comedy was bad wait till you get a load of his dramatic stuff two scenes in particular  the first in a park the second in front of bens school  are painful to watch the scenes require an actor with a smidgen of dramatic ability but fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work his range of emotions doesnt even run the gamut from a to b  ben has no personality or depth often he comes across as an oaf and not a lovable one at that it boggles the mind what lindsey would find attractive about him compare fallons performance to firths in the british version and youll understand how terribly flat unfunny and forced fallons ben is and how wrong he is for this role watching fallon in fever pitch makes one long for the dramatic depth and comedic nuance of ashton kutcher  just as high fidelity did an americanized fever pitch couldve worked brilliantly it just needed better writers more competent directors and most definitely a stronger funnier smarter leading man do yourself a huge favor avoid this rotten film rent the 1997 british version and read hornbys book instead,negative,0
my friend zac rented this movie free of charge since his mom works at a rental store i still feel ripped off since i wont ever be able to get those 100 minutes of my life back having watched the first dark harvest the night prior to this viewing i expected to at least see a crappy remake of the first film wrong  there isnt a single scarecrow in the movie unless you count the one of the cover of the box nor are there any real death scenes the movie got its r rating from an 8 year old girl screaming god dn at her father  there is no amount of tequila that could make this movie bearable believe me we tried,negative,0
three young college women simona iva krajnc alja tanja potocnik and zana pia zemljic go on an adventure canoing down the river kolpa dividing their slovenia from neighboring croatia in this 2002 slovenian film by maya weiss what could have been an eastern european version of the wellknown and exciting 1972 deliverance turned out for me to be utterly uninspiring with flat character portrayals that denied sympathetic identification with the characters  alja and zana are not convincing as students at all though alja expresses a desire to be a writer and both use what seemed to me to be excessive bad language alja is bored with her boyfriend and seems to just be drifting along in life zana even less scholarly is a selfabsorbed adventure seeker with an attraction to other women i had some sympathy with relatively innocent simona conservative and starry eyed the very idea of these three traveling together just doesnt work for me the disdain that zana and alja show toward simona makes no sense  why would they choose her as a travel companion to start with as surely they must know her demeanor and attitudes  the three begin a carefree journey down the river on two canoes undeterred by a news story of a womans disappearance along the river things become more somber with the mysterious appearance sometimes real and sometimes possibly hallucinatory of a rabidly conservative fisherman politician jonas znidarsic  i did enjoy the scenes along the river and of small villages the trio visit it may be because of a lack of cultural understanding but the film didnt move me otherwise i was surprised to see that the film has won some awards,negative,0

uncompromising look at a suburb in 21st century vienna mixing the stories of six groups of characters by former documentary maker useidl is a provocative minimalistic and intense piece of observation cinema  after the worldwide spread of big brother reality shows hundstage takes modern voyeurism to an unsettling profound level hard to like but unignorable piece of european artcinema might seem cruel and seedy yet manages to convey the nihilistic alienated feeling of modern society in a praiseworthy manner  a must for lovers of world cinema,positive,1
when pam grier made coffy in 1973 it was an exciting though flawed film the plot was gritty and satisfyingeven if the acting was often amateurish it was so successful that american international pictures decided to rehash the formula the following year with foxy brownnot a bad film but certainly almost like coffy ii now only a year later the studio had apparently given up on creating anything new for ms grier as sheba baby was essentially the same plot from coffy and foxy brown yet again because the idea was so recycled and because the acting and acting are so tired and lowenergy its really scraping the bottom of the blaxploitation barrel  exactly like these other films sheba baby begins with some local black mobsters pressuring and eventually killing someone pam grier loves in the past it had been drug dealers and pimps now it was mobsters trying to run all the loan companies and pawn shops out of town so they can corner the market and like the other films pam is a onewoman hit squaddispensing justice and a good butt whoopin and like the other films there is a cat fight between pam and a white lady right in front of mr big and like the other films mr big is a white guy pulling all the strings and like the other films she is captured by mr big and like the other films he doesnt immediately kill her but gives her ample opportunity to escape here leaving a knife conveniently lying around and like the other films she eventually gets free and kills his jive  while this formula did seem interesting in 1973 by this film it was frankly a predictable bore even if you hadnt seen the other films it still was bad because the action was so slowthe punching and kicking seemed so slow and staged the same could be said for the gun play in one scene four guys with machine guns an ar15 and shotguns attack pam responds by opening fire with a 357 revolver and killing 3 of the 4 and getting the other to surrender even if shes a good shot she was rather slow and the guys just seemed to wait until she killed them plus even a world champion shooter or rambo couldnt have succeeded with such onesided oddsafter all these guys had very impressive weapons and they were already pointed at her when she cleverly whipped out her pistol and easily dispatched these professional hit men   in addition to slow and lame action scenes compared to any other blaxpoitation film the movie has many logical gaps that show the writing was terrible but the studio just didnt care in one case her boyfriend williams knew about the yacht and nutronic at the end of the film but pam never told himhow did he know about this in another the cops approach a boat filled with hoods and the hood immediately open fire however the cops had no evidence anything was happening and the crooks began firing with little provocation and the crooks had 30 caliber machine guns and other amazingly powerful weapons but in many cases were killed by cops wielding snubnosed 38s   the bottom line is that this is a great example of been theredone thata whole lot better i love blaxploitation films but this one is just too dopey and slow to merit watching except by very devoted fans of the genre,negative,0
this woman is a terrible comedian she cant crack a joke she has no real character this is another example of typical american rubbish that people laugh at because they have no idea how to react so they say to themselves well its a comedy show so ill laugh i guess  i cannot stand this miserable woman and her pi poor excuse for comedy she does not deserve anything but booing  why cant america dump this kind of turdish delight and go for something that actually contains humour  she is not funny not at all why oh why does even one person like this idiot,negative,0
i am still trying to figure out what the target of this movie was 1 whether to show how stupid disorganized unprofessional and arrogant the police is i surely could add various adjectives here but i think my point on this is clear 2 whether to show how a twistedminded crook that does not know what he wants from himself can create chaos 3 whether to show if a persistent detective will solve a case just by asking the criminal the same stupid question over and over again till the criminal answers 4 or was it just to show that any 90 minutes of filmed material can still be called a movie  this was one of those movies that in a way  did not disappoint me from the first 10 minutes i kind of figured out that this movie will not be nominated for the best movie award and surprisingly enough  this was consistent throughout the whole time it was stupid enough to be worth the wait to see how stupidly it will continue and end  and i was not disappointed there either   was it a complete waist of time yes which raises your question  why did i watch it throughout well i was trying to fall asleep and i thought this was a great candidate for that but unfortunately i had too much coffee before that,negative,0
the exploding zeppelins crashing down upon sky captain jude laws base present an adequate metaphor to describe how truly terrible this movie is first off let me state right off the bat that i sincerely doubt that paramount will ever recover any money from this film a cult hit it might become but only because it is so remarkable for what it failed to achieve i can see the studio pitch now lets combine 1920s german expressionism and a 1940s globetrotting adventure with a modern action flick and use computer animation to dominate every scene wow wont that be a success  skycaptain bludgeons the viewer with its sheer excess there are too many fake explosions too many unconvincing dogfight scenes and too few real moments where the characters are anything but painfully twodimensional after all why shock and awe with one floating airship when you can have three or five or one hundred moreover what could have been a groundbreaking film seamlessly combining computer generated imagery and human actors in a stylized and intriguing setting will instead become a flop in no small part because it fails to meet the most important requirement of any flick using cgi quite simply the graphics are amazingly poor from the movement of the cars to the physics of the aircraft in the dogfights everything seems to be just a little off im not being nitpicky here in any way an infant could notice that a car doesnt glide along the road like a maglev train unless its a mercedes s500 and for those of you raising your voices in protest crying out this is a stylized film its not supposed to be like reality let me just say this lord of the rings has set the standard for integrating reallife actors with cgi starship troopers has set the standard for ironic science fiction films the rocketeer did a solid job reintroducing the decade of the 1920s back into the hollywood film portfolio and tim burtons batman created a unique picture of new york citygotham that has yet to be repeated sky captain falls so short of all these films it is hard for me to mention them in the same sentence plus the acting is so poor it makes me positively ill so there you have it i spent 9 to see this film and you get my review i hope it might dissuade you all from making the same mistake that i did,negative,0
i bought this on dvd for my brother who is a big michelle pfeiffer fan i decided to watch it myself earlier this week  it is a reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines the section with michelle pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two she plays a rising hollywood actress who has had many short unfulfilling relationships she literally bumps into brian kerwin a regular married guy with kidsafter driving her car into the back of his after being initially hostile to one another he offers to drive her home as she no longer feels comfortable to drive romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out what happens at the end i was not prepared for but the slow pacing and routine tv direction takes any drama out of the plot  the other section involves an old studio boss played by darren mcgavin this section actually has the better cast with kenneth mcmillan lois chiles steven bauer  stella stevens they all want something from the studio boss but in the end when he is asked to resign they all realize their careers will now be going nowhere   it passes the time but is not all that interesting and i am glad this was not bought for me i am not a michelle pffeifer fan but she was admittedly the only actor worth watching in this film and even in 1983 she was a decent actress overall though unless you are a fan of hers avoid this as it is very routine,negative,0
ab tak chhappan is a fictitious story surrounding a police department in mumbai india sadhu agashe is a hard working hardedged cop heading up a plain clothed crime squad who makes a name for himself by killing dangerous criminals in staged police encounters rather than locking them up in prison his loyal officers obey him without question but a rift forms when one of his officers imtiaz becomes frustrated by sadhus high ranking status and is secretly competing with him for criminal kills and status a new recruit is also pushed into the fraternity and imtiaz is angry when sadhu allows him to take the lead on his first case further change comes in the form of a new police commissioner who disapproves of sadhus tactics and everyone gets caught up in internal politics  i was surprised to see such a well directed action thriller coming from india the camera work is excellent the story is well told and the tension is high when the drama unfolds the acting pace and political subterfuge convinces the viewer that they are a fly on the wall witnessing the blood sweat and tears from a close up and personal view and that the events are based on reality which is no doubt why we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film although it is likely that the director shimit amin has taken liberties with factual accounts nevertheless ab tak chhappan is an extremely polished piece of filmmaking,positive,1
this is my favorite horror film a close 2nd to poltergeist i saw one dark night when it first came out in theaters in 1983 at the theater where i worked  i was born in 1963 so i have a certain love for 80s horror films despite them being a little dated and the dialog not well written what i thought was so original about it was that the phenomenon of psychic vampirism has not been addressed at least to my knowledge at that time and is a very real phenomenon  i didnt care if adam west was in it nothing against him but his supporting role was not memorable but thought meg tilly was good casting the littleknown donald hutton from brainstorm and invaders from mars as an ambiguous scientist who oversaw studies on ramars abilities was sadly overlooked as a gay guy i was paying more attention to david mason daniels meg tillys unfortunate but gorgeous boyfriend hes selling real estate in texas now   i felt the film realistic in two ways raymar who was discovered to have murdered 6 girls in his surreal apartment had a funeral that was sparse in attendance reflecting the fact that not only was he mysterious a hermit but a killer as you know these types are buried without fanfare second if corpses were going to be telekinetically mobile they would hover dragging their feet the filmmakers could have gone for the schlock walking groaning arms outstretched zombies but opted for what would be believable kudos the buzzing electrical discharge from ramars eyes at his throne coffin like hes overseeing his kingdom of dead cast an eerie magenta light in the mausoleum that will stay with you for years if youve ever gone to a mausoleum even on a sunny day you will notice that they have their own rosetta lighting caused by stained glass windows dont get me started on the cavernous silence even ramar himself looked like someone who could pass as an eccentric perverted old man the score was oneofakind and memorable and i keep kicking myself for not getting it on cassette when it first came out the track shooting was done where it was supposed to be i especially liked the carefullyplanned characteristics of each corpse the bride the badly decomposed child still holding its teddy bear the grandmother the tall thin black guy and the halffaced world war ii vet and the greenslimed eyed elderly gent who was the first to greet the sisters clique initiators even corpses can be good actors i suppose the only thing i had to groan about was the arm that came out of one of the vaults and choke julies boyfriend couldnt possibly be done unless a corpse was put in laying on its stomach and feet first but why it looked a little to fresh too  the film begins eerie with us never seeing ramars face until the last quarter of the film which is like unwrapping a birthday present as he is picking up teen girl runaways in his daughters psychic flash we then see coroners hauling his body away in his one bedroom apartment where we see hes experimented his telekinetic craft by phasing dishes into his wall the rest does drag as the heatherslike sisters group baits julie into a final initiation by spending the night inside the mausoleum but it is a wellplaced build up to the unleashing horror later the movie isnt bloody in any sense of the word the goriest part is when ramars daughter uses a compact mirror to feed his power back to him and he bubbles then melts ive always felt that a power like ramars could never die and a sequel could be worth looking into i can see it now one dark night ii turning in the grave but lets face itthe film stands alone i heard the film had other titles but the original fits  a remake would be pointless but if there were to be one i would write better dialog and lengthen some scenes such as show the studies on ramars abilities done in the lab instead of hearing about it on a tape recorder in this information age something like that would be well documented on dvd and more corpses why just raise the ones in the mausoleum when ramars power could spread to the graveyard too lets just say id hate to be one of the persons who had to clean up the mess at the end of the climax something that too can be shown i think having one of the initiating sisters recognize one of the corpses as a relative would have added some good if disturbing character with cg effects some awesome scenes with ramar animating cremated remains would be off the wall   say what you will aboutone dark night but it has it all so see at least once in your lifeor death,positive,1
i guess its jacks great empathic ability that makes him the powerful performer that he is but empathy comes at a price like all thingswhen hes surrounded by mediocrity he instinctively lowers the standard and becomes one with it he is a joke as a mafiahitmanalso because the part doesnt suit him one bit him being so extrovertedand just grazing avoids making a fool of himself in thiskathleen turner had a much tooooo long career just by being tall and blonde because her acting ability is limited to that thing she does with her eyes when she opens them wide which shes convinced is sooooo damn sexy and anjelica huston is the absolute samegranted interesting in everything just like robert loggia   the movie is a lame draftand this will be the only mention of the rag they call script of a gangstermovie with a cast that was probably only interested to get to the afterparty fasterthey certainly gathered the partygoing elite in this what did they shoot it in 1 daycause that would be the only explanation,negative,0
anyone who has read my review for uwe bolls alone in the dark will remember that i compared the unenviable task of sitting through that piece of human waste to having each and every hair on your arm pulled out well take that analogy a step further with this irredeemable gutter trash and try to imagine the pain of getting your teeth extracted without novacaine do that and youll have a general idea of what eli roths cabin fever is all about  i never believed any one film was capable of topping the sheer agonizing dreck that uwe boll cranks out as the worst film ever made but in all honesty i have to say cabin fever comes very close this is yet another sad excuse for a motion picture that had absolutely no valid reason to meet with any form of theatrical release for somebody who claims to love the horror genre as much as eli roth does he has created the single most annoying and convoluted patchwork of a movie i think i have ever seen in my entire life how do you screw up a story like this think of the potential this plot would have had without the poorly written characters without the bad writing and without all that unnecessary and unfunny comedy a movie dealing with a grotesque flesheating virus could and should have been so much better than what roth dished out for us here this script failed on so many levels with me and while i do not doubt the evident talent this director possesses i do know that he fumbled the ball big time on an idea that could very well have redefined the horror genre  to say this was a production of missed opportunities would indeed be a gross play on words a generous amount of blood and unsettling special effects cant even save it and that is one element i normally go for there really was nothing about cabin fever that i could easily recommend to anybody when three quarters of the crowd walks out of the theater halfway through you know the movie is sinking fast my best advice to those reading this would be to simply rent before purchasing one viewing was more than enough for me to know that i will most likely never bother with it again,negative,0
this is no arthouse film its mainstream entertainment   lots of beautiful people ta and action i found it very entertaining its not supposed to be intellectually stimulating its a fun film to watch jesse and chace are funny too which is just gravy definitely worth a rental  so in summary id recommend checking it out for a little friday night entertainment with the boys or even your girl if she likes to see other girls get it on  the villains are good too vinnie corey large the hatian guy from heroes very nasty villains,positive,1
i have to admit i laughed a few times during this trivial 2004 holiday movie but its already moving out of my shortterm memory in a career that is sliding rather swiftly toward tabloid obscurity ben affleck once a promising comic character actor who became enmeshed in the hollywood publicity machine to recreate himself into a romantic leading man judging from this film the transformation doesnt seem to be taking as he continues to lack the gravitas that would make him credible in such parts while his buddy matt damon takes on smart roles in films like syriana affleck appears in this type of commercial pap at least the superficial character of successful but lonely advertising executive drew latham suits affleck better than most of the other roles he has tried  directed by mike mitchell whose most famous film is 1999s deuce bigelow male gigolo and scripted by no less than four screenwriters always a bad sign the flimsy plot revolves around his characters need to rent a family living in his childhood home in order to live out his fantasy of having the oldfashioned christmas he never had the concept is actually intriguing because there is something to be said about the cathartic release of sentimentality we are all directed to feel amid the frenzied commercialism around the holidays the real problem however is that the movie feels like an extended sketch lacking any logic or authentic emotional resonance affleck seems to be on overdrive attempting desperately to be lovable but the net result is an exhausting turn by an actor who has an increasingly annoying habit of playing stupid people in illconceived films fortunately he has the likes of james gandofini and catherine ohara playing the valcos the couple who decide to accept drews monetary offer to pretend to be his parents  gandolfini plays tom like a gruff nonviolent relative of tony soprano but he does what he can in the role from her classic sctv days to christopher guests mockumentaries ohara is always a comic gem no matter the vehicle and unsurprisingly she earns the best laughs as toms wife christine whether dryly delivering a oneliner or posing in an inch of makeup for a dominatrix photo shoot in what is becoming her standard screen role christina applegate plays their mistrusting daughter alicia who of course becomes drews love interest despite some good moments where she is enjoying the deceit of playing drews sister in front of his girlfriends family her character seems to change in lightningflash strokes making it hard to see what drew would see in her the story spins completely out of control by the last third with one contrived situation piled on top of another until plot strands are tied together in short order its rumored that much of the movie was improvised since there was no finished shooting script it shows but i also have to admit i stuck with it to the bitter end,negative,0
this show had a lot of hype but i didnt know about it until the midseason season 1 someone even recommended the show to me but i decided that if i was going to watch it i was going to wait until the end of the season so i could watch it in bulk due to the shows format im happy i waited i imagine it would have been fairly annoying have nearly every episode end in the middle of some cliff hanger then have to wait another week to find out what happens in the next second of the story  somehow this show has managed to throw in too much sex jason will have sex with pretty much anything that moves right after he finds out that one woman he had sex with was killed hes in bed with another woman the next night then tara and sam get it on despite each of them knowing that sam is in love with sookie and for some reason sookie gets mad when she later finds out about iteven though shes sleeping with a vampire one of the problems with the show is that it doesnt do a good job of making you care about the characters i really didnt care for jason at all along with his endless pursuit of tale he was rude to the people who actually were concerned for him after a few episodes i wouldnt have minded if he got killed somehow for that reason i was for the most part uninterested in the murders until sookies grandmother became a victim since the first two were more closely involved with jason  then once sookie and bill have sex the story gets a few more subplots taras mother wants an exorcism then the exorcist lady tries to convince tara that she should have one to remove her own demon i wasnt so much bothered by the whole exorcism thing as i know there are some people who really believe in that stuff however they waste little time in showing that is it a farce right after tara spends about 1300 on exorcisms for her and her mother at other points some of the developments happen too fast jason continues being a jerk trying to sell his grandmothers stuff to buy vampire blood which apparently is the new crack or something in his search he finds this girl who will do v vampire blood with him they get high and within three days fall in love with each other and kidnap a vampire for a constant source of v another example is when bill has to go to a vampire tribunal hes only gone for two days before sookie starts to feel abandoned and start to wonder if he thinks vampire politics are more important than her  subtlety is not this shows strong suit it doesnt take a genius to figure out something is going on with the local dog although my assumption wasnt dead on it wasnt that much of a surprise but the finale two episodes was where it really got annoying as it just shoved all the developments in your face as if you couldnt possibly figure the out for yourself when tara gets into the car accident the naked ladys face with the pig is clearly shown and was easily recognizable when she shows up at the jail for the bailout as if that wasnt enough they later show the lady again with the pig at her house then its time to wrap up the murder story at the end of the penultimate episode its revealed that renee is not who he says he is and most likely is the killer in the final episode they shove renee being the killer in your face sookie remarks that its odd that renees thoughts dont have an accent i thought that was fine as it adds to renee being a fraud but the next scene is full of incriminating evidence against renee they show that renee has the tape of maudette with the vampire and his fiancée finds a tape in one of renees boxes about how to fake a cajun accent at this point it was just ridiculous i mean we get it so blah blah blah stuff happens bill almost kills himself while failing to save sookie who still manages to kill renee they start to set up season 2 by leaving unfinished issues the naked pig lady and sam have a history lafayette has gone missing and might have been killed jason is in the process of being brainwashed into being a religious nut by some antivampire churchwhich makes me care about him even less  its almost surprising to see how many people absolutely love this show i think i just expected this show to be better im interested in seeing what happens in season 2 but if i watch it ill most likely wait for the season completion,negative,0
this bookbased movie is truly awful and a big disappointment weve been waiting for this move over a month many film reviewer were hopeful for it also in newspapers and tv it made big sense when 29th april comes many people regretfully noticed that movie is really awful why first of all story was so monotone it has been many indefinite scenes sometimes its hard to realize whats going on the actresses out of hulya avsar werent harmonized with their roles especially vildan atasever she acts better in comedy films in this movie a kind of drama she couldnt disposed of her previous role and finally movie is too short just 66 minutes,negative,0
its the single unfunniest thing i ever watched its sad how he tries so hard to come up with a good joke and all he does is curse and thinks his disgusting vulgarity is funny he is the most bitter person i ever saw his whole act he is trying to show how much he doesnt care and by that only showing how much hes angry at the critics and the people with any taste and sense of humor whod rather go through immense torture than go watch his show there are good comedians there are bad ones and there are horrible ones but this guy is in a league of his own i feel sorry for him and even more for the people who find him funny,negative,0
tim burton is in essence an expressionist filmmaker disinterested in dimensions of character and obsessed with gothic scope opting for style over substance incessantly throughout his career however with his style being so poignantly endearing i like many moviegoers forgive all the countless flaws that can be found in many of his movies and become engrossed in what are essentially one hundred million dollar art films  its almost embarrassing for me to see a poetic emotionally involving spirit within the second installment of a mediocre franchise especially when that franchises target audience are halfwitted 15 year old boys batman returns should have been every bit as commercial as its predecessor ensuring box office draw and cheap in actual fact very expensive thrills being entertaining without ever truly involving its audience had this been the result then tim burton would have surely been required to direct a third installment instead burton delivers something that can only truly be defined by the phrase out there  from the melancholy opening in which a high society couple throw a prisonlike bassinette containing their newly born deformed baby into a river it is clear that batman returns aint no picnic at buckingham palace cut to thirty three years later during a political speech made by bad guy business tycoon max shreck sinisterly portrayed by christopher walken the red triangle circus gang attack gotham city batman michael keaton returning to the role makes his first appearance sporting a new logo eventually saving the day shreck is soon kidnapped by the circus gang and blackmailed into endorsing the political return of the baby now a fully grown penguin man danny devito in hideously perfect makeup whose motives for return are suspicious only to batman  meanwhile shreck attempts to off his nosey and awkward assistant selina kyle played perfectly by michelle pfeiffer who quite frankly deserved more recognition for her performance who transforms into the deliciously sexy and psychotic catwoman out for revenge and harbours for some unexplained reason a deadly vendetta against the dark knight  batman returns is bleak the production design is breathtaking delivering a cold haunting gotham city with an even more apocalyptic feel than its predecessor danny elfmans score supports the film brilliantly ranging from invigorating to tragic the tone and direction of the whole film itself is intensely brooding shot like a sad nightmare burtons direction overshadows what is in fairness a diabolical screenplay with an almost totally irrelevant plot and yet at the same time perfect for burtons visual style of filmmaking and whilst burtons action sequences struggle for exhilaration the real excitement lies in the directional choices displaying the fall of each of its main characters the penguins demise the catwomans mental state and bruce waynes lonely destiny  warner brothers hated it whilst critical and audience reaction was mixed after all they wanted a batman sequel not a weird somewhat ghastly horror movie in which a deformed psychopathic orphan attempts to kidnap and drown a batch of babies allthewhile vomiting what can only be described as green mucus the production company wanted an audience friendly feature something for the mcdonalds clan to promote their happy meals with not a movie of dire irredeemable characters including a sexually repressed secretary who is pushed from a skyscraper and revived by a gang of cats awakening her from unconsciousness by chewing on her bloodied ice cold fingers  its easy to understand the mass disappointment that followed the release of batman returns the film never felt like a batman blockbuster it is questionable if burton really knew who batman actually was or even if he cared about the character as much as he cared about the film fitting in with his usual themes of beautifully haunting art direction and misinterpreted lonely characters who rarely conform with societies standards and expectations this is why burton failed to create a great batman film he did however create a nostalgic and stunning ballsy piece of cinema that remains a personal and nostalgic favourite of mine  this may not be a great batman movie but it is a great tim burton film,positive,1
i dont much mind the factors that others here have objected to  acting lighting and so forth for the most part these things were executed well enough to carry the film and put its points across its just a horror film after all  what bugged me were the points themselves because this is a deeply moralistic film and its morality is deeply tacky in fact its actually fundamentalist christian morality and this is a fundamentalist christian film look at the sins    sutherlands character picked on a kid at school when he was a preteen leading to his accidental death   baldwins character used masculine wiles persuasion and good looks to shag quite a few women some of whom he videotaped ooh the swine how unlucky for him that women are such passive gormless creatures that they had no complicity in the matter   roberts characters dad came back from vietnam a junkie so ashamed to be caught shooting up that he kills himself yes what a terrible sin why couldnt he have just become an alcoholic like all the others   and bacons character picked on another schoolkid how awful the fact that he was a child himself apparently counts for nought children it seems are divinely judged by adult criteria  well maybe lots of people support this level of moral absolutism it certainly seems to have gone unremarked in this movies comments does everyone just buy this stuff at least human laws treat children differently from adults recognising that their ethical sense is partiallyformed this film has no such qualms and i find that pretty objectionable ditto the notion that women are helpless fluffy creatures before young mens evil lusts or that a vietnam vet driven to drug addiction is so shameful that suicide is a valid option pathetic,negative,0
ida lupino is trapped in her own home by crazy robert ryan in beware my lovely a 1952 film from rko lupino and ryan did three films together and worked well as a team both being consummate professionals and strong performers in this film based on a broadway play called the man lupino is a world war i widow who rents out a room in her home shes very active and wellliked in her community and though her husband has been dead for two years shes not ready to move on the man who rents her room goes on vacation and lupino hires robert ryan to help her with some heavyduty cleaning in the house hes friendly enough to start but later terrorizes her locking her in the house and not allowing her to answer the phone or the door as he grows violent and more out of touch with reality  the character played by ryan is shown in the beginning of the movie running away when he discovers a dead body in another house hes working in it isnt clear whether or not hes the killer since he seems surprised to see the body he might be a split personality as when his personality turns ugly toward lupino he seems to have no memory of his activities when he comes out of it he doesnt know that he has the keys to lupinos house in his pocket and doesnt know why he has tickets to a party that he bought from young children who came to the door  beware my lovely is a very suspenseful film and the two leads give terrific performances the tension builds to a very high level and ends in a way youre not expecting,positive,1
this blake edwards film isnt too sure whether it wants to be a comedy a drama or a musical no matter the sheer presence of julie andrews is reason enough to see this comedydramamusicalspy spoof julie is beautiful and uses her many talents throughout the film rock hudson looks tired but hes is more than fine as julies romantic interest authentic world war i cars and planes add to the appeal overall the film is very entertaining the dvd release is an edited by blake edwards version of the original release supposedly this is the only version that edwards would allow but turner classic movies has shown the complete theatrical release version recently recommended,positive,1
over the last 20 years the majority of british films are about how horribly poverty stricken the uk is and how our youth doesnt stand a chance of a good life whilst they live on the mean streets of british cities the british film industry is obsessed with the idea of broken britain trainspotting this is england kidulthood football factory kes and from london to brighton  bullet boy is just another british movie added to that list the main character expresses a desire to go straight yet he still insists on hanging around with dead beats who carry guns and fight with gang members over nothing i was never convinced that he did want to go straight as there was nothing stopping him pursuing an education or a trade in fact it would have been a breath of fresh air if he had of gone straight and we had a character who turned his life around instead he spends his time helping his friend trying to commit murder i felt no sympathy when he is predictably shot by another teen at the end of the film which is sad because at the beginning of the film i really liked the entire family and their desire for success i believe the makers missed a great chance to show the world that success belongs to those who are willing to really strive for it like the pursuit of happiness   i know the purpose of this film was to try and paint a realistic picture of what life is like for black teens living in working class areas of britain but dont we already have enough films in the uk with that very same plot isnt it time these talented producers and writers give britains youth something to aspire to and show them a better life is just around the corner  i applaud the makers of bullet boy for not loading the film full of mindless violence in order to try and get success through shock factors like kidulthood football factory but at the same time this movie offers nothing new to a long list of british films that are effectively dull and depressing to watch there is no happy ending to this movie or any of the others i have mentioned,negative,0
i saw this movie with very low expectations i didnt know a lot about it so i wasnt sure if it was going to be worth it  the story did an ok job of getting you curious about these ruins they travel to the suspense continues when the mayans show up and force them to stay at the ruins  then the movie turns from somewhat suspenseful to pointless the amount of gore found in this movie did not balance out compared to whether it was truly necessary or used more for shock value  the fact that they didnt make any attempt to fight the vines from hell they had fire and didnt try to burn it nor did they try to cut it with a knife to see if they could destroy it or not they quickly jumped into a victim role and their helpless attitude was not real it reminded me of the old horror movies where the people just scream and yell and dont have half a brain to try to fight back,negative,0
im a fan of judy garland vincente minnelli and gene kelly but this movie just left me cold i was expecting another american in paris from minnelli so perhaps i was expecting too much  the movie was short on songs and short of impressive dance numbers i was impressed by the very expressionistic kelly dance as mococo on the ship i was also impressed by the nicholas brothers in be a clown too bad the song was so annoying i also enjoyed judy attacking kelly with bricabrac check lorna lufts autobiography for some interesting information on that scene  actually the movie has what must be some of cole porters most annoying songs especially nina also judy and gene yell constantly like screechy children  the plot is thinwhich is par for the course for musicalsbut it is not saved by impressive dance numbers or by memorable songs i suspect the best parts of this movie were left on the cutting room floor please some movie restorer find those bits of film and show us what the movie could have been,negative,0
it takes a while to get adjusted to the sound of sons of the pioneers  but then you thoroughly enjoy it if the soundtrack would be played by an orchestra like max steiner or dmitri tiomkin it would lose its folkloric character the music conducts the film everything seems to follow its rhythm the whole cast is excellent ben johnson and harry carey jr are the young men guiding the caravan ward bond is the mormon leader and joanne dru is a flirting actress ford was able to make of what would be an ordinary western something totally different and original showing us the music the dances and most of all the people,positive,1
you could tell from the opening shot of the conveyor belt in the bank that this was going to be a great film  a touch minimalist in feel with a twist of retro this film oozes style the brilliant camerawork acting script and the manner that the secret life of the protagonist unfolds all complement each other in possibly making the best italian film ive ever seen up there with la stanza del figlio  albeit different  shame on the people sitting behind me who made it obvious that they couldnt see the relevance of the slow but painfully beautiful scenes meticulously crafted by the camera dont miss,positive,1
i am a member of a canoeing club and i can tell you the truth that deliverance is synonomous with the peacefulness and tranquility of the experience as we put our boats into the water banjoes echo in the back of the conscious mind this movie is timeless because it waxes philosophical of humans place in nature and technologys effect upon mans relationship with nature we see it in the bow fishing we see it in the home made tent there is also city mans disdain and feeling of superiority to the rural woodsman cracker the fact that the banker from atlanta ned beatty has bad teeth is meant to put him on the same level with the woodsmen who also have bad teeth ultimately the struggle of life and death supersedes civilized mans suppositives about the law this canoe trip ends too soon for the viewer but alas not soon enough for the characters,positive,1
the only reason i rented this was because of the article in fangoria magazine the article made this film look interesting well it isnt this was a very boring amateurishly written and directed movie all the actors in this movie are awful except faye dunaway who is always a joy to watch but too much time was focused on gina phillips and her ridiculous encounters with ravens and duilio marzio marzio has such a thick argentinean accent you can only understand every couple of words he says also on hand is nicholas pauls who plays the ultrabland love interest to gina phillips the bottom line this movie is not scary there is only one good scene and that is the last five to ten minutes of the movie i would have given this one star but i gave it three just because i like faye dunaway so much but even she wasnt that great in this,negative,0
i think this is one of burts top five movies along with deliverance smokey and the bandit boogie nights and city heat he also directed this one so he had a talent for that too like his buddy clint eastwood i wish he made more films like this or even a sequel to sharkys machine than the likes of stroker ace or cannonball run ii this is a tough gritty cop thriller with reynolds at the top of his game having the beautiful rachel ward in it of thorn birds fame helped too henry silva is the bad guy and he always does a good job at that the film also a great soundtrack too i highly recommend this wish it was on dvd in the uk an audio commentary from reynolds would be great as well 710,positive,1
the title song for this movie is the greatest free spirited ballad ever written           i first saw this movie back in 197879 when i first subscribed to cable in 1979 cable was just starting to become common place in homes or at least that when it was becoming common here in missouri  this might very well be the first movie i ever watched on the pay channel called the movie channel  which was called the star channel back then they changed the name to the movie channel in the early 1980si received a free month of the star channel with my new cable subscription the van was one of the movies that was in heavy rotation on that network at that time  i remember watching this movie back then and thinking it was a typical teen flickalong the same lines as other medium budget teen flicks the ones where the plot revolves around nudity and parties  i totally forgot that this movie even existed until i recently seen this movie again after having not seeing it for decades i found a copy of it on dvd for sale in cheap bin i recognized it and bought it for a mere 499  seems like i had remembered this film being much better that it wasis however watching it back then was a different experience than watching now30 years later  it was fun to see the kids listing to rock n roll music smoking weed and having sex in the back a fancy vanoften all at the same time this is what a good teen party movie should be  there isnt much of a plot other than the fact that the main character fantasizes about having sex with his arch rivals good looking girlfriend he blows all of his college savings money to purchase a tricked out dodge vanwith shag carpet walls  mirrored ceiling and a water bed in itto get her attention and he eventually gets to have sex with her but his arch rival finds out and comes looking for him so that the two of them can settle their differences by drag racing their vanshe and his arch rival end up wrecking both of their vans and instead of stealing away his arch rivals girlfriend he wins over the heart of a preppylesser attractive girl that he halfass dates through most of the movie and he decides he is happierbetter off and the movie ends  the movie does have its funny moments but watching this movie 30 years later it becomes more of a trip down memory lane because i still can remember pizza parlors pinball arcades it also brought back memories of cruising around a small town while we smoked pot as we would yell at good looking girls and hoping to get laid sometimes id get lucky and get some decent looking girl to share a joint with me and wed screw in the backseat afterwords i also remember many of the songs in this movewhen they were newthis movie serves as a perfect time capsule for that era in those regards brought back lots of memories  the one thing that is depicted in this movie that i honestly can not remember is i never remember a time when full sized vans were as popular as this film depicts them as being i remember that era very well and i dont young men going around wishing they had a van instead i remember young men in the 70s self included wanting a pontiac trans am chevy camaro or a hot rod ford mustang but never a van this movie makes it appear as if vans were most popular item going and that every young man wanted onewhich just wasnt true of that era,negative,0
acting is horrible this film makes fast and furious look like an academy award winning film they throw a few boobs and butts in there to try and keep you interested despite the extremely weak and far fetched story there is a reason why people on the internet arent even downloading this movie this movie sunk like an iron turd do not waste your time renting or even downloading it this film is and always will be a permaturd i am now dumber for having watched it in fact this title should be referred to as a permaturd from now on calling it a film is a travesty and insult abhorrent abominable appalling awful beastly cruel detestable disagreeable disgusting dreadful eerie execrable fairy fearful frightful ghastly grim grisly gruesome heinous hideous horrendous horrid loathsome lousy lurid mean nasty obnoxious offensive repellent repulsive revolting scandalous scary shameful shocking sickie terrible terrifying ungodly unholy unkind,negative,0
after too many bad memories i took to skipping this episode each time it showed up in the season 2 sequence i recently watched it again just to remind me why ive always considered this the worst sttng episode with the exception of shades of gray which barely counts as an episode at all  i keep listening to the clunky dialogue and thinking of the script redpenciled by the authors writing 101 teacher show dont tell from deanna trois pronouncement and everyone elses constant elbowing reminders about what a charming dangerous rogue okona is to guinans explanation about how funny her droid joke is it isnt to the whocares resolution to the conflict there isnt a plot point that isnt highlighted and tripleunderlined for our edification and there aint a believable moment in any of it unfortunately bill campbell a charming actor in other circumstances is too puppydog huggable to be the center of the machinations of the plot on the other hand it could be that no one short of john barrowman jack harkness from doctor who could pull of this underwritten placeholder of a role  zero points by the way to the data subplot while i think joe piscopo stopped being funny decades ago he and brent spiner had nothing to work with here although the jerry lewis bit was funny in a stupid way  on a good day you may be able to think of this as a charming little homage to a lesser original series episode me id rather skip ahead to time squared or q who,negative,0
i normally finish every movie or book i start even if theyre poor just cause i hate giving up on them this was so poorly made i was in disbelief  im not just looking for spielberg magic  i rent foreign films and i rent really old scifis most recently soylent green  worth the rent i like both hollywood action and slower moving character development different films need to be approached differently to be appreciated i could find no redeeming element to this one the action was so wooden i wasnt the least bit on edge the character development was virtually absent  youre not left feeling sorry for anyone or even identifying with them finally there were so many pieces that just didnt add up  dont waste your time  better to watch paint dry,negative,0
people need to give this show a chance the people who write bad reviews there are very few of them are clearly people who havent seen many episodes one needs to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it all of the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws they make mistakes but they are realistic mistakes which is an uncommon thing to see on television today also for the most part the acting is superb lauren graham has been snubbed of an emmy for six years now someone needs to give this woman the credit she deserves same goes for kelly bishop who plays emily gilmore so perfectly also its nice to see a show that can have a young girl at the center of it and not be filled with teen angst rory is a smart girl which is also not seen a lot on television today if only other shows could capture the wholeness of this show,positive,1

the only redeeming quality of this film is the actual storylineotherwise this movie was terrible the acting was ridiculously bad and the set design was cheesy and very tacky the story was decent but it was very hard to watch due to all the horrid acting i wouldnt recommend watching this onethe only redeeming quality of this film was that the actors were somewhat attractiveespecially ryan bauer the man who plays the soap opera star some of the editing was well done but there are continuity errors all over the placeim just starting to get sick and tired of watching gay movies that are badcan we get a good one soon,negative,0
i enjoyed the mr magoo cartoons i saw while growing up and i enjoy leslie nielsons comic skills so i thought this marriage must produce a funny child  i couldnt have been more wrong  this movie was just awful i dont recall a single funny moment this is one of the two or three times in hundreds of films over the years ive wanted my money back you will leave this film dejected because you wont ever have that time back to use in a better way in a comedy the plot must draw in the viewer and serve as a framework for gags this plot does neither it just kinda lies there gasping like a beached fish,negative,0
blade runner deckard is a replicant   city of lost children augmented senses or whatever used and abused and mostly well just giving us far less than what we might dream of and  dark city   these really ought to be added  for a while now ive been waiting for an animated film that might affect me as much as miyazakis stuff has this one is the 1st  hmm scratch the animated part of that  i have an intense lovehate relationship with film noir and hey if you dont leave it must be mostly love right but there are so many scifi and noir themes totally submerged in this film that its just a wonder to watch  these people did an incredible job,positive,1
anyone familiar with horror films knows that most of them are not scary at all some people enjoy gorefests with subpar story lines and character development i personally enjoy horror films that focus on atmosphere and interesting concepts eg a tale of two sisters kairo etc whatever the type of horror film one personally likes there are only a select few that really scare you noroi is one of them  this is a documentarystyle movie which means that the entire film is a compilation of video clips that are linked by the legend of a demonic entity named kagutaba the premise is that a journalist filmed his own footage by interviewing people associated with the demonic rituals associated with kagutaba then compiled footage from other sources that link with his research what results is a relentlessly chilling experience that feels very real and very disturbing despite the fact that the story itself is fake  some have compared noroi with the blair witch project but the only similarity is the documentary style one obvious difference between the films is that noroi scares the viewer by linking events to one another using different sources for example the journalist records the exterior of a house that he is researching and sees something strange on the porch later in the film a clip from another characters home video introduces that very same strange occurrence the viewers memory links the two incidents and chills start running down their spine another example involves a television show with a child psychic who answers every single question correctly except for one in fact her answer is so wrong that the viewer may wonder what the filmmakers were thinking later on however that wrong answer turns out to be linked to an extremely disturbing event this is intelligent filmmaking indeed  another difference between noroi and blair witch is that noroi provides not one but two very long finales the second of which is placed a minute after the credits start to roll and is the single greatest scare scene in the history of horror cinema i do not say such things lightly it totally wrecked me in a wonderous way  other aspects of filmmaking are well done the legend and ritualistic background of kagutaba are very interesting and most of the actors did a good job the only overthetop performance comes from a guy whos supposed to be crazy anyway so thats expected the cinematography is intentionally gritty because all of the footage is supposed to represent videos shot on camcorders japanese films are not known for their special effects but the effects used here were awesome in some cases they create an otherworldly feel eg the static interference or the first finale but in other cases they are alarmingly realistic eg the second finale  when all is said and done noroi goes down as the scariest film ive ever seen i would go so far as to say that there is no film in existence that provides such sheer terror from beginning to end like noroi does see it now,positive,1
minor spoilers  you know its getting to the point where walt disney television animation might just as well be called walt disney sequel animation these sequels range from excellent beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas and the fantastic lion king ii simbas pride to horrible the return of jafar this is of course my personal opinion now disney brings us their latest sequel scamps adventure and while it is flawed it is still entertaining  the quality of animation is not up to par with disney feature animation still the animators do a good job of bringing the characters to life lady and tramp have not aged a day since 1955 trusty still talks about his sense of smell and ol reliable and jock still gives him grief about it theres a nice fight between tramp and a huge dog in the dog pound and once again we are treated to a spaghetti dinner with the two romantic leads though it is highly doubtful that this will become a classic scene like its predecessor  i really dont care for most of the songs though roger bart and susan eganthe singing voices of scamp and angelsing their parts very nicely both melissa manchester and norman gimbel have done much better work in the past danny troobs score is okay but nothing memorable and some of the junkyard gang seem like excess baggage that is they really dont do much  the voice work on the other hand is quite good while i dont like jeff bennett as the dogcatcher he is very good as tramp chazz palminteri does a nice job as buster leader of the junkyard gang and alyssa milano gives what may be her best performance as angel then there is scamp who is the spitting image of his dad he is voiced to perfection by scott wolf wolf does a superb job of showing scamps wild streak and his soft side  all in all while scamps adventure is flawed it still makes for rather entertaining viewing it is my hope however that walt disney television animation will turn their attention to more original material for their future releases  ,positive,1

id like to start by saying i would not go see this movie again if they were giving out popcorn made of solid gold and the ticket granted me eternal life this movie was terrible i cant give this it a truly honest rating because there are no negative stars the acting is absolutely terrible this movie is a travesty based on the classic the most dangerous game if you really want to torture yourself for 90 minutes rent something like gigli at least jlo provides some better scenery ben should pacify the ladies viewing it im not upset about the 7 i paid to see the move id just like the 90 minutes of my life back  can you give me my time back samuel l jackson changing lanes,negative,0
when plague breaks out in new orleans its richard widmark to the rescue in panic in the streets one of the lessercelebrated films of the great elia kazan kazan keeps the pace brisk and there are lots of marvelous touches  the scenes between widmark and barbara bel geddes who plays his wife and the scene in the police station show family life and work life and the relationships of average citizens which is in sharp contrast to the lives and relationships of the lowlifes portrayed by a menacing jack palance his weak yes man zero mostel tommy cook and louis charles there are also some interesting visuals  palance has a couple of scenes with actors who seem to come up to his knees in height  the acting is marvelous and the dialogue sharp if the story isnt quite up to the direction and performances it has a few questionable aspects which will be spotted by the viewer quite easily that aside its well worth viewing kazan was a masterful director,positive,1
when i bought this dvd i though it seems to be a nice light comedy about love and relationships made up in portuguese standards lets give it a chance i was totally wrong what a disappointing movie first its not a comedy its a cheap drama which can be so melodramatic that its even worse than many portuguese soap operas second the plot is so boring and leads nowhere it has no structure it just flows like the wind in one or another direction the production is also bad the sound mixing is horrible because sometimes the voices are disconnected it made me remind some old portuguese movies from the 80s the acting should have been better too well to sum up its not with films like this one that portuguese cinema will improve in fact it was one of the worst portuguese movies i have seen in the last years bad argument bad acting bad production i had no high hopes for this movie but it was much worse than ive ever imagined just forget about it,negative,0

a very early oliver stone associateproduced film and one of the first films in the impressive career of lloyd kaufman cofounder and president of the worlds only real independent film studio troma creator of the toxic avenger and at the prestigious amsterdam fantastic filmfestival lifetimeachievement awarded filmmaker for over 30 years having raised the money for this film on his own lloyd wrote this script together with theodore gershuni in 1970 and in hindsight regrets having listened to advice to have gershuni else direct the film instead of doing it himself but back then he was still inexperienced in the business and it is probably because of decisions like these that he takes no nonsense from anyone anymore indeed it would have been interesting to see lloyds version of his own script  as one of the worlds most original daring experimental and noncompromising directors he probably would have given it even more edge than it already has but as it is we have the gershunidirected film and weather it is due to the strong script or the fact that he too is indeed quite a director of his own sugar cookies is a very intelligent highly suspenseful and wellcrafted motion picture that deserves a lot more attention than it receives the shoestring budget the small studio this was even before kaufman and his friend and partner for over 30 years now michael herz formed troma had to work with is so well handled that the film looks a lot more expensive indeed does not have a low budget look at all the story revolves around lesbian camilla stone played by enigmatic mary woronow and her lover who winds up dead through circumstances i wont reveal not to spoil a delightful story this leads to a succession of plottwists mind games and personality reform that is loosely inspired by hitchcocks vertigo and at least as inventive the atmosphere is a lot grimmer though and some comparisons to nicholas roegs and donald cammells performance come to mind in this mix is a very original and inventive erotic laden thriller that keeps it quite unclear as to how it is all going to end which along with a splendidly interwoven subplot with a nod to kaufmans earlier and unfortunately unavailable big guss whats the fuss makes for a very exciting oneandahalfhour certainly one of the best films in tromas library and yet again one of those films that defy the curious fantasy that their catalog is one of bad taste the dvd includes some recent interviews kaufman conducts with woronov and the other leading lady lynn lowry later seen in george romeros the crazies thus giving some interesting insight in what went on during the making of this cultfavorite and a few hints of what would be different had lloyd directed it himself highly recommended,positive,1
this movie was banned in england why tom savini george romero dario argento lucio fulci and others had done far worse before and have continued to so since  this movie has all the basic elements of a decent 70s or early 80s horror film good looking girls who cant act to save their lives by the way a terrible lightning storm with a torrential downpour a scythe a crazy brother wandering around the family estate and actually a pretty damn good twist at the end but banned seriously when the english parliament banned this movie the italians probably laughed their collective asses off at how backwards and prudish the brits really were  there was maybe two minutes of total screen time devoted to the violence and gore which was greatly underdone there was nudity but no sex although allusions to sex were made obviously but absolutely nothing worthy of being banned  i would like to see what could have been done if the filmmakers had a decent budget to work with as it stands the film is entertaining but the lack of picture and sound quality take away from the end result  banned what a joke,negative,0
jeanmarc barr being light the big blue dogville has directed and interpreted this strange movie which is the second installment of some kind of trilogy i might be wrong but i dont think this movies part of the dogma 95 manifesto though it really looks like it im not really sure of what i think about this film all actors are good they deliver pretty good performances especially rosanna arquette and jeanmarc barr the story is somehow interesting but i dont know theres something about the movie that i dont like the sex scenes are way too long it goes from an interesting work of art to an erotic piece of crap i dont know exactly where it stands sure its not a bad movie but i wont suggest people to see it neither ill tell them not to watch just do as you want if you feel curious and youre openminded give it a try you might like it,negative,0

i saw this movie a few months ago in the town which appeared as greendale in the movie which is the only reason i went to see it another local who was there just forwarded to me an email announcement of a repeat showing because the first had sold out and people were turned away his editorial comment in his forward is a good summary  yuk  unless youre a neil young fan or live innear greendale if the latter you know the real name skip this movie its mostly an ego trip for the filmmaker it has no discernible plot the music is merely ok and too much of the lyrics are unintelligible making it impossible to follow what little shreds of plot there may be  i dont need to put in a spoiler warning because there are no surprises to give away  id give this a 1510 but thats just for the amusement value of seeing the locales made into a movie it wasnt worth the 6 i could rent a video camera and drive around greendale and make a better movie myself  if you want to see a good environmentalmessage movie with no plot go rent koyaanisqatsi,negative,0
even if one didnt realize that sellers was in poor health at the time of filming and passed away before the films release the fiendish plot of dr fu manchu would be painful viewing it is supposedly a lampoon of sax rohmers famous oriental villain but it lacks any focus the potential for satirical commentary on the antioriental overtones of rohmers concept are ignored indeed the movie employs racist insults there are hardly any actual jokes or gags just mostly actors behaving idiotically and spouting dreary lines it is especially distressing to see sid caesar forced to spout curses and racial slurs for attempted laughs most of the other actors embarrass themselves as well  and then theres peter sellers he plays the dual roles of the sinister fu manchu who is trying to concoct a formula to regain his youth and his stalwart british foe nayland smith sellers isnt one hundred per cent bad he conveys a quirky warmth as smith when he discusses his fetishistic attachment to his lawn mower and hes oddly moving as manchu when he expresses his love for english music hall entertainment but most of the time he plays both roles with a weary grimness thus further sabotaging any comical possibilities sellers routines where he revitalizes his fading strength with electric shocks are particularly excruciating he seems too convincingly agonized to be funny   a few genuinely witty lines an apt slapstick bit by burt kwouk cato in the pink panther films as one of manchus minions and helen mirrens amusing musical numbers cannot salvage this mess if anyone wants to understand why peter sellers is considered a comedic genius they wont learn anything from the fiendish plot of dr fu manchu,negative,0
its a shame theres an interesting idea here but it gets completely lost in a confusion of commodore 64 style computer effects and bad storytelling the plot such as it is concerns a bounty hunter of souls it should be a fairly straightforward hunterhunted kind of story but the director andor the writer seem like they forgot what the movie was supposed to be when they were about three days into shooting things arent helped by the fact that the main baddie looks like hes wearing a cheap darth maul mask which they tried to disguise with flowing cg colors not much to recommend here even the title seems to propel it into obscurity,negative,0
this is one of my all time favourite movies if ur not into cars then forget it this movie features 1 of aussies greatest muscle cars the xygtho yeah so the acting not the greatest  it was never made to win an oscar the car action will keep you comin back for more and more there is a cool collection of muscle cars from the 70s and an awesome 57 chev  with a real cool cat drivin it also there is a really cool song sung by terry serio the main actor the acting is pretty funny when taken lightly but the tyre smokin and drag racing is the main focus in this movie big fast cars with pleantly of steelno plastic cars and some cool street dragging i recommend it only to people that are into cars and not someone looking for great acting,positive,1
this short subject is a remake of the three stooges 1942 film whats the matador about the boys trip to mexico and their bullfighting adventures although the original short was made during the stooges peak period it isnt that memorable and i believe it is one of the more mediocre films with curly howard  having established that i believe that sappy bullfighters is just pathetically awful like all the other shorts with joe besser moe and larry never should have hired besser because his whiny almost feminine character was completely wrong for the violent comedy of the stooges his 16 films with moe and larry marked the nadir for the team and those shorts are embarrassing to watch this short was released in 1959 and was the teams swan song with columbia maybe besser was a nice guy but he was all wrong as the third stooge  i wont review any more besser shorts because i would just be giving the same scathingly negative review over and over do yourself a big favor and dont watch this instead try to catch in the sweet pie and pie or hoi polloi,negative,0

michael williams who works for bbc finds a somehow impressive italian picture which gets mixed in the material of his ongoing task titled diabolical art a documentary but since his wifes mysterious death her daughter emily has been emotionally disturbed so he goes spoleto where the problematic picture is with her and her nanny jill and there is a countess who is also a psychic and she informs him that the picture was somehow made at the night that a young witch named emilia was executed michael doesnt believe her story but after that emily has hysterical spasm and jill is killed this italian film is of course almost innocently influenced by the exorcist but this one is much cheaper much simplerand in a sense much dirtier first of all it should be said this film is full of confusion for instance the story shows emily is a reincarnation of emilia but when emily sees her in the flashbacks she perceives her exclusively from a thirdpersons point of view but if she is the reincarnation of emilia she should and must see the past from nothing but emilias point of view confusions of this kind which the film has many are almost exclusively based upon a problematic fact that the film is too cowardly rather than ambivalent to specify its own quasifreudian theme namely preadolescent girls oneway incestuous wish to make matters worse this film also has characteristic problem if not confusion every character is too naive and helpless to be realistic andor believable living human regarding emily or emilia she is after all a child and one can say it is difficult to blame her mainly for her naiveness and helplessness and according to the freudian theory every girl wants to have her fathers children in her own way in this sense emily is not exclusively pathological only her way of excluding other women from her fathers love is problematically pathological but as i already mentioned this film per se is too cowardly to be freudian the problem is that adult characters are as childish and naive and helpless as emily is and because of this characteristic weakness even the psychic who can see almost everything cannot do anything downtoearth and because of the same weakness the very story of the film is ended in a badly escapist way in addition special effects of this film are incredibly cheap and laughable although stelvio ciprianis music is noteworthily beautiful indeed this one is so good that it seems to be worth having it alone the film as a whole is nothing but a cheap bfilm which can disappoint even the 1970sitalian horrorfilmlovers,negative,0
this is obviously aimed at the same market as monsters inc and shrek but is different in its less cartoony feel despite the deliberately cartoony characteristics of the lead creatures the story is not one that had a massive in your face moral at the end its more like its tugging at your shirt sleeves but chooses just to tell a story about relationships between different animals you know the outcome but you cant help being drawn in   the characters themselves are far more than their voices the advantage of less famous actors doing the voices unlike most disney movies they are well rounded and completely believable strangely the group dynamics are brilliantly well presented and the character revelations and quirks are subtle and enjoyable you will find yourself rooting for them far sooner than you would like to think   the animation is brilliant as you would expect and you will be praying for the opportunity to go on the ice slide in the movie you will fall in love with the characters especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and its desperate attempts to bury its nuts i came out wanting the obligatory merchandise especially the sloth toy only to be disappointed the next day when i couldnt find anything vaguely related  which strangely makes the movie all the more pure   better than monsters inc or shrek,positive,1
i will not vote this movie as an awful one mainly because i kind of like it i was one of those summer days that i was so lame to do anything and decided do rent a movie in the stupid section of the videostore besides that i didnt slept in the nigh before and the movie got me awakelets just start the autopsy ok the movie haves a strange plot first is isolation there is an expedition they get isolated in an island because there is no gas on the boat something like that there is not a single convincing performance on the actors partso far the main problem starts after the isolation idea the pov of a snake then another then another then snakes that change then false spooks a lot of them and when we believe the movie is going on a good way for a b flick keeping the suspense it fails because after ten or eleven spooks we dont get carried away the one scene that unmistifies all is the scene when we witness a drunk lesbian show watched by snakes that seem to dance after this its becoming not a horroradventure but a comedy driven movie the adventure part is discarded also  for me the problem in a movie is the third act it is the one section that just drives the movie for a already guessed conclusion or if it succeeds we dont noticed it like a ninja smoke in our eyes wellsnake island haves a bad conclusion it all comes to a «by the book» ending with a confront persecution and escape sequence it was predictable in the moment i rented the dam copy the other real problem is concept concept is very important it is the reason you believe in dinosaurs coming to life or a corpse full of stitches that just wants to live the main concept about snakes that want revenge after decades on torture by the human civilization wellhmmm just doesent glues on the wall one thing you will enjoy if you watch it with an opened mind is the more bz sequences naked lesbian girls some amateur camera angles the braindead homage with the grass cutter the black dude doesent die first and thats all if you want to see snakes black dudes and comedy and you prefer bigger budgets go and see «snakes on a plane»  hasta moviegoers,negative,0
larry bishop the writeractordirector focuses too heavily on the camera music and visuals the film resorts to meaningless ramblings and vulgar monologues which seem to have no purpose other than boring and irritating the audience the actors experience a bumpy ride from the films start to finish and are caught in one terrible smoke screen the hell with the ride the film is a bomb  the victors are presented as weathered vigilantes who seek their own form of justice for what they see as lawlessness they are bikers antiheroes and protagonists pistolero played by larry bishop is the revengeful leader of the pack the gent michael madsen is trapped in his own crossfire of chaos and psychosis   comanche eric balfour is loyal but mysterious deuce performed by david carradine should have passed on the ride and so should the ticketbuyers if you decide to see the film youll be sorry but youll find out why billy wings vinnie jones is a lewd and venomous character completely filled with disdain  what puzzles me is how this film with all of its continual ramblings and vulgarity ever got anybody to invest in a ride that absolutely goes nowhere ticketbuyers take my advice dont pay for the ride please dont make the same mistake as the investors  the first fifteen minutes or so of the movie is confusing and unintelligible the dialog which rapidly turn into meaningless monologues doesnt make any sense the entire film is hell bent on going nowhere poor dennis hopper is caught in the middle of a real mess he too should have passed on the ride there are decapitated heads slashed throats and nude females wrestling it is clear that bishop doesnt know where he is going with the film he gets entirely lost but by the end of the ride you just wont give a damn mama mia stay home and by all means dont take the ride i rate this film a 1 out of 10 but this movie is so awful it deserves a zero,negative,0

this is a voice of a person who just finished watching the second season of rome almost at one go and grabbed the opportunity to see what happened next  this film conveniently takes off where rome ends if you find rome an abomination a foul mouthed screwfest of little historical accuracy then you might enjoy imperium augustus but if you feel rome is a good thing if you enjoy the complicated intrigue the ambiance of decadence and the work of the actors then imperium will obviously appear to you as an overly timid superfluous and tedious soap opera with not many redeeming factors  there are some actors who for my taste look somewhat better than these in rome i especially disliked romes image of cleopatra as a drugsoaked sex addict there must have been a great deal of strength and dignity in that woman and the actress in imperium suits the part much better otoole and rampling are good and so are some others but then if you have come to know  and love  atia as the super cool bitch youll find the depiction of her in imperium  as a tearjerking mother goose in an apron  absolutely ridiculous there are supposed to be some bitchy characters in imperium but these actresses rely heavily upon staring at the men and nothing much more youll find no interesting female characters in this epic theres also the painfully comic maecenas whom we see as a screeching drag queen even though there is little historical evidence that he was such hes once referred to as being effeminate in his pleasures in the annals  the interiors are rather meager and rely on clichés upon clichés cleopatras big hall looks like something out of a computer game or a childrens play room in an egyptian theme park theres a looooooooot of really poor 3d graphics not up to 2003 standards  the action is presented as a series of flashbacks the aged augustus is reliving so we get a quick look at some historical events some of which are presented well whereas some are not an disproportional amount of time is wasted to show livia as the eternal flame of augustus this affair doesnt sizzle for even a moment the dialog is superlame and everything is seasoned with tacky tearinducing musical score whatever amount of reality the show aims to capture every last shred of it is destroyed by the dry synchronized dubbing most of the actors are non english speakers  everything is lukewarm in this epic true there are more historical accuracies than in rome but dramatically speaking its plain boring the characters lack depth and the dialog sharpness camerawork is often reduced to static shots and lighting offers nothing to please your eye  theres really noone to love and noone to hate in imperium regardless of whether you liked or disliked rome there are much better films and miniseries around ancient rome the rise and fall of an empire would be one thing i recommend,negative,0
i dont care what anyone else says this movie is the worst piece of trash committed on film what was john landis thinking  i know its based on a series of childrens books but cmon even kids hate this movie its pointless and boring tom arnold once again amply demonstrates that his only talent is wasting production money  i think the only reason the stupids hasnt appeared on the 100 worst films of all time is that only 20 or so people will admit to watching this garbage at least hobgoblins made it on mst3k,negative,0
here you see mr eastwood in all of his glory ie at the top of his form as an actor and at the height of his physical appeal but the ladies depicted are hardly typical of the south then or now the young girls at the boarding school are incredibly naive some showing signs of developing into really depraved women and geraldine page fullblown in her corruption hardly represents the mean when it comes to head mistresses of girls schools either then or now that is not to say that there isnt the occasional bad apple in any barrel mr eastwood has said this is one of his own two favorite films  the beguiled does have an original plot a lot of attractive characters and many surprises in store for the viewer its thoroughly engrossing and entertaining but not really realistic i know having grown up in the south and attended a girls school and college moreover i have been acquainted with innumerable girls who did the same not to mention their laidback teachers or you might even say repressed professors who were a far cry from the headmistress depicted here she is downright comical in her depiction of a southern gentle woman who is not quite what she seems  this movie was a little outrageous when it first appeared and still is i think but you wont be sorry you spent your time watching it,positive,1
mojo is a story of fifties london a world of budding rock stars violence and forced homosexuality mojo uses a technique for shooting the 1950s often seen in films that stresses the physical differences to our own time but also represents dialogue in a highly exaggerated fashion owing much to the way that speech was represented in films made in that period i have no idea if people actually spoke like this outside of the movies but no films made today and set in contemporary times use such stylised language its as if the stilted discourse of 1950s screenwriters serves a common shorthand for a past that seems in consequence a very distant country indeed and therefore stresses the particular rather than the universal in the story mojo features a strong performance from ian hart and annoying ones from aiden gillan and ewan bremner the latter still struggling to build a posttrainspotting career but feels like a period piece a modern film incomprehensibly structured in an outdated idiom rather dull actually,negative,0
remember the wooden undramatic literary adaptations of the 1970s at their worst you will when you see this broadly acted unintentionally hilarious piece of chocolatebox adaptation most culpable of all is catherine zj who while undeniably easy on the eye substitutes swishing a big dress and looking sultry for actually turning in a performance played pofaced like a melodrama or cold comfort farm without the jokes this effort is not helped by a scriptwriter with a tin ear for dialogue who misses entirely the novels sense of irony or tragedy a shame given the quality of the acting talent on offer  joan plowright claire skinner steven macintosh all deserve better than this,negative,0
why remake the original assault to my mind assault was carpenters true masterpiece it had all the elements good carpenter movies contain external threat on a small group of individuals people taking the challenge because they are forced to do so isolation just remember the guns in carpenters original made no sound being thus a lot more threatening than conventional devices and now this remake concentrating on main character is psychology and on his relation to main character ii the evil but honorable the anonymous threat in the carpenter movie replaced by a rather conventional conspiracycorruption background the remakers just didnt understand the main plot of the original and thus produced something pretty ordinary,negative,0
this is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest in many ways its like a 50s version of valley of the dollswith much of the excesses and sleaziness of valley polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959 like this later film both are about three young ladies who are on the fasttrack to successthough this time its in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry though one of the ladies in the best of everything does have aspirations of broadway  the film begins with hope lange coming into the company for her first day of work shes assigned to toughasnails boss joan crawford who is appearing in her first supporting role in decades despite how nasty crawford seems lange is determined not to give into make it in this job and over time she quickly moves up the ranks from secretary to editor at the same time her two new roommates also try to move up the ranksone through the stage and one through a relationship with a rich playboy like valley of the dolls all of them have their ups and downs mostly downs but by the end of the film there is some hope that at least some of them will make itbattered and bruised nevertheless  in this film men are mostly pigs the only guy who seems decent is played by stephen boyd so naturally hope lange neglects him for a neer do well exboyfriend as for the guys played by veteran character actor brian ahern and the rest they are sexist scum and eventually you understand how crawford became so bitter and nasty  this film has it alladultery premarital sex abortion etc and is certainly not an artistic triumph however thanks to excellent production values and a juicy script this one is a joy to watch just dont expect shakespeare,positive,1
one of the things that i like about pt anderson is that he has the guts to take talent that most people push to the side or have pushed to the side and makes them stars case in point a washedup burt reynolds delivers a great performance in this film and if proving adam sander can be a great actor punch drunk love wasnt enough here comes mark whalburg like youve never seen before  i think many people pass up boogie nights cause they are antiporn or just flat out hate the adult industry and cant overlook that aspect of this film but underneath that is a great story about characters losing everything and battle to regain themselves there is a beautiful film and its too bad that enough people see that,positive,1
philip k dickian movie and a decent one for that matter better than the paycheck woo and that abomination called minority report spielberg but lets face it the twisting and cheesing ending was a bit too much for me half way through the movie i already started to fear about such kind of ending and i was regrettably right but that does not mean that the film is not worth its time no not at all first half as already many here have commented is awesome there are some parts where you start to doubt whether the director intended to convey the message that showmanship is highly important thing in the future we will do such kind on corny sf things because we can or is it simply over combining but the paranoia is there and feeling out of joint also good one,negative,0
dirty dancing one of my most favorite movies ive only watched it two times on abc because i havent had the chance to buy it or rent it from blockbuster i had no idea jennifer grey was 27 at the time she made the movie because she was very convincing as a teenager compared to some women in hollywood she has a very flat chest which is why i was fooled so easily about her age so both physically and emotionally grey pulls off playing a teen very well i also loved the dancingwho wouldnt both times ive watched dirty dancing i keep wanting to look up dance classes i also love the soundtrack and i do recognize some of the songs from when i was eight or nine i would love to be able to watch this in my drama class and im going to ask my teacher at some point if theres any part of the movie he can use for educational purposes its much better than the stuff he made us watch last year and the ending was absolutely fantastic thats one of the best moments in the film  i cant believe im looking forward to the first day back to school because of dirty dancing who could ask for a better influence from a movie with that sort of title,positive,1
i think that this film is brilliantthere are many reasons why but these are some of them 1the good acting by tom and tyler 2 brilliant machine gun scene that was a piece of brilliance 3 i thought that the ending was a good twist because i never expected that at the end all credit to sam mendesas well as a these 3 points the film form of the film is good as well i am a film student at college and we studied this film in great detail and it was one of the best films i have seen in many years id just like to say a big thank you to all of the people involved in making this film lastly i would like to say the best scene in the film is the machine gun scene where john rooney gets kill it is just pure brilliance in shooting the scene in silence until john rooney says  im glad its you it is a lot better like that i think because the viewer creates there own sound and that sound is totally different for every viewer just brilliant  thank you for reading this comment written by ross kirk aged 16,positive,1
this movie was a long buildup with no climax people whom refer to the swordfight in the end as great must either be out of their minds or have none way too often this movie got soft i am not saying that soft movies are bad but no matter how fond you are of sugar it should have no space on a tbone steak this movie was supposed to be about vengeance for crimes committed against a culture but it ended up being a petty barbrawl and there was only one of them who actually knew what a sword was tim roths character and yes he plays him well rob roy was a weak hero with no knowledge of how to use a sword and the way he won was a disgrace as a drama this movie had its periods but the best performance in it has to go the nature of scotland this is one tad breath short of being termed as soap in my book,negative,0
ive watched this film a few times and i never really liked it im not a fan so termed nu horror so i cant be dismissed on that account i found it a little sleazy i think the thing that irks me about hammers is the sexploitation aspect not sex mind you but sexploitation im surprised at how many people have rated this film so highly so ill have another look at it but for me it wasnt creepy it had no atmosphere just a bit of omigod look at those badstupid london prostitute women and that little innocent anna about to get raped by yet another nasty man ooherh i suppose ultimately for me the film had no depth whatsoever just a bunch of nasty priggish men and women only there for the titillation value this no doubt was to some degree what victorian england was like but the sets are even too clunky and dull impart a sense of victorian menace roger cormans horrors on the other hand now thats style atmosphere and elegant horror for me this was just exploitative flat footed trash,negative,0
when i first saw this i thought it was a joke all i could think was you get the 8mm camera ill get my little brothers monster toys well make a movie why would anyone in a modern time like 2001 make a scifi movie like this it looks like it was made in the early 80s with actors that are as wooden as a cigar store indian a script that was written by the directors 4yearold son a camera that was stolen from a burning pawn shop povertyrow special effects and to top it off a director that thought making this crap would make them famous the end result wasnt spectacular complete with scrappy dialogue and continuity from venus must have been fun to make and im sure everyone involved had a blast with their silly little movie  a 2 out of 10 for a valiant hopeless effort  ,negative,0
this movie certainly proves that also the good americans can do terribly good propaganda no questions being asked no comments being made on power abuse or police terror when james stewart solid and convincing as always solves all the stories from dillinger to 5th column more or less singlehandedly june allyson as his regular love interest holds up the family values and ej hoover is executive producerand children or non guilty bystanders are never harmed when the professionals execute not to speak of civil rights which are never broken or homes which are never intruded and if the fbi service would not be enough steward also gives his sons life for the country in ww ii perfectly made if you wouldnt know better,negative,0
although at first glance this movie looks like the story of your parents high school life and many people will try to tell you that this movie is way outdated and i admit that that was my first impression but honestlythe lessons that are learned by the heroesheroines are def not outdated who doesnt want to be famous and who doesnt want do be accepted my their peers and the homosexual guyisnt there a whole controversy today about gay marriage blah blah this movie though released in the 80s still addresses some of the biggest issues in todays world this movie does have a little too much profanity and nudity for my taste though thus the 810 rating,positive,1
ive heard a few comments particularly from prisoners of war that changi is not historically accurate and that it is disappointing perhaps it is for those who actually had to live through this stuff and much worse but for the rest of us who really have no idea of how prisoners were treated by the japanese during world war ii changi is a remarkable introduction but changi isnt a war documentary  if it had have been then the historical accuracy aspect would have been paramount it is a miniseries drama with fictional characters and fictional situations though based loosely on actual events ive heard and read about  and at the centre of the story is the ideal of mateship this group of young australian soldiers taken prisoner by the japanese and held in appalling conditions for years became mates through adversity and the strength of their friendships continued throughout their lives after the war it is also a cultural study of the differences between the japanese of the time and the western world with its music games and entertainment in part 5 when it is becoming clear that japan will lose the war after germany has surrendered in europe the japanese prison camp colonel insists that his country must study the culture of their prisoners  in order to defeat a people one must defeat their culture  and to do this one must understand it all in all australia continues its rich tradition of producing exceptional television miniseries and is an unrivalled world leader in this regard vyeing for the afi award with changi is my brother jack the adaptation of george johnstons novel and also a worthy winner miniseries in recent years include day of the roses the story of the investigation into the glanville train crash kings in grass castles the adaptation of mary duracks historical account of her pioneering ancestors kangaroo palace about a group of friends from a country town in australia who travel to london and change and grow apart and the somewhat disappointing adaptation of bryce courtenays powerful novel the potato factory less recently nancy catos sweeping saga of life on the murray  all the rivers run cusack  james brilliant novel about postwar life in sydney  come in spinner colleen mcculloughs outstanding pioneering saga  the thorn birds the river kings ruth parks novel the harp in the south bodyline eureka stockade anzacs etc etc of course there have been some notsogood productions  for instance moby dick do or die on the beach thorn birds the missing years etc generally though if an australian miniseries comes your way make sure you see it  and this goes double for changi a superbly directed masterpiece rating 910,positive,1
the man in the white suit is another feather in the cap of expert scottish director alexander mackendrick whisky galore sweet smell of success the star of the film is alec guinness whose comedies include kind hearts and coronets and the lavender hill mob guiness brings his usual class to the film and makes it much more than a typical comedy  in fact the comedy isnt entirely overt by the end of the picture its nearly become a complete drama its the sort of ealing studio comedy that is calculated not to produce laughter but a sense of general amusement like the best british comedy of the time  the whole idea of the suit isnt very original but the way it is executed is the film is highly original and recommended to any fan of guiness or britsh comedy  76 out of 10,positive,1
i am very disappointed with this movie because i like these french actors and i liked buffet froid from this director bertrand blier but the script of les acteurs is very poor why these actors they agreed to play this poor scenario,negative,0
yes lifetime has a habit of making the male species look stupid and this soap opera aint kidding when they make perry king supposedly a well renowned medical doctor unable to see the evil surrounding him puts your trust in doctors huh how can anyone not see whats going on is he that stupid and the evil wife with a face like a horse goes around killing off his entire family without a trace how does she acquire all the drugs that isnt explained how does she get off being a secretary in a hospital without any credentials i guess the director don fauntleroy asks us to just believe it i didnt i kept yelling at the screen at the stupidity of king with all right in front of his face if the wife was that attractive maybe just maybe id accept it but shes not even that shannon sturges is the perfect wife and i tell you she has the face of a horse i wouldnt cross the street for her yet our perfect husband does and quickly after everybody in the cast get knocked off i wasnt satisfied with the come up pence given to our villainess she deserved more than she got william moses plays the doctors brother who unfortunately you know his outcome from day one pleasure to at least see one pretty face in this clinker that of lesley anne down she gives the film a 2 count just on the relief of seeing someone fetching in this mess perry king deserved his fate what a jerk,negative,0
quit while your ahead is a phrase they never learn typical hollywood sequel scenario if the first film was only shocking the second wasnt expect the third to be the worst thing to hit the screen this year even worse are the prequels events of which were already explained in detail if you havent seen to first two films you will not like this one its like starting to watch lord of the rings or star wars with the last trilogy movie so stand alone this film is not  remember in the first movie about lucians revenge remember the second about the long lost savage brother well if you saw those two 5 min moments and paste them together you would get a 5 min prequel but the creators ether thought these 5 min were vital historical events or just wanted to give a job to some actors cast and crew and maybe make some money in the process i have a loot of money i make movies for a living and im bored what will i do i know ill make a movie so anyway you get this 5 min prequel and you stretch it for 90 min  thats this movie and you know what will happen to the main immortal characters so there is little suspense by the way all the drama of the movie is in those 5 min the only thing that made my eyebrow rise was mom killing in the begging of the movie sick the rest was braveheart remix if you want a comedy see braveheart first then this movie  now im going to rant a bit  the movie put me in the mood who invented the concept of vampire vs werewolf in the first place its older than i am and got old just as fast and why do vampires look like goth girls in heat while werewolves look like psycho bears hiding bad films behind cleavage fails isnt it about time we got some sane slimmer werewolves with an upright posture how can their unchangeable werewolves even breed if they rip everybody into shreds and why with all their powers the vampires didnt rule the world blaa blaa blaa what a waste,negative,0

this is an interesting treatment of a subject that is quite controversial just read the other comments on this film apparently you either love it or hate it and it seems most people make that distinction based on whether they believe the tribulation and end times will happen as portrayed in the movie  basically the film  and its sequels  were made for about 130 each the production values are right down there with plan 9 from outer space and the acting is about on the same level as glen or glenda my apologies to ed wood putting aside the religious message the story is as scary as they come add in even the slightest thought that the story might actually be close to something that might happen in the future and it becomes even scarier  this movie and its sequels didnt try to bring in the reasons why the tribulation happened when it did left behind and the omega code tried to get in everything thief did and to explain all the politics and maneuvering in the middle east leading up to it the net effect was thief did a much better job on the scary part of movie instead of spreading itself too thin trying to explain what was happening in the middle east at the same time   forget the politics and watch this movie and its sequels for what they are  horror stories that they may be horror stories told indirectly by god makes them just that much more frightening if it makes you think about the subject it has done its job  even if you never believe,negative,0
this is yet another pseudointellectual lets make the nazis look real bad movie the nazis were pretty bad no doubt  most of already know that however that does not necessarily make every movie on the theme good a discovery channel presentation of the wannsee conference would have been much more interesting   conspiracy falls on its ass between two categories documentary and drama it doesnt cut it as a documentary the movie is too staged and the presentation too common it doesnt cut it as a drama the characters are too shallow and conflicts too easily solved  another thing is the tagline one of the greatest crimes against humanity was perpetrated in just over an hour as the movie shows the wannsee conference the meeting had nothing to do with reaching a consensus on the final solution the decision on the solution had already been taken by the ss the sole purpose of the meeting was to make all significant stakeholders commit themselves to an already established plan there were no decisions or plans made at the wannsee conference there was only threats and coercion some needed less than others  finally one thing the movie does show although in no exceptional manner is man has a tendency to turn to culture and aesthetics in an attempt to hide for himself the fact that he is committing appalling atrocities this is seen in most powermongering leaders and politicians,negative,0
this movie is terrible terrible one of the worst movies ever i cannot even imagine gigli being worse that this previews made us say no but then looking for something amid the dreck out there right now we decided to go ahead and give it a shot  stupid us  affleck is not an actor hes an image and can look good with explosions but not even the kind bruce willis got in die hard if he stripped his shirt and ran around fighting bad guys it would be a comedy  the best part was catherine ohara  shes always good gandolfini flops again if it werent for the sopranos hed be washed up like he did in the mexican  affleck hogs every scene and as others have said  no character has any motivation whatsoever for their actions   avoid this movie at all costs,negative,0
the long list of big names in this flick including the ubiquitous john mills didnt bowl me over to the extent that i couldnt judge the film on its actual merits it is full of stereotypes caricatures and standard set scenes from the humble airace hero to the loudmouthed yank flyer the music track was such that at one point about an hour before the end i thought the film was over loud rising crescendo grand flourish and finish then silence but then the movie continued i found no real storyline haphazard writing but smartlypressed uniforms and the pretty jean simmons prenose job with a rousing little ditty i cannot say that this picture has any of the ingredients which make a film great i found it maudlin mawkish and minor,negative,0
what can you say when you see a good french movie which tries to draw a suspenseful story in line with the social background of the characters the major point is we believe in those characters and once theyve met each other we want them to stay together its simple and really efficient the background story is less important why does the screenplay go on the side of a halfdeveloped thriller it helps not to get stuck in those social demonstrations most french filmjerkers like to make not too much ambition right sur mes lèvres is only an entertaining french film with good characterization  for all the clever noir points in the screenplay the end is by far too easy it goes quite as easy as in rear window an obvious reference and definitely not a noir film but with a less compelling context where i am amazed its to see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased he brings very little to the story when he appears alone we wonder if weve not missed a part before jacques audiard is not a newcomer yet strange and weird,positive,1
first some background i am english and have lived in london all my life i have been to many games at the den and most other london club grounds i am familiar with the type of person who gets into hooliganism and i know just how they act and how they speak have to say this is a bad bad movie i can tell you that green street is one of the most unrealistic movies i have ever seen i spent most of the movie cringing with embarrassment i felt i should write a mini review because i felt i needed to point out a few things  a people just dont talk like that in london in real life the filmmakers took the whole slang thing too far and made it sound stupid unfortunately hooligan types do exist but those you see in green street are more like parodies b the actor who plays pete dunham charlie hunnam unfortunately sounded about as english or cockney as osama bin laden hes from up north in newcastle and im just amazed any of the other actors could keep straight face acting alongside him  how are we supposed to take him seriously why they didnt just get someone from east london to play that part is beyond me i could have done a bang up job myself hehe c mr frodo i mean how can i be expected to take seriously elijah wood kicking the ass of people twice his size and who are genuinely nasty hooligans hed be dead simple as that honestly as a brit it was hard to watch this film im pretty sure this film will bomb here in the uk it may do a little better in the states because the americans just wont know or care how inaccurate it is   please my american and foreign friends dont believe a word of this nonsense yes these firms do exist but its all extremely underground and hush hush and on a vastly smaller scale the movie only gets a 2 from me because they actually filmed some of it in london usually they try to film these things in cardiff wales or something and expect us all not to notice,negative,0
i liked this movie very much although this movie doesnt boast of big or even known names its very charming its one of those feel good types where you know that everythings gonna be just fine in the end my favorite scene is with the baby elephant part i rate this movie at 75,positive,1
when i bought my toy story tape when it came out to video after being released in theaters i saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of toy story as soon as i saw that i knew this was gonna be a good feature i was right a bugs life like toy story is great story great characters and great animation my favorite characters are dim the rhino beetle voiced by brad garrett and hemlich the caterpillar voiced by the late pixar storyman joe ranft my favorite scene is when slim the walking stick david hyde pierce lifts up hemlich trying to distract the bird and hemlichs like you hoo mr early bird how about a nice tasting worm on a stick and slims like im going to snap im going to snap i just died laughing at that scene being a big fan of insects i think a bugs life is my favorite pixar even though i know a lot of people consider it the worst pixar film ever i dont know how you could hate a pixar film i think theyre all pretty good films good job pixar,positive,1
as an old white housewife i can still appreciate that laurence fishburne is one of our finest actors anyone who appreciates his work like in deep cover might enjoy watching the incredible acting range of this actor since i think this is his directorial debut it might prove even more interesting all of the acting is quite good if you cant take lower manhattan junky worlds or the reality of crime life not glorified action shootem ups then this is not a film you would enjoy it is mr fishburnes usual contribution to incredibly subtle relationships i would love to see larry and anthony hopkins go at each other some day in a movie,positive,1
the color purple is a masterpiece it displays the amazing acting abilities of whoopi goldberg oprah winfrey and danny glover not only is steven spielberg the most incredible director of all time but his versatility shines through in this film if you ever want to see what a movie can do watch this its a beautiful portrayal of one of the most moving stories of all time,positive,1
david webb peoples meets paul andersonif it already sounds weird to you then you are right because it is  peoples is known for his scripts with moral implications of what is right and wrong the value of life etc he covered these issues in bladerunner unforgiven and pretty much in all of his screenplays there is something along those lines  paul andersons first successful movie was a violent thriller not surprisingly so have all of his other movies and here is a violent thriller with moral implications  peoples script is quite apparent in the first half of the movie soldiers trained from birth taught to kill and never had a normal life they are replaced by better genetically engineered soldiers and todd one of the original soldiers is left on a planet and left for dead there he must cope with a group of refugees some want him to stay others hate him and there is an interesting drama here but then  the bullets start to fly as the new soldiers move onto the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all the people big violent loud action ensues and peoples script turns into an anderson actionfest it is hard to believe that the script was originally written that way but the end product is better then i expected entertaining somewhat though admittedly not very thoughtprovoking and exciting once the action starts 710  rated r a lot of violence,positive,1
i also saw this amazingly bad piece of anime at the london scifi festival if you have to watch this thing do so with a large audience preferably after a few beers you may then glean some enjoyment from it   i found the dialogue hilarious lodged in my mind is the introduction of cremator the animation is awful it is badly designed and badly executed it may have been a good idea for the producers to have hired at least one person who was not colour blind  theres nothing else to say really this film is a failure on every level,negative,0
i remember seeing the very first trailer for underdog back last march i also remember at the time smiling to myself ever so slightly sure it was a cheesy idea but i genuinely thought at the time the concept might work hell it couldnt be any worse than the disappointing cats and dogs could it then by december and i suddenly remembered the film i realised how likely the film was to suck the fact it had been delayed in the uk made it seem inevitable it would be terrible but the horrendous reviews just made me realise it was nigh on impossible for the movie to be any good still i swallowed my feelings and went to see the film with a friend today as i entered my screen i was mortified it was the very first time id be seeing a movie with a friend and being the only two in the screen little did i know for what i was about to endure underdog to put it blunt is horrendous it really is imagine how bad you could think this movie is and then prepare yourself for a movie even worse that is just how pathetic the movie is while it aims to entertain kids it just seems an embarrassing mess that seems to insult kids rather than allow them to enjoy the movie matters cannot be helped by the fact that the story is beyond lacklustre the acting is generally poor and the movie just feels like an overlong tired and downright boring saturday cartoon after a brief five minutes where i thought the movie might be passable the movie just suddenly seems to die and then limp on towards the already sign posted finale im just amazed the movie was actually ever released its an embarrassment to disney hell half their straight to video sequels are better than this whats even more terrifying is the fact the ending leaves room for a sequel  so lets get onto the acting cracks knuckles okay let me be honest jason lee is decent his voice suits the canine and had he have been given a decent script he might have made the performance work however with such a dodgy script he just seems to flounder in many ways it reminded me of bill murray in garfield murray did what he could with what he had but what he had wasnt enough to make it passable then we get onto the human actors and well the majority of atrocious alex neuberger plays the friend of underdog jack my biggest concern is that anybody would even take him seriously in an audition the scene where he gets to fly with underdog is perhaps the most cringe worthy scene in the past few years just because his acting is so poor not once did i believe he was a real person in fact part of me is still convinced he was a robot made specially for the movie james belushi seems half dead in the film he has nothing to work with no decent lines he just seems to wander around the set waiting to become relevant to the plot which the writers try to do towards the end but do it in such a poor way its laughable thankfully peter dinklage is the one redeeming factor of the movie he is great as dr barsinister and seems to be having a laugh in the role he steals every scene he is in although thats hardly difficult when he shares screen time with the extremely annoying patrick warburton the rest of the cast are even worse especially taylor momsen she just needs to end her acting career right now  underdog also fails dramatically in terms of delivering anything like a funny scene when the funniest scene involves underdog biting a can and causing dog food to explode everywhere you know there is something drastically wrong this could be easily ignored if the movie had decent action or a good story alas the movie is even worse in both of these terms the effects are so ropey that any scene where underdog flies just seems absurd and the dog uses his powers to such little effect that you frequently forget he has superpowers whats the point in making a film about a super dog if the damned dog never appears super the final fight also verges on embarrassing purely because its ten minutes of nothingness the dog flies other stuff happens some stuff gets chucked about all of this is irrelevant as this stuff is happening for the sake of stuff happening the script as well is dodgy at best and downright pain inducingly awful at worst when someone says look its a plane no its a bird no its a frog yes you read that right i just wanted to burst into tears there and then actually i wanted to walk out by remained compelled to see whether it could get any lower than that point this happens near the end so it doesnt thankfully  overall underdog becomes the worst movie of 2008 at this early period and is actually just as bad as last years epic movie luckily for underdog meet the spartans arrives over here soon and i expect that to be even worse so in case you didnt get the point of my review avoid the film at all costs if you want to see a movie with a dog then watch cats and dogs buy a real dog if necessary just do not see this,negative,0
this film is not only the last piece of the three colours trilogy but also the best of the three and one of the best movies of the 90s theres hardly another movie that so wisely and consequently asks for humanity and respect for every human being   valentine irene jacob lives in geneva where she works as a model though she has a boyfriend she seems to be rather lonely one night she has an accident and injures a dog and who leads her to his owner a retired jugde jeanlouis trintignant who is cynical and spies his neighbors phone calls disgusted by him she cannot go away and they meet again two lonely souls meet each other and they become friends and develop a deep love for each other   the story itself is too complex to be told completely there is another connection between them in a young man who represents both the judge and valentines real love and there is more to their relationship than only friendship  the actors are wonderful irene jacob and jeanlouis trintignant developing a deep and authentic friendship   the topics are of an endless validity fraternity not only in contact with each other but also in the respect for the right of privacy alarmingly we seem to loose this right more and more which makes movies like this one even more important than it might have been in 1994  red is one of the strongest colours that exists representing inner turmoil love anger and passion used here as another protagonist it brings a unmatched depth to the movie a masterpiece,positive,1
this is what happens when you try to adapt a play from the theater look at the end of the picture totally theatrical  with a reminiscent of les liaisons dangereuses the final steamless speech try to make us think that the whole and deep theme of this matter was the manhood who cares by this point it was about manipulation and so the audience feels after this movie has ended  young directors a play is told with the words more than actions a film is the opposite most of the times  and im not talking about the gay theme overly exploited without a point cause theres no explanation of this topic considering the so called philosophic or presumptuous basis to the level that this film should have been called grand gay,negative,0
i watched this film few times and all i can say that this is low budget rubbish and that it does not have anything to do with a real history facts actors performances is very poor but it is result of limited acting possibilities anyone who watched this film now probably think of hitler as some crazy skinny lunatic who running with a gun like some chicago gangster i can only to say that there is much better films about hitler and germany in those years and that rise of evil is very much under average i can recommend german film downfall in which you can see brilliant performance of switzerland actor bruno ganz in a roll of adolf hitler,negative,0
ordinary decent criminal is sad because it is obviously trying to succeed and equally obviously hasnt a chance in hell of making it apparently owing to the absence of a clear sense of purpose a abysmal failure at droll irish comedy with spacey as a thief who enjoys outsmarting the cops and his competition becoming a sort of folk hero in his own mind this flick manages to be mildly amusing when its trying to be funny slightly more than boring when its trying to be interesting and forget sentimental or poignant or endearing though it takes shots at those qualities as well ordinary decent criminal has a clumsy screenplay naive direction journeyman execution thin story poor casting mediocre acting and eventually becomes lost in itself and sinks into a mire of hopeless mediocrity pass on this one d,negative,0
i respect the fact that this is a very popular show however in comparison with robert altmans ingenious hilarious zany and groundbreaking 1970 movie classic this show was probably destined to be lessthanmediocre even if it did run for 11 years that doesnt necessarily make it any good this show formed an alltoointegral part of my early childhood it was on reruns every night and guess whose parents were watching it and laughing it up but its one of the memories i dont miss and now that i actually have seen the movie i can give this series an accurate critique on its own its not nearly 2 out of 10 bad however the characters on this show are nothing like those in the movie some of them technically are the same but theyre only similar in name for instance since when is alan alda anything like donald sutherland his style of humor is totally different as are his characterization and outlook the new characters are not that great they just serve to make you miss the ones that theyre replacing its the same with the new actors including jamie farr the only thing that actually transfers to the series is radar whos still even though played by the same actor merely a pale imitation of the original what else oh yeah with a laugh track it didnt matter whether it was used in surgery scenes or not it comes across as creepy due to whats going on in the other settings and because it lasted nearly four times longer than the actual korean war it takes viewers into this bizarre temporal rift that doesnt work outside the world of cartoons ive never liked this show and i never will,negative,0
this is just the best movie of all times sorry hollywood ive seen it in early 70s as soon as it appeared on the bulgarian tv and i loved it immediately i was 14 then 25 years later i bought it on a video tape and a few months ago it finally appeared on a dvd here in bulgaria i live with this movie 35 years already and so do all my friends and my family my son was a teenager when he saw it for the first time and he loved it immediately too and this is the generation that grew up watching practically only hollywood movies and not speaking or understanding russian at all what makes this masterpiece of danelia so special its difficult to say as it is difficult to describe what the beauty is but the fact is that you can watch this movie dozens of times with the same pleasure as it was the first time i cant remember any other such movie no matter how many millions it cost or how great the cast was chapeau maestro danelia bulgaria loves you,positive,1
a give this movie a 1010 because it deserves a 1010 two of the best actors of their timewalter matthau  george burns collaborate with neil simon and all of the other actors that are in this film  director herbert ross and all of that makes this stage adaption come true the sunshine boys is one of the best films of the 70s i love the type of humor in this film it just makes me laugh so hard  i got this movie on vhs 3 days ago yes vhs because it was cheaperonly 3 i watched it as soon as i got home but i had to watch it again because i kept missing a few parts the first time the second time i watched it it felt a lot better and i laughed a lot harder im definitely going to reget this on dvd because i have to see the special features  its very funny how that happens two people work together as entertainersactorsperformers they get along well on stage but really argue off stage they cant survive another minute with each other then some 15 years later you want to reunite them for a tv special you can find that in this film matthau  burns were terrific in this film its a damn shame they died george burns deserved that oscar he gave a strong comic performance he was also 78 when this movie was filmed so far hes the oldest actor to receive an academy award at an old age jessica tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress richard benjamin was also fantastic in this he won a golden globe for best supporting actor he deserved that golden globe although many people might disagree with what i am about to say everybody in this film gave a strong performance this comedy is an instant classic i highly recommend it one more thing whoever hates this film is a putz,positive,1
i actually liked this movie sure the acting was flat there was no plot and the villain was the lamest that ive seen michael bernardo as dante is worth laughs in his own right with an incredibly funny catchphrase and evil laugh but its worth seeing just for the worst explosion you will ever see outside of the power rangers tv series youll know it when you see it honestly this movie must have the budget of a low grade porno i almost stopped watching after an hour but i recommend watching through the whole thing at the very least theres plenty of eye candy for all to enjoy recommended for viewers with a high tolerance to poor movies,negative,0
the last hunt is one of the few westerns ever made to deal with buffalo hunting both as a sport and business and as a method of winning the plains indian wars before the white man set foot on the other side of the mississippi the plains used to have herds of american bison as large as some of our largest cities by the time of the period the last hunt is set in the buffalo had been all but wiped out the 20th century due to the efforts of conservationists saw a revival in population of the species but not hardly like it once was  robert taylor and stewart granger are costarring in a second film together and this one is far superior to all the brothers were valiant here stewart granger is the good guy a world weary buffalo hunter who has to go back to a job he hates because of financial considerations  the partner hes chosen to throw in with is robert taylor forgetting taylor for the moment i doubt if theres ever been a meaner nastier soul than charlie gilsen who taylor portrays in devils doorway he was an american indian fighting against the prejudice stirred up by a racist played by louis calhern in the last hunt hes the racist here he kills both buffalo and indians for pure pleasure he kills one indian family when they steal his mules and takes the widow of one captive like some barbarian conqueror he expects the pleasure of debra pagets sexual favors hes actually mad when paget doesnt see it that way  no matter how often they refer to russ tamblyn as a halfbreed i was never really convinced he was any part indian its the only weakness i found in the last hunt  however lloyd nolan the grizzled old buffalo skinner taylor and granger bring along is just great nolan steals every scene hes in with the cast   for those who like their westerns real who want to see a side of robert taylor never seen on screen and who dont like cheap heroics the last hunt is the ideal hunt,positive,1
astoundingthis may have been a poor attempt at remaking the already recreated omen movie but i sure enjoyed it  that last man who commented is a fool this movie was one of a kind and the music dark jerry goldsmith himself would had applaud this movie  great recommendations from myself to watch or buy this film  i collect horror movies and soundtracks so listen to what i have to say not that other idiot  there is only one thing that do not fascinate me the endings  according to prophecy it is all inaccurate including final conflict and left behind  but my conclusion being there great moviesand should be seen before the great depression falls upon us and before the democrats take over the presidency too  so signedjacob edera farmer with a mastermind,positive,1
problem child is one of the goofiest movies ever made its not the worst though some people will disagree with me on that but its not the best either its about a devilish 7yearold boy who wrecks comic havoc on a childless couple john ritter amy yasbeck who foolishly adopts him this film is too silly and unbelievable because i dont buy for one second that a child could act as unrurly as the kid does in this film its asinine and preposterous although i did laugh several times throughout i really dont know why but i cant recommend this film i know im being too kind to it if there is one positive thing about problem child is that its better than the sequel which was just awful    out of four,negative,0
i am a huge amy adams fan and have been for many years i am also a big fan of musicals with that said this is not a good movie on any level it is quite dull and the acting overall is very very poor amy adams is awkward to watch act with scott g anderson due to the fact that she is in another league when it comes to acting all the performances come off as very amateur the music performances are pleasant but nothing special   scott g anderson is just an bad actor i assumed he was put in this movie because he has a great voice but its just not the case he has an average voice and sings on key but thats about it  i guess i can see why amy adams did this movie with the singing element i just wish she had not i could rant about other poor elements of this movie but ill leave it at that,negative,0
this film is deeply disappointing not only that wenders only displays a very limited musical spectrum of blues it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings on film that make watching and listening absolutely boring the only highlight of the movie is the interview of a swedish couple who were befriended with jb lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories wenderss introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly  alluding to worlds culture or actually american culture traveling in space but his limited looks on the theme as well as the neither funny nor utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the 30s renders this movie as a mere sleeping aid yawn i had expected more of him,negative,0
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen however the little slave girl alice and jared harris imitating christopher walken is what makes this movie entertaining alices smoking drinking and uncanny way of showing up when her name is called is strange and interesting i have to applaud jared for his christopher walken imitation and christopher walken for allowing this to be in the movie,negative,0
let me start off by saying that i didnt watch this movie at first with high expectations it was recommended to me by a friend with mediocre taste in movies and mtv was pasted on the front cover so i was not expecting much what i was expecting was a tearjerker overly dramatic but at least effective  i was wrong  firstly let me start off that i had never read the book nor watched any other versions of the movie  the acting was my main gripe with the film by god is it awful the main girl is pretty mediocre but when compared to the rest of the cast shes maryl streep the main hero heath is just plain awful he can sing decent sounding clichéd songs but thats about it his acting broke the sad moments by being so bad at points that i just burst into laughter the isabel girl was pretty godawful too and the brother was just a flat character that was played by an actor that couldnt display emotion whatsoever and when he tried to it failed miserably neil patrick harris was the only decent actor playing edward although its obvious the direction was bad because even he did not live up to what ive seen him do oh and the father wasnt halfbad to my memory but he was in the movie for such a small amount of time i can hardly remember  the story itself was not very good more breakups than you can imagine predictable story until the ending which i barely understood extremely onesided characters with no real depth to them overall just not interesting or compelling nothing weve never seen before done much better and nothing worth watching here  the ending is suppose to be a tearjerker it did nothing of the sort the ending isnt built up at all it almost feels like an afterthought in fact i had to ask my friends why the ending actually happened which when they explained it to me i must have had a look on my face of wait when did they say that what never a good sign the editing was probably the worst ive seen though i do understand the fadeinsfadeouts are done because this was originally made for tv but thats really no excuse  overall the movie is just garbage im a sensitive guy i cried during two episodes of the simpsons i never cried during this crap not even close really this movie is not worth your time if you really want to see a tearjerker look elsewhere,negative,0
woeful and unnecessary sequel to a bonafide classic an american werewolf in london was indisputably a gem of a movie humorous demented with just a dash of romance and so very very british it made me want to stand up and sing god save the queen every time the movie ended then came this abomination you know you are in real trouble when the leads are so utterly unlikeable you are glad when they are slaughtered and actually start cheering for the lycanthropes tell you the truth folks i only got about half way through this cgied travesty before losing the will to live and turning it off absolutely pitiful and a putrid waste of anyones time,negative,0
watching this movie was a waste of time i was tempted to leave in the middle of the movie but i resisted i dont know what ridley scott intended but i learned that in the army women get as stupid as men they learn to spit to insult and to fight in combat and thats also a waste of time in my opinion and anyway what the hell was that final scene in lybia are they still fighting gadafi or is it that its easy for everyone to believe islamic people are always a danger,negative,0
still crazy is without a doubt the greatest rock comedy of alltime it has been erroneously compared to this is spinal tap which it has no relation to spinal tap is a satire and quite frankly not a very good one in spite of its outing of many rock clichés unlike tap still crazy is populated by great actors great songs and great human situations you care about the people in still crazy thats all that matters oh yeah the musics pretty damn good too written by mick jones of foreigner and chris difford of squeeze american audiences were already familiar with stephen rea the crying game but would only later become familiar with bill nighy underworld love actually pirates of the caribbean ii and timothy spall the harry potter movies,positive,1
the odd couple 3 outta 5 stars  like most people i will always feel that jack klugman and tony randall are the definitive odd couple their incredible work on the tv series from the early to mid70s was a highwater mark for television at the time easily surpassing the stage and screen versions of the tale nonetheless how can you go wrong with a jack lemmonwalter matthau pairing matthau is in especially good form as oscar the slob lemmon takes a bit of getting used to as felix particularly if you have previously seen tony randalls outstanding performance the script is good definitely neil simons best i will go on record here as stating that neil simon is probably one of the worst most overrated playwrights of american theatre the storyline is simple felix a neat freak and newly separated from his wife moves in with oscar the slob who needs some help saving money for alimony payments their living arrangement becomes much like a marriage as well culminating in some amusing tiffs and spats lots of fun and some great oneliners,positive,1
enhanced by the expressive cinematography of agnes godard beau travail golden door is a visually striking tone poem that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in sicily to ellis island in new york at the turn of the century it is a surreal enigmatic often strange but ultimately deeply rewarding experience interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism the latest film by emanuele crialese respiro is like an impressionistic painting  a cinematic artists rendering of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents crialeses magical mystery tour came about as a result of his visit to the museum on ellis island the looks on the faces of the immigrants depicted in photographs he saw and his research into the harsh policies and procedures used during the admission of immigrants  guided by letters he read of immigrants sent to relatives who remained at home crialese identifies with those impoverished immigrants who were able to see the positive side of things beyond their ordeal to salvatore mancuso vincenzo amato and his older son angelo francesco casisa america is a distant dream that they know nothing about after climbing a rocky mountain to pray to the saints for a sign they are rewarded when they are shown post cards by salvatores younger son pietro filippo pucillo a deaf mute that depict the new world as a land where they can bathe in rivers of milk sit under a money tree or harvest giant onions and carrots  after disposing of their animals in exchange for shoes and suits salvatore his two sons and his elderly mother fortunata aurora quattrocchi set out on their adventure with more hope than trepidation but the equation soon shifts the other way as they board the boat and settle into their crowded thirdclass steerage compartments the mosttalked about scene in the film takes place using an overhead camera that shows masses of people standing as the ship pulls away the frame is divided into those aboard the ship and those waving goodbye from the dock and the way they are separated implies they are being torn asunder from everything familiar  aboard the ship is a mysterious english woman named lucy charlotte gainsbourg crialese does not reveal her past or the reason she is traveling to america but she seems to stand for the onset of the modern world they are entering though they eye each other cautiously lucy becomes interested in salvatore and asks him to marry her in order to allow her to enter the country the voyage is treacherous with a violent storm buffeting the ship shot in almost complete darkness passengers in steerage are tossed against the side of the boat and afterward bodies lie tangled and twisted on the floor as if in a macabre totentanz the rite of passage through immigration processing at ellis island does not become any easier and crialese attacks the way illiterate peasants in the name of preserving civilized society are forced to put puzzles together perform mathematical tasks and undergo humiliating medical examinations to prove they are fit  a marriage brokering ceremony feels like an auction block and the young women look despondent when they are matched with overweight middleaged men this is the only way they can enter the golden door however since single women are rejected unless they have partners ostensibly to prevent the threat of prostitution through the fog the immigrants can barely see the land of milk and honey and there is no statue of liberty asking for the tired and the poor the humbled masses yearning to breathe free in their imagination however the river is still flowing waiting for them to jump in though the ending is ambiguous and one door opens on to a blank wall another door symbolizes a rebirth of the soul and the passage we must all take from the old world to the new,positive,1
this is actually great fun i really enjoyed it even though it wasnt that original at all robert de niro and eddie murphy were great together all the characters are cool and the story is pretty good plus robert de niro and eddie murphy are simply amazing in this rene russo is excellent in her role and there are plenty of laughs to be had throughout especially when deniro spoofs clint eastwood and danny glovers lines plus the finale is just great yes its just another run of the mil buddy buddy cop film but it works due to the fantastic chemistry between de niro and murphy plus it had some great car chase scenes as well its nothing that great really however i found it to be great fun and a perfect way to pass the timehowever the main villain was very weak and wasnt very good at all this is far from being the best buddy buddy cop film however its still a very entertaining one and i thought it was pretty well made and written as well plus the ending was quite funny this is actually great fun i really enjoyed it even though it wasnt that original at all robrt de niro and eddie murphy were great together i highly recommend this one the direction is very good tom dey does a very good job here with great camera work cool angles and keeping the film at a fast pace the acting is a lot of fun robert deniro is amazing as always and is amazing here he is hilarious very likable had fantastic chemistry with eddie murhpy did his usual awesome stuff pulled some really funny faces seemed to be enjoying himselfhad some funny lines and had a really cool character de niro rules eddie murphy is also amazing here he is hilarious like de niro did his usual funny stuff obviously loved being in front of the camera and while he can do this stuff in his sleep he was still a lot of fun to watch murphy rules rene russo is fantastic here she had a cool character and while she didnt have much to do she added a lot of screen presence and made her character interesting always she was just great russo rules william shatner is funny here surprisingly and didnt overdo it and brought some good laughs into the film the main villain is ok but kind of weak and rather bland still he did what he had to do adequately rest of the cast do fine overall i highly recommend this one 12 out of 5,positive,1

flatliners left quite a noticeable impression in my head the story is quick paced and leaves you constantly absorbed and at many times quite tense its about five remarkable student doctors notably julia roberts and kevin bacon among whom one of them has devised the mechanism of remaining dead or getting flatlinedfor a few seconds and then coming back to life  the procedure is quite complex involving a plethora of medical knickknacks  injections electric blankets oxygen masks and a variety of esoteric medical terms i strongly suspect doctors coined all these words so that they never need to get layed off but funnily they follow the kiss original version for engineers keep it simple stupid extended version for doctors keep it stupid simple philosophy as well at the risk of getting euthanized by some revengetaking doctor reader let me continue  so the first guy who gets flatlined hopes to find the answers to life which philosophy and religion cannot convincingly answer he hopes to get it answered and become famous through applied science he flatlines for around two minutes and then comes back into our world left quite shaken during death he has a vision of an incident when he was young which left the strongest impression on his life he killed another boy when he was kid by accident and he still feels responsible for it  with the success of the first flatliner the others follow suit each of them extending their flatline time further and further to test the limits of how long one can remain dead and experience life after death  meanwhile monsters from the past and future keep coming back to haunt them after their flatline experience the first flatliner is haunted by a young kid who tortures him when he is alone the second who cameraed all the women he took to bed sees television sets all over playing his videos the third is haunted by a young girl who he teased in school the fourth is haunted by her suicidedead father for whom she feels responsible  all of them are driven insane by these haunting and obsessions and think that the past seems to want to take revenge on them the main focus on getting flatlined is that your entire life passes through your eyes at the moment of dying whatever stage that is and you are left mostly with the strongest impressions of life in your mind since they didnt die these strong impressions have somehow resurfaced and have become the focus of their lives  all of them somehow come to terms with and extinguish their past demons all of them except the first one who realizes the only way he can move on through life is getting flatlined again during this flatline session he sees himself getting flatlined the first time and also sees the boy he killed trying to kill him this time round the boy kills him this time for a few minutes and in doing so has sought revenge for a few minutes in the movie one is left wondering if he gets to come back thankfully because most of us like happy endings the boy absolves him of his past and he comes back to life again,positive,1
what has to change in todays attitude towards films like boogie nights is the approach the approach is awful comparing it to pulp fiction seeing only the pornography and all its aspects come on people there is more than that in this beautiful motion picture and to all the sceptics hasnt paul thomas anderson proved himself worthy time and time again magnolia is one of the main reasons i watch american films at all and still have faith in this industry that filmmaking is today and what about there will be blood that is a film that will stay in film history whether u like it or not yeah you the socalled consumer you know something fk you you dont deserve this you dont deserve anything so many artists today struggle to get recognition and it has become increasingly difficult to make serious films even mainstream because people just wanna see celebrities doing stupid stuff like that sellout britney spears  anyway this was very painful for me to say because i dont want to see this i dont wanna believe that today all it matters is the adding up of numbers sales revenue and sales return i want to see magic the magic that fellini bergman and kurosawa brought and created through the language of cinema because thats what pta is doing he is creating magic,positive,1
sure the concept had already been done with alf and the charmings thrust modern society onto one or more outofplace characters but i loved both shows and watched them religiously until they ended in 1990 when i learned about scorch i was actually very hopeful for something new as new tv in the 90s so far hadnt impressed me but at least star trek tng and the simpsons were still going  what i got was a big disappointment the acting was awful but considering the ridiculous dialogue and wholly unbelievable writing i cant blame them too much for what they had to work with there were a few humorous moments but most of the deliberate jokes seemed forced in their delivery the whole production work on the show seemed too lowbudget for what was on tv at the time in the 80s it would have fit right in  still it was the first episode and had to introduce the characters and establish the entire premise of the series so i gave it the benefit of the doubt the second episode wasnt as bad and i started to get my hopes back that once it got into its stride the show would improve sadly my vcr ended up not recording the third episode aired i never got to see it and the series disappeared from the tv listings after that all i have now are the first two episodes recorded off the air onto a vhs tape,negative,0
lana turner proved that she could really dance up a storm in this 1940 charmer about the ultimate sacrifice that her sister joan blondell makes for her  when both sisters come to new york they follow blondells beau a wonderful george murphy in this film   as fate would have it the director of the show is impressed with turner but sees nothing ahead for blondell except a job as the cigarettegirl not only does blondell miss stardom boyfriend murphy eddie falls for turner as well so as not to hurt her sister turner is ready to marry the producer of the show a wealthy womanizer who has wed 4 times  the story concludes as best as possible with blondell taking a fast exit back to nebraska look for paul ford as a gossip columnist in the film he is hard to recognize due to the date of the film and the fact that he is much thinner the film leaves you with the question of whether ford and blondell could ever get together  blondell as the devoted sister sacrifices both career and love for her sister this film is sentimental and might have worked better if it had been shot in technicolor  few realize that george murphy the future republican senator from california was quite a song and dance man in his day,positive,1
shortly after seeing this film i questioned the mental competence of every actor and actress that accepted a role elizabeth shue is a commendable actress why would she embrace such an overrated opportunity i must give credit where credit is due though some moments in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixing but they hardly made up for the scathing perverse tendencies of kevin bacons character sebastian caine i wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone man or woman that has any form of selfrespect to account for,negative,0
i happened across bait on cable one night just as it started and thought eh why not im glad i gave it a chance   bait aint perfect it suffers from unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional dumbness but overall this movie worked all the elements aligned just right and they pulled off what otherwise could have been a pretty ugly film   most of that i think is due to jamie foxx i dont know who tagged foxx for the lead but whoever it was did this movie a big favor believable and amazingly likeable foxx glides through the movie smooth as butter and funnier than hell you can tell hes working on instinct and instinct doesnt fail him  the plot while unimportant actually ties together pretty well and theres even a character arc through which foxxs character grows as a person again they couldve slipped by without any of this but it just makes things that much better  im surprised at the low rating for this maybe i just caught this move on the right night or vice versa but id give it a 710 bravo mssr foxx,positive,1
charlie wilson tom hanks is a hardpartying womanizing texas congressman with no discernible legislative record in 1980 he finds himself becoming interested in the plight of afghanistan which is in the midst of a brutal war with the ussr on the auspices of his old flame archconservative texas socialite joanne herring julia roberts he travels to afghanistan to assess the situation and is stunned by what he sees he returns to the us determined to help the afghans only to find his colleagues extremely indifferent to the situation  and himself under investigation for allegations of drug use undeterred wilson recruits herring and the vulgar outcast cia agent gust avrakotos phillip seymour hoffman to begin a convoluted arms deal involving israel egypt pakistan saudi arabia and a mostly unknowing us congress ultimately the afghans defeat the soviets but while america celebrates their victory wilson and avrakotos find their warnings about the instability of postwar afghanistan falling on deaf ears  charlie wilsons war is slick brain candy a really neat film for the more intellectual viewer and fun entertainment for the average filmgoer the movie assembles an astonishing array of talent both in front of and behind the camera and delivers on its promise of being one hell of a good time the films has only one flaw which well arrive at later as an examination of the improbable way in which the 20th centurys largest covert war was waged  and perhaps the way that things get done by the cia and other intelligence agencies  its fascinating  the movie is interesting on a number of levels the story portrayed in the movie  with all of its outrageous doubledealings sneaky covert operations and perhaps most of all its success  would be so outrageous as a work of fiction that it could easily be dismissed as a satire but things really did work out this way at least within reasonable bounds the film portrays our three protagonists in an interesting way that highlights their virtues without obscuring their flaws wilson as a person who is unapologetic about his vices even embracing them  yet willing to embrace a righteous cause herring is something of an elitist and her bornagain attitude of righteousness is offputting  yet shes deeply committed to the cause of the afghan people avrakotos is a cia outsider with an attitude problem looked down upon because of his street background  yet his love of country and hatred of communism are unwavering the fact that this odd trio could play a major role in the downfall of the ussr is not only proof that anyone can make a difference but also that truth is stranger than fiction its also very interesting that all of this is played as a comedy  not too surprising given that our writer is aaron sorkin but its an interesting way to approach this story  the movie does however have one drawback which is a bit surprising the film seems to unabashedly celebrate wilson and cos achievement this is fine  nothing wrong with defeating the soviet union is there  until one considers that out of the ashes of the soviet defeat in afghanistan came the taliban and eventually alqaeda regardless of the uss level of responsibility it happened and the movies portrayal of wilsons success is almost unmitigated to be fair the movie does address this issue towards the end with a rather topical speech by wilson about the uss inability to clean up after themselves but its done in such a tertiary manner that the average viewer will probably not take much from it the overall impression will be that these three remarkable people helped the afghans defeat the soviets this isnt a fatal drawback mind you but its one troubling aspect of an otherwise brilliant movie   the films talent is remarkable the legendary mike nichols delivers a slick gorgeouslooking production the material is perfectly suited to his understated wry directorial style sorkin delivers yet another brilliant screenplay the film has dozens of quotable lines and classic sorkin exchanges the best being the scotch bottle discussion between wilson and avrakotos and keeps something of a political and historical perspective behind it the films cast is a marvel tom hanks gives a fine performance as the lovable rogue with a cause julia roberts is alternately charming and repulsive as the obnoxious but committed joanne and phillip seymour hoffman steals every scene par usual as the abrasive gus the alwayslovely amy adams takes another step on her road to stardom as wilsons long suffering assistant and ned beatty om puri emily blunt christopher denham and ken stott flesh out the supporting cast  charlie wilsons war is an intelligent and fun movie a wonderful bit of abitmorethanlight entertainment the fact that it decides not to be more than that shouldnt be held against it its brilliant at what it does  810,positive,1
it starts off pretty well with the accident and the decision not to return to la but everything falls into place too quickly there is a decent plot twist towards the end but so many scenes that dont make sense randy played by brian austin green comes home angry and ready to confront people and he takes the time to put on the club when he parks his car in front of his house in the middle of nowhere i dont want to spoil it for anyone who does decide to see it but the last 45 minutes are ridiculous even the acting which wasnt bad early on turns bad towards the end dont bother unless you want to see how bad it is,negative,0
i dont know why but i thought ive seen this movie before maybe it was the name maybe it was the way poster looked i dont know anyway it was quite promising in the beginning and even throughout the whole feature there were some bright moments maybe its because im not a huge fan of the horrors and i dont watch them a lot but this one actually looked fresh sometimes but the rest of it is not so good laughable at times the movie is slow paced sometimes you will get so bored youd forget what was the story about characters are not great either all of them the butcher is ok seems creepy and crazy enough although i didnt get what were those weird looking things on his chest that whole scene just looked fake and kind of outoftheblue and why he was collecting those in jars at home the main lead is plain his character is really hard to believe in and very undeveloped but i guess thats scenarists fault like why he cried when he was taking pictures of his girlfriend side cast is bad too but the main thing i hated in this movie was the girl my god when will women in horror movies have any brains its ridiculous the girl finds out that a maniac took her boyfriends camera tries going to police that fails and then she thinks of the best idea ever why dont we just go and take it i know where the maniac lives yup thats swell and then look for the camera in the bathroom why not and then walk in the room see a bag that was not there before and just have a look inside maybe camera is there not there but loads of interesting stuff shiny mmmm to realize that bag means that the butcher came back is too hard for her tiny tiny brain then of course the never ending falling while running away trick that really made it look bad then to put the final nail into the character in the end of the movie she walks into the wagon full with dead bodies hanging feet up screams noooo like she just ripped her gucci bag and walks further into the wagon jeez come on no one else thinks its just well stupid just awful if her character wasnt so bad maybe the movie would get another star or two from me and i would even forgive mmt characters that can take a hit in the head with a steel hammer that dude in the train who the conductor killed butcher vests that can protect from bullets weird and cheap looking monsters in the end i didnt read clive barkers novel so i have no idea where those monsters came from the fact that no one cared that hundreds judging on the skeletons in the dungeon disappeared in the city and main character that didnt bleed to death when he got his tongue ripped out he barely noticed it i guess oh and the predictable ending damn i knew the ending half way in its just disappointing the only reason im still giving some credit to the makers is that the movie in general looks better than most of the horrors ive watched past few months visual style is nice some shots were really nice and good cgi that made the killings look really brutal although blood didnt look real at all i guess some people will enjoy it some like me will watch it if there is nothing else to watch some will absolutely hate it,negative,0
just finished watching the movie and wanted to give my own opinionand justice to the movie  first of all to get things straight this movie is not pretending to be anything other than a solid action comedy movie it doesnt aim to revolutionize the movie industry and garner critical acclaims nor does it want to be regarded as one if you really want to enjoy this movie to the fullest i suggest you discard your criticalmindedness and your longing for a good plot because you wont find any in here with that established let us further into the movie  i had low expectations for this movie simply because it didnt have a strong plotyes moviegoers i underrated this movie as well but i never expected myself to enjoy this movie that much i even enjoyed this more than the stephen chow flickswhich i find kung fu hustle to be his best effort and wouldve rated it a 9 as well action is tight and epic while comedy chokes on to the right places  spoilers alert i think the action might be unreal but why would i want to watch a serious basketball movie anyways there are a lot other sports moviesdrama that already did it well why create another spoilers end  im not even sure why youre reading this go ahead and watch it just remember no thinking  just watch enjoy smile laugh and   every once in a while theythe movie industry creates masterpieces such as pulp fiction or the godfather movies and sometimes they create movies which are better off in the pile of dump im not saying kung fu dunk deserves the recognition that the previous examples have then again if were talking about stephen chowish comedy this ones a top ten  highly recommended if you love no brainer movies with really good action kung fu death trance kung fu and comedy what the heck watch this youll have a great time  910 for you the cast of kung fu dunk ,positive,1
if i was only allowed to watch one program in my entire life i would definitely have to pick the chasers war on everything of all the satirical shows that have been on australian television i found chaser to be the funniest of all it is just so amazing the boys arent afraid to do anything  whether its dress up as hitler to get into a polish club or push a massive ball of string around melbourne to try out the tourism ads or rock up to the coke factory naked in a bath with 240 to buy some water the chaser boys will go there  in agreement with the comments above andor below the chasers war on everything is more popular than their previous program cnnnn but cnnnn was just as funny some unforgettable moments from that show clean up cambodia classic  so anyway to stop me from ranting further i strongly advise you to at least give chaser a chance youll more than likely find it hilarious,positive,1
drab morality tale about a high school kid whos pretty much the nowstereotypical nerd hes smart but has no friends no social skills and a lazy loser of a father who borrows money from him a pretty girl hits on himhe shouldve known she wanted somethinghes supposed to be smart right she manipulates the poor desperate fool into writing her term paper on shakespeare which the teacher immediately knows she couldnt have written he loses the girlnot that he ever really had her the confidence of his teacher and his college scholarship all in one fell blow  marv is so silly and desperate for love that he decides to rob some heroin dealers who are running the stuff through the warehouse he works at then maybe the trashy little slut will be impressed and want to marry him sad really sad marv is such a pathetic dopeand pretty brainless for a supposedly smart guy i mean trying to rob drug dealers has this kid got a screw loose that you stop feeling sorry for him and get the dreadful urge to kick him in the butt instead  the girl of course tells her boyfriend about the robbery marv boasted of to her and talks him and his cronies into stealing the money from marv and company they try to do so and in the process manage to shoot several people the cops show up at the same time and the idiot marv is dragged away a total disgrace forever i know this thing was geared towards making teens behave themselves by showing them the consequences of bad behavior but all it really illustrated was the consequences of stupid behavior which is the premature end of your film career of course goodbye marv we never really knew ya and thank goodness for that,negative,0
perhaps one of the worst teenage slasher films i ever did see ill start with the bad points of t he movie which pretty much covers the entire film first of all something no one can avoid terrible acting i swear they picked up some random kids off the street based on how they looked secondly badunconvincing character workdevelopment you hardly even know half the kids who are killed in here all you figure is that they deserved it one way or another the scarecrows character was overdone and a cheap ripoff of the other great fantasy killers such as freddy or pinhead next bad dialog the scarecrow was full of horrid oneliners that would make you laugh only because it was so terrible lines like lets go find some small animals to torture really just leaves you with an eyebrow raised last but not least next off bad casting how old was the guy who played lester like 30 the back of his head was balding for gods sake there is much more i could say about this film like its cheap special effects its high school film class effort but the point is understood its just bad film making at its worst as for what i found to be good in the movie entertaining for those with low low low standards would help put insomniacs to sleep a very cheap laugh or even a giggle,negative,0
everyone has their choice for worst movie theyve ever seen some like to pick on gigli or battlefield earth some pick on classics like plan 9 from outer space ever since i was 14 i have been very vocal in saying that to me it is problem child 2 and 9 years later i feel the exact same way its not one of the worst its not just an expression it is the actual worst movie i have ever seen  how much farting pooping peeing and puking can you put in a single movie i dont need to see a dog take a dump that goes up to my waist why is it that im so hard on this filth i have nothing against bathroom or grossout humor heck i like the american pie movies having such an excess of it within 90 minutes is a bad idea but the true tipping point is to do it with kids having little kids call each other sexual names imdb wont even let me post that word on here yet here it is coming out of the mouths of 8 year olds think of the irony in that and urinate and puke on each other just makes the whole thing feel dirtier worst line in the movie i guess i should fart in more peoples offices   what other film has urination into lemonade dynamite sticks exploding toilets a little boy filming his babysitter having sex and projecting it on the side of the house and a little girl joking about scratching testicles   however my absolute favorite moment has to be when the same little girl is on a carnival ride says im gonna puke opens her mouth and fake looking puke shoots straight out of her open mouth in a perfect 90 degree angle the puking scene in scary movie 2 looked more real than that   i suppose the only redeeming element in the movie is gilbert gottfried you get the impression that he didnt even have a script but was just being his usual self too bad he has to act stupid while pizza gets thrown on him  you know what thinking about the movie this much has just made me have to go to the bathroom goodbye,negative,0
apparently hollywood is just handing out money to anyone with a camera and the ability to speak this movie was mind numbingly bad the casting was terrible the acting unspeakable and the story filled with holes script who needs script i was surprised that the movie wasnt as verbally vulgar as i thought it would be however i got enough shots of ta to last me a lifetime the movie was like listening to a 19 year old street racer with add who decided to buy a car instead of go to college tell a story being so poorly scripted i thought the two brothers in the film were lovers at first the scenes at the racetrack along with the main female actor in the film kept making me think of herbie fully loaded this is the kind of film is what grindhouse modeled itself afteronly the writers thought they were being serious,negative,0

well to start with rajkumar santoshi is not a comedy film maker and this is really unfortunate because the only comedy film he has made is a masterpiecethis film is really funny loud in bits overacted in a few scenes but still the dialogues r really laugh riots and characters r really full of fun  story line in simple a billionaires daughter come to india for marriage and two young chaps r behind her the story has a twist as well with a connection of a gangster aamir playing a street smart guy amar has played his role with brilliance and salman has played the role of an innocent stupid to perfectionraveena has done fine but karshima really turns irritating in some sequences but real show stealer r paresh rawal and shakti kapoor they enter the frame and automatically u start laughing  overall such an enjoyable film that u can watch it any no of times without getting bored,positive,1
this was one of those films i probably never would have picked off the shelf  but it came on ifc one day and i said  eric stolz william forsythewhy not if id changed the channel i would have really missed a treasure   the subject is depressing  young author paralyzed in climbing accident convalesces in lowerclass rehabilitation center it would have been so easy and tempting to make this a manipulative tearjerker but that doesnt happen because it was written by neal jimenez after he himself was accidently paralyzed no hollywood happiness here all of the patients in the ward come from wildly different backgrounds but they share a feeling of helplessness of being at the mercy of others stolz is very good as a lone wolf type forced into embarrassing dependence on his girlfriend helen hunt wesley snipes is fine as a former ladies man whose family is falling apart but william forsythe takes the cake as a tough guy determined to make someone pay for taking away his independence  see this film,positive,1
this has got to be the worst movie i haver ever seen nielson in this movie just does not have what he needs to be funny i think the reasons that the naked gun and the like movies is that they did not require nielson to be funny he just played the roles as straight as he could while all of the comedy that went on was mostly visual but when you put him in a movie where he has to be funny he isnt the movie had only one good part and this may be considered a spoiler by some and that the beginning credits were animated if the whole movie had been animated it might have been good i had no intention of seeing this movie when i saw the ads for it and the only reason i did see it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won them in a radio contest this is the first and probably only movie i have ever walked out on on a scale of 110 i give this movie a score of 100,negative,0
i am so disappointed in this movie i cant express it i was so excited when i started watching this film to see mickey rourke all leather faced and that kid from third rock from the sun acting like i psycho i thought wow this is going to be a winner freakin natural born killers style and it got better the production value was great the directing was great the acting was great the cinematography was great and the plot was well the plot well what what plot about half way through this film i was pulling my hair out yelling what the hell is going on and i mean that quite literally nothing makes any sense whatsoever nothing nothing nothing aaaaaaahhhhhhggg,negative,0
a wellmade and imaginative production refreshingly free from cliché this somewhat picaresque affair recounts a tale of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy under less than ideal conditions the man an escaped convict who has kidnapped the youth for his value as a hostage expertly directed by alan gibson with a fine sense for balanced narrative movement the film provides freshness in nearly every scene as felon martin steckert richard harris believing that his rejection for parole was particularly undeserved contrives a convoluted but ultimately successful escape plan following which his spontaneous nature comes to the fore as he flees to the lakeside residence of his childhood often bursting into song or dancing a few steps the capricious steckert gradually gains the trust and affection of his captive and as police close in for an inevitable showdown the tethered pair are seen to be a great deal alike in their responses to forms of rejection as discerned by a psychiatrist lindsay wagner assigned to aid a zealous police lieutenant james coburn who is in charge of the manhunt for steckert and his prisoner this is an engrossing story worth telling a quicklypaced and novel adventure that profits from a capital performance by harris fine turns from wagner coburn and karen black along with justin henry as the snatched lad with an appropriately whimsical score contributed by wilfred josephs and topnotch cinematography by frank watts with all footage shot in a beautiful autumnal ontario province,positive,1
i recently saw this film at a 3d film festival in hollywood it was in polarized 3d gray glasses not red  blue it was so much fun to watch this film with an audience the print was excellent and the 3d perfect the performances were over the top and that added to the fun the surprise ending that we arent supposed to share with fellow movie goers at least according to the movie trailer and poster had people howling with laughter by todays standards this is probably more comedy than horror but with the added dimension of 3d complete with cobwebs and bats coming out of the screen this film was an entertaining romp into 50s horror,positive,1
this is one of the greatest love story movies i have ever seen yes i can agree that some parts may seem dated but this does not distract from the film one should try to observe criticize and enjoy any art form from the perspective of the time clearly by the sex in the city standards charlie chaplin was horribly boring however when judged from the prospective of 1925 america he was fantastic likewise sayonara is a breakthrough film in its look into a mixedrace love affair american manifest destiny arrogance and prejudice and the complexity of different cultures it is a natural next step to such films as gentlemans agreement its purpose however was not just social commentary rather it is entertaining and enjoyable with innumerable lines that one just doesnt forget  however even when taken only as a love story it is terrific although some attack brandos accent he is at his near best in nuance and characterization buttons and umeki who both won oscars and the rest of the supporting cast add much to the film  taka the real star does a fabulous job making you feel the passion she has for brando while being torn by her sense of obligation and loyalty her speech when she first meets and speaks with brando is a classic and something rarely if ever matched in cinema the dialog between taka and brando in her dressing room in tokyo at the films end is equally good of course it doesnt have the mouthsucking spitswapping and worse that exemplifies love in todays movies but that makes it all the better it portrays true love and passion and not just heat if this movie doesnt touch you then you are just too young too cynical or dead,positive,1
this is movie is garbage it looked really funny on the previews but i didnt laugh once through the whole movie do yourself a big favor and dont waste your money on this dont waste anyones money on this i gave it a 110 believe me i would have given it less if i could have im a 15 year old guy and i thought it was trash if you wanna see a good movie go out and see jay and silent bob strike back,negative,0
the cast was good and i thought it was a good performance from christopher lloyd whom i like from previous movies the movie was a great family movie nothing that would make you worry to show it to younger kids a good story line lots of laughs lighthearted and enjoyable if you want to entertain children without being bored to tears this fits the bill kid pleasing and not difficult for a parent to watch either,positive,1
this is a ripoff from cellular   bad casting   bad direction   bad music  and the list goes on  well there was no direction since story scenes and setting were lifted straight off of other movie   even fight sequence is copied one with the mace was from kill bill and another one with fire hose was from either a jet lis or jackie chans movie i am not able to recall the name of this movie   stay away from this cheap imitation and try to see the real thing   cannot expected something original from any of the bhatts any more,negative,0
naturally i didnt watch gi jane out of choice i was more or less forced to watch this film round my exgirlfriends house  gi jane loses its credibility straight away by trying to convince the viewer that it is potentially a real scenario which of course it isnt the result of this is that the story becomes automatically bound by constraints restricting the amount of humour of which there is none or entertaining action scenes and soon becomes too serious the film therefore becomes extremely boring and predictable  gi jane fails where other action films succeed mainly because films such as james bond dirty harry and various others are larger than life yet never proclaim to be otherwise they are escapism and therefore entertaining gi jane tries to be real and fails  this is a very disappointing film from ridley scott with a very noncredible storyline unremarkable acting and the only reason i give it 210 instead of 110 is for some of the technical work,negative,0

a wonderful television miniseries completely ruined by a 45year old woman trying desperately to pass herself off as a 16year old ingenue no exaggeration  thats the actual age of the character played by ali macgraw when the film opens just prior to the surprise attack at pearl harbor this tv miniseries really is the most classic example of the title of this post and one i refer to whenever the topic comes up  that alone makes this completely unwatchable despite the fact its one of the best filmed wwii global dramas tv has ever produced if you have the stomach  or a decent fastforward ability  you might be able to enjoy the late robert mitchum in a very strong performance   im stunned at some of the comments referring to the love story pun intended did they watch the film with their eyes closed or are they aging boomers who never cease to amaze me with their selective memories and selective vision im a boomer myself so dont think for a second im some hubristic young punk 45 will always look 45 get used to it deal with it age gracefully damnit  the winds of war could have been so good how much more would we be talking about this miniseries today some 25 years later had an actual ingenue been cast in such an important  critical role right now with the constant haggard old biddy distraction that alone cancels out most of the wonderful aspects of the winds of war,negative,0
this film isnt a comedy its an expose ive always hated dog shows considering the ridiculous getups people put their dogs in and the idiotic names they give them hence the reason for my uncontrolled cackling while watching this film i get a kick out of something being taken so seriously even though the gains are small and insignificant its like miniature golf or jump roping championships or the need to set some obscure world record the acting was much more refined in this film than waiting for guffman and its mainly due to the more fluidity of the characters who seem more comfortable with their specific acting partners in this film than the previous eugene levy was great as was michael mckean and fred willard however it was the dogs who eventually stole the show but then again who wants to see a bunch of humans in a film about dogs anyway,positive,1
great little groundbreaking movie in 1955 about an important subject  i wasnt expecting much from sinatras performance and was pleasantly surprised by it loved kim novak she was gorgeous  loved the jazz score by elmer bernstein as great as that by lazlo schifrin for bullitt i am very surprised it doesnt seem available on cd if anyone knows about the soundtracks availability on any other format they should post it here somewhere  premingers direction was as usual borderline flawless  havent read nelson algrens novel nor have any idea how faithful the screenplay was to it the subplot of frankie as a hot card dealer was a bit of a surprise too as were a few other things but see for yourself its very much worth seeing,positive,1
i sat through both parts of che last night back to back with a brief bathroom break and i cant recall when 4 hours last passed so quickly id had to psyche myself up for a week in advance because i have a real thing about directors producers and editors who keep putting over blown over long quasi epics in front of us and i feel that on the whole 2 to 25 hours is about right for a movie so 4 hours seemed to be stretching the limits of my tolerance and i was very dubious about the whole enterprise but i will say upfront that this is a beautifully  i might say lovingly  made movie and im really glad i saw it director steven soderbergh is to be congratulated on the clarity of his vision the battle scenes zing as if you were dodging the bullets yourself  if there is a person on the planet who doesnt know ernesto che guevara was the argentinian doctor who helped fidel castro overthrow fulgencio batista via the 1959 cuban revolution when i was a kid in the 1960s ches image was everywhere on bedroom wall posters on t shirts on magazine covers ches image has to be one of the most over exploited ever if the famous images are to be relied on then che was a very good looking guy the epitome of revolutionary romanticism had he been butt ugly i have to wonder if he would have ever been quite so popular in the public imagination of course dying young helps  movies have been made about che before notably the excellent motorcycle diaries of 2004 which starred the unbearably cute gael garcia bernal as young che touring south america and seeing the endemic poverty which formed his marxist politics but i dont think anyone has ever tackled the entire story from beginning to end and this twoparter is an ambitious project i hope it pays off for soderbergh but i can only imagine that instant commercial success may not have been uppermost in his mind  the first movie the agentine shows che meeting castro in mexico and follows their journey to cuba to start the revolution and then the journey to new york in 1964 to address the un cleverly shot black and white images look like contemporary film but arent the second film guerilla picks up again in 1966 when che arrives in bolivia to start a new revolutionary movement the second movie takes place almost entirely in the forest as far as i can see it was shot mostly in spain but i can still believe it must have been quite grueling to film benicio del toro is excellent as che a part he seems born to play  personally i felt that the argentine ie part one was much easier to watch and more entertaining in the strictly movie sense because it is upbeat they are winning the revolution will succeed che is in his element leading a disparate band of peasants workers and intellectuals in the revolutionary cause the second part is much harder to watch because of the inevitability of his defeat in much the same way that the recent valkyrie  while being a good movie  was an exercise in witnessing heroic failure so i felt the same about part two of che guerilla we know at the outset that he dies we know he fails it is frustrating because the way the story is told it is obvious fairly early on that the fomentation of revolution in bolivia is doomed che is regarded as a foreign intruder and fails to connect with the indigenous peoples in the way that he did with the cubans he doggedly persists which is frustrating to watch because i felt that he should have known when to give up and move on to other perhaps more successful enterprises the movie does not romanticise him too much he kills people he executes he struggles with his asthma and follows a lost cause long after he should have given up and moved on he leaves a wife alone to bring up five fatherless children  but overall an excellent exercise in classic movie making one note as i watched the us trained bolivian soldiers move in en masse to pick off che and his small band of warriors one by one it reminded me of the finale to butch cassidy i almost turned to my husband and said so but hesitated thinking he would find such thoughts trite and out of place as we left the theatre he turned to me and said didnt you think the end was like butch cassidy,positive,1
i was taken to this film by a friend and was sceptical about a swedish film with subtitles however i thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this beautiful film the unnecessary cruelty that man is capable of was portrayed confidently without overwhelming images  although animal lovers may have to shield their eyes for a brief couple of seconds somewhere during the first 10 minutes a traditional story of humility versus brutality and hope versus tragedy was illustrated from a satisfyingly fresh angle using a spectrum of characters with very natural flaws and features i particularly liked how the film managed to address multiple aspects of hypocritical human behaviour that concern bias discrimination and sanctimonious pretence an absolute gem of a film that i will promote to all who will listen,positive,1
this movie was a stupid piece of crap bad everything why is it that we who love western movies get jilted nine out of ten times when renting westerns it seems that if you dont see names like robert duval kevin kostner or tom selleck attached to the cover it isnt worth messing with for the most part the main action of shiloh falls was taking place in 1892 yet the revolvers used were 1860s models even the shooting was bad  in one scene the marshal fanned his sixshooter about nine times and couldnt hit any of three large men who were only about twenty feet away i had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this inanity perhaps those who participated in this movie could have taken some lessons at the sunset carson school of acting,negative,0
you know this movie isnt that great but i mean cmon its about angels helping a baseball team i find the plot line to be hilarious anyways this kids dad says hell take him back if the angels win the pennant because he knows they wont kid prays to his fake god to help the angels win god helps the whole time via the angel christopher lloyd rip and in the end his dad doesnt take him back and rides off on his motorcycle right in that kids face its hilarious until danny glover adopts it and its friend  i guess the upside is that the old lady is left alone to die with her stitchin projects and her stories the real winner here though is god because later he got a job as a writer for numerous prank shows  as a kids movie it gets a 7 as a movie about the mysteries of blind stupid faith and the nature of god it gets a 10,positive,1
who the heck is responsible for this terrible mangling of one of my favorite books this is just terrible terrible acting terrible script the story isnt even close to its old self  and what were they thinking robin williams for goshs sake this really defies description dont see this seriously dont not even for laughs especially not if youre a fan of the book this might just be the worst movie adaptation ever  everything is disjointed and scrambled  the characters which are important in order to understand the sequence of events are seriously marginalized and every potentially interesting location from the book has been changed example vienna  new york into something profoundly uninteresting  for those who havent read the book  its basically a fictional biography about a writer growing up exploring his writing and so on his mother writes an autobiography which is hailed despite her protests as a sort of feminist manifesto the book is wellwritten engaging and long its prose is simply beautiful  this movie on the other hand is about robin williams once again telling us to seize the day,negative,0
how could 4 out of 16 prior voters give this movie a 10 how could more than half the prior voters give it a 7 or higher who is voting here i can only assume it is primarily kids  very young kids the fact is that this is a bad movie in every way the story is stupid the acting is hard to even think of as acting the characters are characterless and the dialogue is terrible i saw this one rainy afternoon on the scifi channel in the sad event that it is ever rebroadcast i suggest you read a book instead,negative,0
ive been trying to remember the name of this movie for years not consecutively of course i saw it at the local dollar theater when i was 11 and it was so atrocious i almost walked out i think i didnt realize one was allowed to leave before the movie ended anyway it stuck in my mind as just about the worst movie i saw growing up i can finally give it the rating it deserves  110 that was strangely satisfying,negative,0
this made for tv film is about every cliché you can come up with for a disaster movie the only problem is it isnt very well done  my brain is still insulted from the scenes in which brian dennehy is supposedly looking at a computer monitor looking for weather pattern data and showing on that monitor are stock footage scenes of weather turmoil ala the weather channels commercials why would watching local news footage of a washed out sidestreet give insight to global weather patterns you got me  also interspersed through out the first two hours are some of the worst cgi effects known to man watch for the semi truck and the airplane that look like they were rendered on a commodore 64  all the foreshadowing in this movie is done with the subtlety of a sledgehammer the dialog is forced and i cant think of a likable character that i want to survive the second half  the character i hate the most is the stupid wife whos husband is cheating maybe if she lifted a finger at anytime during the show instead of being a helpless woman who stands in the the same 10 square feet of the kitchen all day her husband wouldnt be sleeping with the pr rep for a rival energy company she is so helpless in fact i want to put her out of her and my misery i hope everyone in this movie dies in the second half,negative,0
one can only hope that there are many times when someone as powerful as morgan freeman can take the time to assist someone who needs help  it all comes down to loving people as will rogers said i never met a man i didnt like of course if you meet paz vega whats not to like that smile of hers can melt diamonds she is just so fantastic that i can watch anything she is in the same goes for freeman he is just magic on the screen  the two of them gave us a film that was funny from start to finish from the mexican supermarket to lorraine  bobby to packy it was tender charming and just plain funny  you have to check this out,positive,1
riding giants is an incredible documentary detailing the history and stories of three influential bigwave surfers gregg noll jeff clark and laird hamilton stacy peralta did an amazing job taking on the role of director and should be congratulated for doing such a brilliant job the structure of the film is edited brilliantly and works perfectly with the narration interviews animation and surfing footage the music soundtrack just adds to the overall satisfaction of watching this film making riding giants brilliant viewing personal highlights include any of greg nolls comments what with his straighttothepoint frankness laird hamiltons footage at teahupoo and the outtakes at the end of the movie but really this entire film is one big recommended highlight that comes highly recommended if you have the opportunity to see its a shame it isnt more well known but it is a gem deserving of attention 1010,positive,1
i thought the movie was pretty good i really enjoyed myself as i viewed it however the last scene at johnnys birthday party was cut way too short i myself was an extra in that scene and was upset with the results but other than that and the weird casting the movie was superb,positive,1
i watch this movie at the start of every summer and it never ceases to amuse me here the jokes are packed in near every line of dialogue giving you more bang than the average simpsons episode some of the jokes fall flat or will only elicit a slight chuckle but others will leave you rolling and then there are those that stick in your brain the audience is now deaf  the video knows its a video and makes no pretensions about being anything else its easy to sit back and let the bombardment of humor begin a good mix of slapstick pop culture and tongueincheek comedy ensures theres something for everybody i was in sixth grade when i first saw this video and i have to admit i still find it as hilarious now that ive started college  this is a good movie to watch over the summer much in the way you might watch its a wonderful life at christmas or ten commandments at easterpassover more than that its just funny as hell,positive,1
why were there so many people crowding into an evening showing of roberto moreiras up against them all contra todos at the san francisco film festival its about a hit man my friend said well   and its brazilian i added beautiful multicolored people tropical weather lush rhythms and a hip gangster plot ample enticements no doubt  somebody forgot to tell us one little detail this is a very bad movie really pretty horrible and as unpleasant to watch as it is poorly made  so how on earth did contra todos get to make the rounds of berlin melbourne london manila stockholm cairo chicago numerous smaller local festivals and now san francisco apparently because of the way the promotional process and the film festival circuit work  first of all it won first prize at the rio film festival where it was called the best brazilian movie of the year it must have been a bad year theyve had much much better ones next snappy synopses in catalogs plus imaginary buzz lead to crowded auditoriums and  since the movie isnt featured anywhere and so avoids close scrutiny by critics  it keeps going the rounds  festival blurbs aimed at promotion sometimes goose it up a lot a chicago festival one called contra todos a speedball cocktail shot straight out of brazil and referred to claudias s boyfriend as the stud of the slumlike neighborhood soninha is teodoros nymphlike teenaged daughter of burgeoning sexuality the movie is shot with the urgency of a frequently handheld camera and the director works up a genuine and palpable sense of frustration borne from domestic desperation and decay the effect is  unbearably raw and honest and the movie hurtles toward a conclusion as deadended as the lives on display not the best writing but it sure pumps up the excitement for a certain kind of potential viewer  contra todos does concern a hit man two hit men actually and a wife and daughter and a bornagain christian girlfriend its shot  in execrably ugly digital video with no talent behind the camerawork  mostly in a barrenlooking poor suburb rather than in one of the teeming favelas or villagelike brazilian city slums where such wonderful films as black orpheus pixote and city of god were made and not in rio this time but são paulo  the hit man with family problems is teodoro  giulio lopez and his partner with a drug problem is waldomiro ailtan graça both actors have a little tv experience as does the actress who plays teodoros sluttish blonde wife cláudia leona cavalli and silvia lorenço who plays his pouting readytorevolt daughter soninha these actors might make it through the back corners of a few telenovelas who knows  in a better directed film they might even be good aside from them there are some young men who get bumped off by teordoro or when hes busy gangs of thugs the principals dont work up much presence even though the camera magnifies their pores  a couple of observers one at the berlin festival and one at londons did see this movies failings but alas theyre buried in the web hinterlands henry sheehan noted from berlin that the film his quotes was the worst of the video works shown the filmmaker seems to have chosen video simply because it was a cheap alternative to film sheehan wrote and hasnt made any creative use of the new medium  nor he adds done anything else creative  sheehan pointed out the movies first big mistake it starts off as a domestic drama thats supposed to ratchet up when half an hour into the action moreira reveals that the father and one of his friends are professional hit men waiting the thirty minutes adds nothing to the movie it seems like a perfectly arbitrary decision and is at the very least a waste of time but ratcheting up is all moreira ever does like a little kid whos gotten a tool kit for his birthday and goes around banging everything in sight without rhyme reason or skill devastating but true  writing about the 2004 london festival for kameracom metin alsanjak tried to look at the positive side but nonetheless gave away the lack of redeeming features in calling the performances easily the films best feature yes very easily given that everything else is so bad alsanjak admitted that  this lowbudget violent and seedy account of the lawless in sao paulo is devoid of any likable characters and as a result of hope too dark and cynical to be a telling account of the human condition the film is not helped by poor subtitling  alsanjaks connecting contra todos to dogme and mike leigh didnt help matters  apart from that meaningless first half hour in which nothing redeems the boredom of our wait for the first acts of violence  which when they come are just banging everything in sight without rhyme reason or skill  moreira clumsily tries to redeem his abrupt finale by adding what appear to be outtakes right after it followed by an implausible ironic concluding scene where one of the characters gets married no doubt the director wanted to exhibit the banality of evil of lowlevel hit men in working class neighborhoods but he cant make the characters which he sees generically come alive for us and the structure of the film shows that he also cant edit his material   seen at the san francisco international film festival on april 28 2005,negative,0

this film is based on the novel by john fante could someone please tell me why i see absolutely no reason why this fine book should be adapted in this way if you want to make a romantic melodramatic hollywood production with colin farell and selma hayek then how could you possibly make a connection to ask the dust the novel and if you wanted to make this story into a film then why would you want to make it into a romantic melodramatic hollywood production with colin farell and selma hayek i dont get it  the adaptation of the story is poorly made and if you have read the book and liked it im almost sure you wont like what towne did with it   in the beginning of the film youll maybe find the casting odd the acting bad and the cinematography just a bit overdone but you hope for the best i really hoped a lot during this film i actually wanted it to be good but it only gets worse and it is as simple as that whether you read fantes novel or not this is not a good film just another romantic melodramatic hollywood production combined with bad acting lack of structure and  of course  plenty of shots of colin farells naked butt  i could complain a lot more about this film but why waste my time ive seen it alright i had to see it because i like the book so much and was curious and im very disappointed  110 is for colins sweet little mustache in the end of the film so sweet had he worn it the whole time through id given it 210,negative,0

this is a very good black comedy with a great view on how different people have a different perception of the same situations the three main characters each met a girl named jewel played by liv tyler who is a different male fantasy for each of the three men each of the three men go through the same situations but when they tell of them to other people their perception of the situation is very different from what the other two say that is a very good concept probably not entirely original but it works very well in the movie the plot is very good very bizarre and extreme which makes it a good black comedy the acting is equally good not one of the actors seemed out of place or out of their league the comedy is very black pitch black in some scenes and a lot of people will definitely be offended by it but fans of black comedy will probably enjoy it overall this movie is not for everyones taste but most people who like black comedy will probably love it as it is definitely one of the better black comedies 710,positive,1
this movie is masterly directed by clive barker he really knows how to establish a rapport between the audience and the characters i think there is a sequel missing for this one barker should have dedicated to the sequel for this movie instead of doing the boring lord of illusions that is one i think was a real garbage but i also think that because of this and because of the lack of the sequel nbreed has become a dark cult classic of horror films,positive,1
human traffic is without a doubt the most original and compelling film that i have seen for a long time it documents 2 days in the lives of a group of young people bored with their everyday existence and dead end jobs and taking ecstasy at raves on the weekend it is hilariously funny and extremely poignant and at times very sad in the same genre as trainspotting it has a great soundtrack and features hot young rising british stars the movie was made on a miniscule budget and i look forward to future offerings of writerdirector justin kerrigan when his talent is discovered by the major movie makers,positive,1
the only reason any of the hundred or so users watched this movie was because they belong to the crew were friends to the crew or were obsessive fans of either lance henriksen or lorenzo lamas i personally follow the cult of lance so i was disappointed to see that despite being the headliner its in name only playing rich criminal newcastle lance is a joy to watch but all of his screen time is relegated to the beginning of the movie newcastle sets up a 747 heist which includes ketchum lamas and a bunch of forgettable characters the biggest shock to this viewer was that the preheist scenes were not all that bad with the exception of somewhat obnoxious and rather confused looking aviva gale who times every line with the finesse of a grade school play actress acting was decent all around and none of the lines really made me cringe  but once the heist occurs the movie falls asleep not only is their plan the most ridiculous thing ever captured on film but its dragged out for far too long this isnt a very deep movie and you have to fill out your 90 minutes but these scenes are so boring i nearly nodded off at two in the afternoon one particular sequence in which we watch each and every one of the characters perform the same task over and over again is especially difficult to get through the movies name is rapid exchange but the exchange is far from rapid  its overlong and bloated to extremes perhaps it would have worked if any of the characters had real personalities but come on theres only so much you can ask out of a straighttovideo movie airing of showtime extreme  thankfully there are several laughs intentional and unintentional lorenzo lamas is seemingly a master of disguise which makes for a couple of incredibly bizarre scenarios and lance returns in the films end albeit for a brief period of time its a bad movie and i probably didnt have to tell you that myself but its far from the worst thing ive ever seen i wouldnt put it too high on the list of henriksen films since hes been in some real gems with greater screen time and either way the movie loses a lot of steam once the heist begins but the best thing i can say for rapid exchange is that the last two films i watched before it were the mainstream hostage and the overrated pretentious crash  and this was better than both,negative,0
i watched this film for the second time tonight after about three years and it was as wonderful as before  there are more than a dozen modern stunning french films from en couer de hiver to the three colours trilogy and all of them are special this film is one of them a true delight with so many great things going for it from the homage to hitchcock to two beautiful ladies in romane and monica while monica is very beautiful romane is a very sexy lady and steals many of the scenes she inhabits  i am not sure why people think this film is convoluted as the scenes are such a perfect blend of past and present acting as a counterpoint to the characters own remarkable journey that the film simply flows and you barely realise that 116 minutes of beauty and mystery have left the viewed enchanted and bewitched   like most french and european films this story would never translate across the atlantic as no studio could capture the magic without throttling the life out of it with the hollywood bleaching common to most movies that become lost in translation americans make brilliant films but not of this type perhaps if they let someone like a young polanski work on it then maybe they would not totally butcher an english version  for those who do not watch subtitled films you will spend a lifetime in ignorant bliss for those who can read then you would be spiting yourself to miss films like this  i would describe this as neofranconoir but only to cheese off the reviewer who called this film elitist i think i saw him doing an add for fourandtwentypies he thinks romane bohringer is a type of french mayonnaiseit is arty in the way that pulp fiction is artybut with more gallic savoire faire  10 out of 10 with every viewingand has anyone got romanes phone numbershe is the perfect french salad dressing,positive,1
this was a very good movie and is absolutely unfair to judge it without taking into account the time when it was released there are some movies which do not get older but this is clearly out of date however i saw this film when i was a boy and for more than twenty years both the images as the story were unforgettable for me and most of my friends until we could appreciate it again on dvd actually i do remember this movie as the topic of several chats and meetings where old boys were talking about things we have in common therefore there was a little feeling of disappoint and even sadness when we finally had the dvd firstly there was a theory about how naives our generation was secondly i think there is something more i would asset that this movie has something which should be interesting for all the modern film makers specifically those who focus on the decaying horror genre this is the mutilation the idea which gives coherence to the film the fact of a human being mutilated produces a deeper horror than death and torture i remember how sick the sensation was when the monster rip kurts arm out and at the end when the creature bites the doctors neck to take a piece of his veins another remarkable thing is the morbid atmosphere which prevails without decaying in intensity through all the scenes no matter if the action is on a secret lab a lonely street where the man in a car is looking for a female body a striper dressing room and so on may be the reasons why it is not longer a good movie are just technical things for example in the scene of the accident and the man saving his fiancées head a more accurate work made for another and modern second unit director could be interesting same thing with all action scenes including the one of kurts arm furthermore something could be done with the monsters make up some remakes have been good i think in this case an attempt would worth while nevertheless the black and white tones should be conserved,positive,1
what why are people saying this is mind blowing just face it the ending is on of the worst endings in the history of cinematography 4 left and the whole world has ended not to mention the character 9 was a idiot the whole time he got everyone killed 1 was right the whole time if he sacrificed 9 then non of this would have happened people giving there lives for a stupid cause and for what to make it rain i admit the movie had its parts and the whole concept was fascinating but a lot of it was clichés one after another and did anybody else get this feeling that this is a lot like lord of the rings characters died for stupid reasons there was almost no character development and honestly ask yourself is it good to have only four guys left in the world its pointless and stupid it was one of the shortest movies ive ever seen and thank god how is robots turning against humans creative in any way its been done like a hundred times this movie is really stupid go see a movie thats worth watching like star trek the hangover or inglorious basterds those were good movies,negative,0
this is definitely a touching movie and a great expression of charles darwins personal struggle the movie is not only about his struggle to get his book the origin of species published but also his relationship with his oldest daughter his daughter was at start the only person in his family to approve of his views something that she as well had to pay for een more than him at times  now this is not an evolutionary propaganda film as a matter of fact i think it managed to stay very neutral a hard thing to do in my opinion of course it does not condone the way the characters was treated by the church quite the opposite actually if you need me to use the big words to shed light on this film it will be liked by deists and atheists alike but goes away from theism the movie talks about evolution and thats it  paul bettany as charles darwin was incredible of course we all may think of darwin as that old man with the funny beard but this movie centers around the man in his late 20s early 30s jennifer connelly emma darwin is great as always but the actor who impressed me was martha west as annie darwin darwins daughter definitely on of the best child actors of the decade the story is about darwin and his daughter and it is beautifully acted  except for a few jumps in time that was momentarily confusing the production of this film is pretty flawless some scenes were darwin observes nature is just marvelous and is almost like taken out of a high production national geographic documentary  i must admit though im not quite sure of why they chose creation as the title i doubt it is an irony the movie is too respectful for that well im sure theres a meaning too it just dont let it scare you away   i give this movie a 910 this is truly a great tribute to charles darwin and please give it a chance,positive,1
the movie was pretty bad its not so much a script problem its just that the movie is really boring in terms of pacing the movie just seems to plod along at a slow agonizing rate the story in san franpsycho is that theres a serial killer on the loose who is killing morally corrupt individuals maybe i read too much into it but hey its my nature apparently after the san franpsycho kills a pair of people under the golden gate bridge were introduced to one of the main characters of the film joe estevez brother of martin sheen as a curmudgeony cop named bill culp bill is currently trying to hunt down the killer seriously he doesnt have a name hes just the killer and he is trying to coerce a local news reporter named rita to help him with his investigation bill is the stereotypical hardedged cop and he threatens rita to throw her in jail for obstruction of justice anyway a few scenes pass by and suddenly rita finds a letter left by the psychopath hes a cold blooded psychopath and she has a change of heart and tells bill and his partner joe about it and help them with the investigation  the movie tries to be a taut murderthriller but sort of just fails at that its much like the movie the black dahlia it tries to be tense but it just is unbelievable in terms of that the movie tries to be serious throughout but it has scenes like where the killer masturbates obviously a fan of gore porn what with lines like ooh blood on her or something to that effect and joe estevez hitting the table going hes a cold blooded murderer i admit to chuckling more than once at the movie even though im sure it was intended to be a deadly serious movie  one of the only positive points the movie has going for it is the fact that i didnt pay money to see it huzzah netflix and its sad because i could see some good in their movies after watching the damned sure the movie had its fair share of flaws but it was enjoyable sadly though san franpsycho has nothing going for it granted it has an okay script its nothing too grand but it couldve been interesting instead what you get is a murder thriller that fails to thrill or have even vaguely enjoyable deaths also the other reviews claim that the movie has a great twist ending thats shocking apparently i was watching a different movie because by about the one hour mark i sort of figured out what was going to happen the ending didnt shock me in the least bit i would go on insulting this wreck of a movie but i dont think i will long story short this movie is a boring uninspired thriller i use that term loosely that fails to have the hitchcockian thrills that another reviewer claims to have a predictable ending bland deaths acting with all of the emotion of a plank of wood and a decent soundtrack  im sure others will try to defend this with the usual it was a low budget movie they did the best they could with such a low budget and all that other nonsense but when you get right down to it there was very little that they couldve really spent that budget on there was very little special effects work the soundtrack sounds like it mightve been recycled from hood of the living dead or the damned and its the same damn crew from those two films this movie really reminds me a lot of another low budget flick that was no good and it was called mr jingles the two are about the same quality they fail to deliver anything close to enjoyment and should fade quickly into obscurity,negative,0
as a longstanding barbra fan any posting like this will be biased that aside this film ranks as a classic it has its flaws emphasized in other postings but gives a glimpse of a time late 70s that will never be there again and is fascinating to watch unfold on screen  streisand fought hard to make this movie her own i dont think she was ever satisfied but it gives her fans a new barbra for the time with live singing a young fresh appearance and some very heavyduty acting  the story is rough but exciting and holds your interest throughout the extended one frame finale is hard for most nonbarbra fans to sit through but it speaks volumes to those who admire her talent  ,positive,1
ok firstly if your not a fan of the whole low budget horror genre then dont bother with this you really need to be a fan to get the gag  the move is basically about snakes on a train lots of them  there is an ancient curse involved and a crazy ending which i wont spoil the gore effect are full on and real icky but the movie is mainly one big gory gag about snakes scaring the hell out of a bunch of people trapped on a train  the suspense is built up well and there are some memorable and well composed scenes some of the acting is a bit hammy watch for the surf dudes but thats not really the point give this movie a go know what to expect and you wont regret it,positive,1
afterlife is about a somewhat arrogant reasonably wealthy man who discovers that his mother is dying and finds himself looking after his sister who has downs syndrome he cant be bothered with her and basically just wants to get her off his hands he has better things to do at one point he finds that he has to take her by car she doesnt like flying across the country  if that all sounds familiar to you it is probably because you have seen rainman a film far superior to its imitator afterlife that it copies the basic premise heck it nicks a few characters and even scenes too is not the fundamental problem with the film the fundamental problem is that i did not care about these characters  the brother kenny kevin mckidd is a bit of a womaniser he has a girlfriend who comes and goes in the story and who learns to like the downs syndrome sister again this is taken from rainman he is a journalist trying to get an interview with a doctor who is facing a scandal when he ends up looking after roberta the sister he doesnt have much time for her and sometimes leaves her alone for a little too long when she wanders off he becomes even angrier towards her am i spoiling anything by saying that he becomes a nicer loving person by the end of the film  roberta is not determined to be normal she is normal and wishes people would stop treating her differently she is played by paula sage an actress who does have downs syndrome and her performance is easily the best thing about the film why did the screenwriter not explore her character more well probably because that would mean the characters would get in the way of the story when we surely already know the story anyway didnt the filmmakers see the problem they were creating  for a film about a dying mother and her handicapped daughter the father is absent i think he is dead but im not sure it is surprising how little impact the film has on the emotions of the viewer the scenes are performed in such a standard dull way with such standard predictable dialogue that i found myself rolling my eyes  i have nothing against sentimentality in films but it only really works if you care about the characters here the characters are so uninteresting and twodimensional that i didnt really think there was much to care about rain man has an emotional climax but that moved me because i cared about the characters  talking of climaxes this film has a stinker there is sequence at the end of the film that starts off as an unbelievable situation and ends up in even worse territory an unforgivably cruel trick is played on the audience the sequence is designed to move the audience but ends up being horribly manipulative and offending the intelligence of the viewer audiences arent stupid and they know when the film is cheating what a cheap shot  there is not one scene in this film that has the impact it should there are a few sequences that are funny yes but when the characters talk to each other i can practically see the screenplay in front of me moving predictably and uninterestingly never hitting anything that touches the mind or the heart there are those phoney arguments that are reserved especially for the movies where the other character knows exactly what the reply is why dont supposedly realistic films not realise that in real life anger can be irrational and sometimes people cant express their emotions and they might say things that dont make sense or not be able to say anything at all all of the actors in this film deserve better material this film is not based on fact but i think a documentary on a family with a downs syndrome member would be much more interesting that way we might have had truth and emotion for some reason the characters in this film think that an emotion only involves saying something loudly and making a suitable facial expression   out of 5,negative,0
brothers with psychokinetic powers yes really duel not just for debra wingers affections but really over a secret from their childhood that left them at odds over their powers  there are surreal touches the fire brigade that act like a singing greek chorus but there is also humour wit and romance the soundtrack is great also and similar to the way american werewolf in london used every great wolf song they could get  but with fire and i dont think ill ever forget dennis quaid mmmmm dennis quaid setting his own trailer a rockin too shes a lady  priceless   best line missing from the quotes section btw  once youve had a clown you never go back  i love this movie i just ordered the dvd from the us and if the comments written by the kind of people whod be happier with legally blond 3 dont put you off  give it a try ,positive,1
darkly comic serendipity about a cosmetics saleswoman with odd ties to elvis presley running into a sea of elvis impersonators while speaking at conventions in nevadaand accidentally killing each one of them through little fault of her own kim basinger a stillattractive actress of considerable merit likes to pick quirky movies to play in but this dreadful screenplay by mitchell ganem and adammichael garber hasnt an iota of good humor the stereotypes and lowball gags are not meant to be the stuff of classic comedy but even on a shambling shameful level the picture is crude and sloppy if you do watch see if you can count how much extraneous shots there are of basinger behind the wheel of her pink cadillac hands always in the same position and a nonplussed look on her face hopefully both she and elvis were well paid no stars from ,negative,0
the first film ever made workers streaming from a factory some cycling most walking moving right or left along with melies the lumieres are both the starting point and the point of departure for cinema  with melies begins narrative fiction cinema fantasy artifice spectacle with the lumieres pure unadorned observation the truth there are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of cinema from the latter into the tired formulae of the former  but consider this short again there is nothing objective about it the film is full of action  a static inhuman scene burst into life activity and the quiet harmony of the frame is ruptured decentred from the back to right or left but never of course the front where the camera is and yet the camera stands stock still contains the energy the possible subversion subordinates it to its will the cinematograph may be a revolutionary invention but it will be used for conservative purposes  to map out the world edit it restrict it limit it  worse is the historical reality of the film these factory workers are lumiere employees the bosses are spying on their workers the unseen eye regarding his faceless minions the film therefore describes two types of imprisonment behind the gates the workers are confined in their workplace the opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom escape but they face another wall the fourth wall further confining them the first film is also the first example of cctv surveillance an image of unseen allseeing authority entrapping its servants a frightening all too prophetic movie,positive,1
it is amazing to me what passes for entertainment today maybe i am a dinosaur from the fifties and i am out of touch with todays movie going generation and apparently that is the case with regards to this movie since so many people loved it i found it foul and vulgar i havent said that about many movies in my life but this one fits the bill the humor is sophomoric and crude i am not a politically correct person and even i found the gay jokes not only not funny but downright offensive  im not gay the main character in the movie is not even a likable person just pathetic when the movie was finally over i heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just pay good money to see,negative,0
if you get a chance to get a hold of this lost for many years gem i doubt you will be disappointed ps has an odd blend of social satire and ultracool blaxploitation even hints of slapstick but its so odd that it was not only ahead of its time nothing has been seen like it since  i strongly disagree with people who say that the film is dated especially with spike lees bamboozaled sp a few years back which was a misfire of trying to capture the same message good filmmaking disjointed script  robert downys direction is brilliant allowing many of his actors to improvise the film gets better as it goes along and the jokes swagger from hit or miss oneliners that are as forgiven as those found in a mel brooks comedy to sheer nonpc i cant believe they just said that fun  favorite parts the commercials the film switches from gritty black and white depictions of the ad agency to beautiful perhaps 16mm color and gets away with it   i refuse to hint at any spoilers but if you get the chance to see the dvd version be sure and watch the downey interview but leave it until after the movie   my vote 1010 most underrated film of the late 60s early 70s thank you prince,positive,1
eh i watch this movie in class because someone taped it and brought it in i was expecting some half hearted attempt to portray the herakles myths and because the commercials for it looked serious i was expecting something that was halfway decent  ten minutes into the film i realized that it was utter crap the only things in the film that are halfway true to the myth are the bareand i mean bare minimum parents half brother and labors seemed to be named correctly other than that the rest of the film seemed to be one giant inaccuracy   i would say that this was not much better than the disney version of the film the disney version was made for little kids therefore wasnt too serious this movie with all the sex violence and nudity was clearly intended for an older audience yet the story presented in this was nearly inaccurate as the disney film,negative,0
in watching this off and on for a few seasons two things come to mind one  wondering what kind of girl wants to be a model and two  run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat sundae  i tried to be a fan because i liked the idea of this reality show competition no other famous model thought of this and it is very admirable for tyra banks to do so but as the series goes on and on ive come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a molehill women shouldnt watch this teens should stay clear of it unless theyre doing book reports on the subject  many women try out for slots to compete for americas next top model they live together cat fight together cry together get put through pointless modeling shoots with pointless modeling people and fashionatas and get eliminated and almost all of them claim you will see me again heck im trying to see what happened to the ones that did win actually  this is the dream of some girls and good for them in watching this i hope the other girls that see this and run like hades the other way  like to college  i just happened to watch more of this recent season because of the ploy of full figured models joining the group that even made me think more of this as a sorry lot of folks the full figured models were no more than average sized ladies competing with what i think is the thinnest group of models they ever chose  so of course that would make them look even fatter  a ploy fashionatas use all the time bad bad tyra and crew  but to be fair americas next top model is not about full figured models its about projecting an imagined image a beauty that can be mass marketed and sold as the ultimate in beauty  and this show is just looking for the next fresh piece of meat to add to the mix hence the name of the show hence the sorry lot of judges photographers associations hence tyra and her consistent this was me plugs every camera angle you can get but then again that is the one thing i like about this show  the exmodel giving others who wouldnt have the chance  a chance to enter the doors but after thateverything else is status quo for that industry which is why there are no surprises or week to week interest in the program,negative,0
this is the second movie based on the life and times of ultra hung porn star john curtis estes better known as john holmes boogie nights is also roughly based on his life maybe someday someone is going to do a movie on the life of tommy byron instead  the problem is that the story is not very well told there are many law  order episodes that have more twists and turns than wonderland and the director never gets the criminal case going with any kind of gusto val kilmer has two problems  he is not nearly as hung as holmes is and no prosthesis this time around unlike in boogie nights and he is much better looking than mope holmes   the director does not introduce one single likable individual among the cast the racist immature lowlifes he hangs out with or his wife and the police dont get much in the way of characterization   the best part of the movie is eric bogosian telling paris hilton to get lost   having said all that anyone interested in the sleaziest side of the porn business in the 1980s or true crime shouldnt miss it,positive,1
the information contained in this movie is somewhat familiar to many who have been paying attention to the news lately the walter reed scandals show a small part of the fact that we are not doing a good job taking care of our injured heroes when they return  what this movie further shows is a truth common to all wars the psychological trauma that soldiers suffer while engaging in war and the difficulty they have when returning to civilian life they are not just changed or affected they are different people and most do not know how to deal with that as they do not know themselves  finally this film shows what the military does to our young men in women in getting them ready for war and the policies and practices that they have to follow in prosecuting war that leads to all the psychological trauma  we have over 3000 dead soldiers in the four years of this invasion but we have many tens of thousands that will suffer lifelong physical and psychological trauma because of this war it doesnt matter what side you are on it behooves you to know the cost of war to decide if we should be in that business this film illustrates the costs to the men and women perfectly,positive,1
first i am not really a fan of the whole things eating flesh in disgusting new ways genre of film but i am a bad movie afficionado so my next door neighbor said he had the worst movie ever this one so we start watching it first and foremost  it is recorded on a camcorder sans tripod second the voice of the skinny white doctor is dubbed by a large black man third none of the dialogue makes any sense fourth the zombie scenes though unconvincing and chockful of poor makeup and tomato paste lead me to believe the director and my next door neighbor are in need of psychological help its funny for about 5 minutes but it gets old fast its so amateurish its like watching a poorly dubbed high school video yearbook with zombies a note to anyone involved with this movie  i want the 20 minutes of my life i spent watching this before i fell asleep back,negative,0
an old high school teacher of mine used to brag that hed seen every movie ever made so one day a friend of mine and i decided to make up a movie called pacific inferno later we got into an argument whether the lead role was played by carl weathers or billy dee williams our teacher found the argument interesting so he came up to us and informed us that the lead role in pacific inferno was played by jim brown we thought he was trapped in a lie that was until we went to the library and discovered that pacific inferno was in fact a real movie this incident forced me to rent the movie its horrible our made up movie had a better plot than this piece weathers and billy dee would have been much better in the picture,negative,0

i really really liked this one i know its rampant with what are now cliché plot lines and plenty of overacting but it was hell of a lot of fun  in our quest for 70s and 80s horror cheese we come across many flicks that are so bad theyre good we also have some that are so good they suck and then we have some that are so bad they are just bad this is definitely so bad its good  some teens traveling come across an oasis in the middle of nowhere a forgotten slice of roadside america and they decide to check it out they cross every line of inappropriate until it is absurd and they pay for it they pay dearly  i would not normally give a movie like this a 9 but the girls in this one are the type that we miss from the 1970s ditzy scantilyclad and fit these arent the anorexic broads from todays horrible horror they look awesome in booty shorts  i give it a 9 out of 10 kids,positive,1
a few of my fellow writers have covered this movies plot elements so i will stick to some of the cuff remarks  1 this is entertaining  but not for the reasons youd think its cheesy but somehow still watchable  2 tamra daniels love interest has to be about thirty the christian girl that dan ignores is way cuter  3 muriel stole his shirt from mr spock also if my guardian angel looks like muriel im going to have to apply for a transfer  4 okay so apparently dan is responsible for his parents divorce what kind of horrible guilt trip is that muriel says that it was dans prayers that kept his parents together i just thought that was absolutely ridiculous listen i can pray for my parents as much as i want but the only way theyll stay together is if they decide theyre going to do it  5 ill echo the atheists comments on how this movie portrays nonchristians apparently theyre all slovenly bullies  6 for something positive  david white is a decent actor he gives the movie a little bit of credibility even if he is the only one he pretty much holds this film together on his own,negative,0
24 is the best television show its an incredible tv series with an incredible suspense excellent plots and unforgettable characters and the first episode of all is my best evidence because its only the first episode only the introduction and you are hooked because of the plot and the continuous twists and turns  jack bauer is a federal agent who is assigned the protection of the senator david palmer he cant trust in anybody because people of the ctu may be involved and when this events occurred his daughter kimberly escapes from house to a party but  at the end of the episode you want to watch more and more and more   its only the first of the lot and its excellent,positive,1
would anyone really watch this rubbish if it didnt contain little children running around nude from a cinematic point of view it is probably one of the worst films i have encountered absolutely dire some perv woke up one day and thought i will make a film with little girls in and call it art stick them in countryside and there isnt any need for a story or explanation of how they got there or why they dont appear to live anywhere or have parents because prn films dont need anything like that i would comment on the rest of the film but i havent ticked spoilers so i will just say avoid avoid avoid and find yourself a proper film to watch,negative,0
the only riddle in this film was how it ever got made the british film industry needs to make films people actually want to watch and not look to get taxpayers money ala bbc to keep luvvies in their life style they have been accustomed to with doing nothing for it  the film was every thing wrong with british films it relied on stereotypes it had to be about a london were people were either posh and corrupt gangsters luvvies or gawd blimey jellied eel types the story script was just pathetically weak to the extent when the police man pulled out his phone and the ring tone was the sweeney  theme i just expected it the whole film was a happy shopper sweeney  minder rip off  the priceless manuscript i noted got left behind and lost on a few occasions and is something even i with my limited street wiseness wouldnt carry around in my breast pocket every where to the beach and fights etc saying that vinnie jones is likable which is about the only thing in the film poor bloke  when derek jacobi walked into the water at the end because he was dickens oh my god what a load of crap and i am being positive here,negative,0
poorly acted and poorly directed congo unsuccessfully tries to recreate the feeling of jurassic park but the truth is the book wasnt all that great either still the movies first problem is that tim currys character was added the second problem is that the talking arm was added the main problem though is that the cast members dont create realistic characters i guarantee that this movie will not make you think that there are killer gorillas anywhere on earth also starring laura linney happy birthday laura dylan walsh ernie hudson grant heslov joe don baker james karen and bruce campbell im guessing that they dont wish to emphasize this movie in their resumes,negative,0

i loved adrianne curry before this show i thought she was great on top model and was really glad when she won i also liked chris knight he seems like a great guy but this show just made me sick im so angry at both of them for what happened on that show i dont care that they were different ages i know age cant stand between love but adrianne you had been together for only seven months it didnt surprise me at all that he hadnt proposed and i dont see the appeal of forcing someone to marry you before theyre ready if its meant to be then why not just enjoy each others company and love each other and let it come naturally turning a wedding ring into a ball and chain was completely unnecessary its stupidly obvious that chris loves you with or without a ring and chris shame on you for breaking down and proposing to her anyway youve been through two failed marriages how could you rush into another one just because she pitched a fit i hope the relationship lasts but i really feel that the marriage was rushed and for all the wrong reasons maybe now they can take a breath and find the right reasons to be married from within the marriage,negative,0
opening scene explains why hurt is later immune to the contaminated man too bad it doesnt explain anything else how did he get whatever he caughtwhat was itwhy does it work so fast then we go to present day budapest ok was the opener in the past or the future it turns out to be the past of course but for a minute it looks just as likely to be the nd of the movie moved to the beginning sorry i should have paid closer attention huh or maybe its just badly done then a lot of confusion about the different jobs hes had in related fields and finally a mention about how he should have died from the original experiment the n s a did on him aha so the n s a and private industry got together to poison one of their top guys to watch the effects he must have been one of the top guys hes friends with the c e o of the chemical company for god sakes then theres the substance itself technically a poison but it mutates in immune carriers so we can have whatever we want a poison a disease an allergic reaction all very different things in real life magically its not contagious from one dying victim to another only from the carrier how convenient then theres the h a z m a t protocol they jump into a situation without having any idea whats in store or how prepare for it did the producers not have enough money to show a proper washdown after the crew just left the scene of a deadly unknown substance i kept thinking hurt was going to die from bad cleanup technique and the open scene would turn out to be the closer after all,negative,0
im sorry to see that it has been rated that low by many people the series started off very good and after the first season it wasnt that good  people tend to forget the beginning of something and only look at the end this is not good to do you should look at the total not the end result it is sad that a lot of the usual characters died but damn we had a lot of nice new characters  please do not attach yourself to a few characters but attach yourself to the series the plot please do understand that i didnt like it when boone died when augur died but well it needs to be done can you imagine that everyone keeps living the whole series when they are in a lot of danger all the time come on face it if they didnt die they would be invincible in this way you will always keep the tension will he survive will he die i do realize that people attach their selves to characters i do that too my favorite character was augur the one who could get into every computer he wanted he was the one who was mysterious he could do things with the computer no one else could do  i wish to make one statement to all the people who vote negative does a series which started so good deserve to have such low rating should we look at the final season instead of the total should we not see how good the series was when it started should we not see how much we enjoyed it,positive,1

i picked this dvd up for 399 at rogers video in order to get enough points to get a better movie for free i never actually was planning on watching this but it started poking at my curiosity and i finally decided to pop in it the dvd player the effects in this movie are horrible and cheap some of the dialog in this movie sounds like it was written by a swear happy 12 year old boy the acting is really cheesy in some parts and the action scenes are completely laughable youll burst out laughing at some parts which was a positive for me because it kept me mildly entertained the plot is some girl has a curse on her which causes her to vomit snakes so some shaman has to get her to los angeles there are also two girls trying to smuggle drugs there and a few other people that are unimportant to the plot not that there really is a plot at alldont expect anything from this movie and dont listen to the cover there are not 100 passengers and 3000 vipers there are 10 passengers and 20 random snakes  as for the dvd there is a trailer which is almost as laughable as the film a blooper reel which is just one shot over and over of one actor trying to say train and the deleted scenes are really pointless if they werent good enough to stay in this movie they must be pretty bad there is also a really bad making of featurette which doesnt really show much at all except that the people involved with this movie were kind of idiots i cant recommend it unless you want a really bad movie that you can laugh at with friends i give it 2 kitty cats out of 5,negative,0
in the eighties savage steve holland put out three movies two of which are classics of what seems to be a very small genre absurdist teen comedies the third how i got into college does not measure up to better off dead and this one mainly because of its lack of john cusack and curtis armstrong except for a tiny cameo  one crazy summer is an underrated movie with lots of great characterizations and gags as i recall savage steves movies were vilified as being brain dead at the time and after three movies he drifted into childrens tv we could use more movies from the likes of him,positive,1
this is just one more of those hideous films that you find on lifetime tv which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic manner along with other such nasty films as the burning bed enough or monster this film takes a disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why shes not such a bad person after all give us a break heres my question to the filmmakers if letourneau were a man and vili were a 12 year old girl would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person answer hell no  imagine switching the genders in this film and then youll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage were the genders switched there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal instead wed likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man preying upon a young girl his lascivious behavior landing him in prison and his brainwashed victim suffering from stockholm syndrome the only reason letourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sex  lets call a spade a spade letourneau is a pedophile plain and simple no ifs ands or buts shes a criminal who belongs in prison and deserves our derision and contempt but certainly not our pity or empathy,negative,0

i do not fail to recognize hanekes aboveaverage filmmaking skills for example i appreciate his lingering on unremarkablenaturaldaylighted settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism however regarding the content of this film i am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to pathologize dominationsubmission relations or feelings andor bdsm practices the problem that the main character has with her mother is unbelievably topical as is the alienation and uncomprehension felt by walter i dont mean the frustration of a lover which is not loved back in the same way which is understandable i mean that he looks upon her as if she were crazy or as if he was a monk come on i mean ds is not something new in the world and i think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something freakish or pathological it isnt in general films dealing with this subject are really lagging behind the times  so for me i feel that this film ends up being quite a programmatical film worried with very outdated psicoanalitical theories isnt it nearly embarrassing and that does not really relate with reallife lives and experiences of those engaged in ds relationships personal experience forums irc chatrooms even recent scholar studies will show this,negative,0
unfortunately ive never seen the full version of this movie i did see the 87minute version twice back in the 1950s even more floridly directed than is the norm with julien duvivier this is a wonderfully outoftheordinary piece replete with sweeping tracking shots through over and into andrejews magnificently atmospheric sets beautifully lit too by photographer andré thomas black jack is nothing if not a connoisseurs delight reinforcing this imaginative visual style is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors including agnes moorehead and marcel dalio some brilliantly bizarre fullblooded characterizations george sanders gives a polished performance whilst an eccentric millionairess who turns out to be a rival racketeer is admirably played by agnes moorehead also realizing the most from her role patricia roc the film was made on locations in spain in 1949,positive,1

evidently not many people have seen this movie because no one is posting any more comments this is not a movie to be missed after all it has won the george peabody award as well as the humanitas award paul winfield should have won an award for his awesome performance in this movie eugene logan who was a cowriter on this made for tv movie also was part of another movie on humanity or loss of it by being a technical adviser to truman capotes movie the glass house this movie is now available on dvd if anyone is interested i will post another letter telling how it was that eugene logan came to be the technical adviser to a movie of such an amazing person as truman capote thanks for reading this and i hope you will find a way to view these two movies,positive,1
i can only assume the previous posts came from execs at the production company  attended the uk premiere last night zane and brook attended they probably knew i was gonna be there and are undoubtedly stars but what a turkey of a film i felt sorry for them at times when the audience erupted in laughter at what were serious thriller scenes  but perhaps i was missing the point perhaps an element of tongueincheek was intended if so pure genius if not career genocide  on the plus side zane always shines and brook can actually act a little as the other half said as we ran out the cinema avec broken ribs they can be forgiven for this film as they both seem like nice people the scriptwriter however should be marooned,negative,0
when i saw the first preview for this i nearly passed out from excitement i have long been a fan of twelfth night it turned me on to shakespeare so to have a modern adaption is a dream come true my anticipation was not disappointed  the plot basically follows the original storyline and that means complicated i dont want to even try to relate it the plot summery will probably cover the basics just imagine having a girl pretend to be a guy at a boarding school and think of all the possible situations that would create i will not even pause to question the plausibility of such a plot reality is not the point of the film  what it is though is absolutely hilarious nearly every scene nails the comedic setup kudos to the writers director and actors on that count  amanda bynes is the star of this film and she carries it wonderfully shes supercute not a vixen and can do faultless comedy i admire her so much for not going fullon tramp in her films or public life like so many starlets today do im glad there is at least one decent young actress left in hollywood ok im off my soapbox  channing tatum yeah hes hot and built like a flippin gorilla but he really makes me laugh my favourite scenes in the whole movie are when hes trying to converse with olivia first by talking about cheese and then later about his workout regimen  the rest of the cast did not fail to perform either with marvelous additions to the characters in the forms of the inane débutante mother and monique the classic evil girlfriend  overall lots of fun loooots of laughs and a highly attractive cast maybe not on par with the original but it beats out modern versions of other plays including the muchtouted 10 things i hate about you,positive,1
i just saw this movie and i have to say that it was a big waste of time the girl who played eva ellen fjaestad cant act at all she read her lines very unnaturally and she had a very unnatural facial expression through the entire movie rosanna munter who played petra on the other hand is a natural she played her part with great perfection  spoilers the story was simple  weve seen it many many times before she breaks up he finds another she get jealous he breaks up with the other girl and they end up back together in the end there were no surprises at all one knew that eva would break up and that adam would hook up with petra the only thing that nobody saw coming was that petra told adam to go after eva at the party she became all serious which is a side of petra the viewers hadnt seen earlier in the movie and told him to win evas heart back which was really cute  besides rosanna munter there isnt a single actor who gives a memorable performance  this is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors so i dont recommend it,negative,0
there is only one reason this movie is watchable till schweiger he is such a good actor the movie isnt completely terrible uwe boll please take up another career the special effects and action are acceptable all other aspects were very disappointing all i can say is that kevin smith an evening with talked about tim burton not ever reading the batman comics and it showed uwe boll must not have ever played the video games that he keeps making movies about if you two ever want to know how it is done go see andrzej bartkowiak doom was one of the best video games to film adaptations ever some people may disagree but if you watch the movie you can see that the guys at id had a lot to do with doom it doesnt seem like anyone at ubisoft was even near this production,negative,0
this movie was not that good at all here is the first clue and that it is not gonna be a strong movie harrison fords name not only appears first but it is also bigger than the title the music was nominated for an oscar what the heck was that that music was probably the most annoying thing in the movie the acting was sub par at best except the amish boy he did a decent job for being so young then you have the story which was weak and a little over the place and it won for adapted the music was horrid i know i already said something but it was really bad the premises was real good and it should be remade well thats all i really have on that  your average movie guy  trever,negative,0
in new york in a morning close to christmas an upper class father and mother go in their bmw to a private school to see the play of their daughter then they go shopping and later they return to their fancy apartment in manhattan in the night they move to a simple apartment in a dangerous neighborhood where they prepare drugs for distribution on the christmas eve while buying the christmas gift for their daughter the father is kidnapped and his wife desperately tries to raise a high amount of money to pay the requested ransom r xmas is a deceptive movie of abel ferrara the lead characters do not have names are anonymous and maybe his intention is to tell that in the breast of a neighbor family in your building may have drug dealers or that drug dealers may also have families and may be loving persons or that there are many dirty cops probably worse than the criminals or is it a simple apology to crime whatever however this humanization of criminals is a horrible message and i really did not like this movie in brazil for example many drug dealers and criminals help their communities due to the absence of the state in poor areas and slums but this procedure does not make them model citizen in this movie we see a loving upper class family in the day providing drugs as means of living but the destruction of the members of other families is not shown in the story and it is impossible to feel sympathy for any characters in the end i wished all of them dead my vote is four  title brazil gangues do gueto gangs of the ghetto,negative,0
dressed to kill has been more or less forgotten in critical circles in the past 20 years but it is a true american classic a film which is much more than just a glossy thriller  i sincerely hope the dvd release will give more people the chance to hear about it and see it,positive,1
how come ive never seen or even heard about this junkmovie before its right up my alley with bloody teenkill laughable plotting and an irresistible 80s cheeseatmosphere hanging around it for some reason nobody is really interested in the staff and students of an elite catholic university are butchered by an unknown psychopath freshly recruited teacher julie parker becomes involved when all the people she has contact with either turn up dead or behave strangely this movie is hilariously bad theres absolutely no logic or coherence and every character is equally meaningless to the others for example theres a girl killed and her body dumped in a container then and for no reason the story suddenly moves forward three weeks yet the murdered girl is never mentioned or even missed not even by her boyfriend the acting is pitiful and there isnt even a bit of nudity to enjoy the revelation of the killer is quite funny because the makers really seemed convinced that it was an original twist its not guys splatter university is easily one of the worst horrorturkeys ever,negative,0
this is what i call a pre sci fi sci fi movie it gets no better than lugosikarloff in this incredibly good mood type motion picture these two genuine artists are at their very best as is the story line  karloff does an amazing job as a scientist that sees himself caught in a vise of vanity pride and scientific competition i was caught up in the idea of watching a man as he drowns himself in the three previously mentioned concepts i was saddened and at the same time fascinated with the two stars as they do themselves in   this is the sort of motion picture that begs for a remake this time put harrison ford in the karloff part and maybe kieffer sutherland as the bela lagosi role it might be possible to do it almost as good  this is one of the very best that hollywood ever produced as i saidit gets no better no way,positive,1
after waking up at 330 in the morning and not being able to go to sleep i decided that i may as well be entertained while i suffered from sleep deprivation this movie was on hbo and i decided to watch it what a mistake  here is the plot potential spoilers if you even care  a neurotic man with an addiction to candy josh kornbluth works as a temp for some ridiculous company suddenly he is offered the chance to go perm which seems to be the favorite catchphrase of this movie but with a secure job and a secure income within his grasp josh decides for whatever stupid reason that he doesnt want to do it he hopelessly bungles several minor tasks and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt his inability to send several very important letters within a given amount of time is supposed to be hilarious but is merely stupid josh meets and deceives a lawyer woman and they wind up in bed together obviously a fantasy of joshs in real life as such a thing would never happen a bunch of other stuff happens but its too trite and inane to go into now  despite the fact that this movie is billed as a comedy i only laughed twice during it the first time was the opening shot of josh kornbluth my initial reaction was one of stifling fear and the second was when he was in bed with the attractive woman yeah right josh kornbluth is perhaps the most terrifyinglooking person i have ever seen in my life he is an unattractive overweight balding jewish man who i am supposed to believe has sex with beautiful women i do not at all sympathize with joshs character he is lazy and unmotivated and i just dont appreciate the failed attempts at humor skip it even if your life depends upon it,negative,0
i am speechless matty simmons has managed to do something i thought impossible he has made the harlem globetrotters on gilligans island look like citizen kane painful cannot even begin to describe this piece of i dont know mind you the premise sounded funny but now that ive seen it its funny in the way that dropping an anvil on your scrotum is funny  i wont bother to describe the premise as the title says it all if only to say i dont think there was literally one funny thing in this film not one not even the monkey bite how could one of the funniest characters in the vacation franchise the sleazy white trash eddie randy quaid be made so horrifically unfunny  i never felt so much sympathy for an actor in my life i equally pitied the other actors participating in this comedic atrocity miriam flynn catherine eddies long suffering but sunnydispositioned wife dana barron the original audrey griswold fred willard and the stunning sung hi lee perhaps the only reason to watch the film if only with the sound off save for that old commie ed asner uncle nick he had it coming alas the audience didnt i only say thank heavens that chevy chase who has been in a slump for years steered clear of this diarrhea splatter its the smartest career move he ever made  i dont know if you folks are religious like i am but i know ill be praying to the lord tonight to add 2 hours if not 2 years to my life to make up for the time i spent in front of the television that ill never get back otherwise  hot water burn baby says zero out of 10 stars if you take a few hits off the bong and drink the water maybe 110th of a star out of 10,negative,0
it is hard to imagine anyone making a tom cruise film look good hard indeed but this one makes him look good very good actually it makes him look like sir john gielgud celebrating very good acting day with a bravura performance  the acting from the entire ensemble struggled to rise above the risible and failed the fault was in part let us be fair that the plot bore as much resemblance to the hg wells original as did the butchered carcasses of the human victims in the film to their living predecessors both were bloodied and violated remnants of more attractive predecessor but to describe a plot such as this to be a bit holy is to say of the colander my this kitchen utensil has a remarkable lot of holes unless that is holes are your bag in which case this film will commend itself to you  the fault in the other part was that these were demotivated jobbing dvd actors who knew full well one assumes that this was their exhibition that would wind up on the 5 dvd shelf and overpriced at that  so should you watch it why yes of course you should you are a miserable sinner and deserve punishment,negative,0
too predictable for spoilers but ill not be cagey below so dont read it if you care  a few dull scriptwriters together for half an afternoon and even then they run out of ideas so lets start with a criminal sought by all francedoesnt matter what he has done well think of that later they dont some seconds of suspense but not too much and nothing unexpected because that requires art half an hour needed to finish off the film i get it have them rob a jewellers and take a lot of time avoiding alarms etc everybody robs jewellers in films just ike this its bound to work it doesnt no humour no character ok yves montand does get to ham it a weeny bit and have everyone speak in a quiet deadpan voice that is supposed to make one think of noir but merely makes the actors sound depressed if they are silent itll make them seem grimmer  but also save us writing their lines wed better add something for the stay at home women who are going to watch this stuff so lets have something to make them empathise with hubby we forgot to put any women in the film got it a son on gasp marijuana  oh and have him attempt suicide for no particular reason shame his dads a mafia boss for crying out loud but the audience will feel his fatherly care and if not sod them oh the crooked cop was a classmate of the guy who gets him in the end wrenching eh lets have them all die at the end or well never finish this stuff is it in the can right thats over with then thank god wholl we get for director,negative,0
i was surprised at how fascinating this movie was the performances were extremely good especially by rea as the compassionate nononsense detective  despite a low budget no big fx or flashy camerawork citizen x somehow manages to surpass the majority of similar big hollywood films by just telling the story  true stories tend to end with a whimper rather than a bang and thats the case here but apart from that this is a highly recommended detective yarn,positive,1
i decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site i would have to say it was worth the effort however you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes if you dont have the staying power get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights  now to the film what i say will contain spoilers and if you dont mind here goes   alexandre is a promiscuous bum a womanizer and a gigolo he lives with an older woman called marie marie owns a retail shop and she provides for alex alex spends his days at cafés and restaurants the story reveals that alex had previously impregnated gilberte whom he used to live with gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because alex had abused and battered her at this point alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else   by chance alexandre meets a nurse nymph called veronika and they striked up a relationship veronika fell in love with alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past marie and veronika struggles for alexs affection and had a ménage à trois to boot finally at the end its revealed veronika is pregnant with alexs child and alex asked her to marry him we assume as aforesaid with gilbertes situation alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family there is hope   with the title of la maman et la putain i deduce jean eustache was relating to françoise lebruns character of veronika she was a whore and then she became the mother hence the mother and whore is the same person anyway what do i know french films are mostly not all very chatty aimlessly political preaching theatrical insipid lamenting and full of quotes lebrun and léaud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed   not a bad effort 710,positive,1
before i review this film i must make a confession that is rather a bold statement to make as a film reviewer anyone who has already read any of my previous reviews may know that ive always been controversial in a lowkey sense giving high marks for flops such as captain america and 1985s creature and panning such film classics as alistar sims a christmas carol and shakespeare in love with that in mind this confession might not come as a surprise  the simple fact is christopher lambert is probably one of my favorite actors woah now dont start getting crazy on me just yet let me explain myself i by no means think hes the greatest actor in the world i clearly confess that he is not he is certainly no morgan freeman or anthony hopkins but i would say that his acting ability is probably somewhere up there with at least bruce willis what i admire about him however are the human qualities that he brings into his action heroes he is just an average guy who laughs and cries and bleeds who is a hero because he has to be not necessarily because he wants to be it takes a lot in my opinion to be able to bring out those qualities in a character especially in the movies hes worked in and lamberts heroes are a far cry from schwartzenneggers or stallones quite frankly lamberts characters are easier for me to relate to hence hes not the greatest actor in the worldhes just a personal favorite  i cant say that same however for his films however much i appretiate his acting it would be foolish not to confess that his choice of films leave something to be desired most of them are quite frankly terrible and any ridicule that hes gotten over the years from me isnt due to his acting but rather his bad choice in scripts  with that in mind i can say that his debut film tarzan is one of his best films and probably his greatest performance as i mentioned it is effective becasue of the humaness he brings to the role and for how seriously the director writers and actors handle the material this is a far leap from the bmovie action adventures with johnny weismeller from the 1940s in fact i would hesitate to call it an action movie instead it is a serious drama that takes all of er burroughs material seriously showing tarzans quest to discover his real family in scotland after realizing that he doesnt fit in as a white ape he is torn in between his old family and his new one which includes a wonderful sir ralph richardson in his final role in an attempt to adapt to humans his ape instincts also kick in and he cant decide what he loves more his real family or the one that hes always known all in all it is a wonderful commentary on society and a wonderful character study  if nothing else it launched lambert into international stardom which continued will into the 1980s with films like highlander and he sicilian unfortunately it didnt last but just wait a whilehis latest career moves such as gideon and resurrection have proven that though he still have a long way to go hes a competent enough actor to be able to perhaps make a ahem comeback if hell just pick his roles better  for now however heres the verdict on his first film   out of ,positive,1
this film almost gave me a nervous breakdown when i was recovering from appendicitis a few years ago i had just started teaching in secondary high school the whole teaching business was all a bit nervewracking for a beginner but to mentally prepare myself for going back into the classroom i decided to watch some rather awful films the flintstones was one of the films that i chose and then i put king of the streets the uk title of alien warrior on just before it finished i found myself almost in tears at the sheer waste of it allmy life the film stock the £2 i had paid for it a couple of weeks ago in the blockbuster ex rental section the time it must have taken to print the sleeve art the effort of the editors and musicians involved in the soundtrack as negligable as their efforts werethe list goes on  i love bad films let me make this perfectly clear  i love watching crappy films from blockbusters me and my mate dan used to sit and watch many many cheapjack horrors and laugh at them but this was a different type of crappy film i dont think that anything has come close to this not even tobe hoopers death trap which is probably my second worst film in the world the whole making a car from abandoned parts section nearly killed me the repetition of music at any available opportunity regardless of onscreen events the whole aaaggghhhhhhh i cant even carry on with this critical dissection as my gag reflex has started the futility of that film even now three years after i watched it for the first and last time still renders me speechless but i am still able to type the whole making a car from odd parts section had me contemplating horrible things  i implore you if you are interested in watching this film just gaze at the cover of the video and imagine the worst possible version of the story synopsis on the back i can almost guarantee that it wont be even half as bad as this film actually is dont under any circumstances contemplate actually watching it for any reason whatsoever not if you are a christian and you want to see a christ allegory not if you are a bad movie afictionado and you want to experience the true nadir of trash not even if you want your life to seem longer and believe me every second that this film runs seems like at least a minute make no mistake about it this film is unholy it is the antichrist in video form as bo cattlett in get shorty said ive seen better film on teeth,negative,0
i normally love jackie chan movies but this one was terrible there are only 2 or 3 fight scenes all of which are up to normal standard more or less the bad thing about this movie is it focuses a lot on car chasingracing the car chase isnt so bad though not as exciting as fighting but the car racing at the end is exceptionally boring basically it takes all of things that make a jackie chan film a jackie chan film and leaves out everything except jackie chan even the traditional outtakes at the end lack their usual humour  i suppose to a certain extent it was made worse by the fact i saw one of those horrible dubbed versions i usually try to see the subtitled versioni wish i could understand chinese  ive only seen one jackie film worse that this one and that was one of his early forays into hollywood films that didnt turn out so well  avoid unless really curious or a lover of motor sports,negative,0
again like many other tv shows a certain actoractresses in thrust into the limelight in this case miranda cosgrove having built up her reputation in previous moviesseries especially by nickelodeon and dan schneider she is now the star of the show gets to sing the soundtrack  which she did not write and thus gets even more fame from that wonderful it creates as much imbalance in popularity vs her other costars especially nathan kress who is continually thrust into minor rolls in each episode except idont want to fight cosgroves music would never have met the charts without this show and her singing the main theme song which was not written by her and other covers such as about you now and stay my baby lets not forget that she lip syncsings her song live too is that how you create vocalist nowadays  back to the show cosgrove reveals more physically by acting scenes in a bikini hawaiian hula type bra and mentioned bra many times through out bras and seen in many cases though not of the other actresses wedgies are mentioned panties have been mentioned once og let us not forget oh my god a come phrase are any of the scriptwritersactors christian granted that the show is not meant to be just for kids im surprised at the multitude of mentions of the female undergarment especially in the first episode where the phrase pointy boobs were mentioned im not sure whether kids would thus refrain from saying that at homein school afterwards   its not that im against the mentioning or showing of female undergarments which girls will wear but for a show from nickelodeon the people in charge should have realised that kids would get the exposure to such stuff i doubt that other nickelodeon shows have such content in them  as mentioned is other reviews the laughter track is extremely annoying and unnecessary in many partsfor example when the character sam cries how on earth is that a time to laugh it distracts people from getting the joke and is used almost in every sentence  as mentioned cosgrove is made the star of the show and thus gains the utmost fame and support from die hard fans who even scolded a hotel staff when she is told to keep her noise level down see httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvkk0gtfuk98u jennette mccurdy is the second star of the show but she faces competition from cosgrove in the music industry compare the popularity of her new single vs cosgroves covers as noted the third costar nathan kress is the least noted of the lot he is portrayed as a atypical boy who suffers the brunt of bullying by a girl and other boys but somehow a wizard at technology his height in early episodes make him a cute actor but unusual given his characters crush on carlycosgrove beyond that kress isnt breaking into the music industry and as cosgroves fame grows with each episode kress falls behind i would bet that he is the least paid of all the three actors  the content of the show is of course fictional but also lets one wonder how it fits into a comedy series at certain times thus the laughter track is usedit also contains several continuity errors how can your father be and air force colonel on a submarine us special forces have their own branches and the air force doesnt use us submarinesthat is for seals a unique feature is that of allowing viewers to submit their own videos to be shown during or after the episodes but again the videos somehow do not meet the theme of comedy  once again it is a show that is riddled with mentions of the female undergarments exposure of skin and over used laughter tracks it is a series which thrusts a teen actress so far into the crowd such that her songsactions are excessive supported by her fans leaving her co stars behind,negative,0
first this film is not a thriller neither is it gripping taut it might have been so based on the script but the directions slow pace makes it difficult to get into  the plot itself is very interesting and ingenious unfortunately we only get a sense of how ingenious after the picture is over that leaves us with over two hours of long sequences with music playing over them punctuated by some action scenes that dont grab the viewer and cunning vixen scenes that inject a little more overt intelligence  i wish this had been the fastpaced thriller the box promised it wouldve been an outstanding film instead spike lee made it plod along through the end,negative,0

the great james cagney topbilled in big letters doesnt show up till the movies second third and probably has less screen time than dudley digges who plays the eeevill reformschool potentate but when jimmy arrives as a deputy commissioner of somethingorother out to reform reform schools he slashes the air with his hands and jumps on the balls of his feet and spits out punchy warnersfirst national dialogue with all the customary and expected panache the psychology in this crisp antique one of warners many efforts to assert its place as the socially conscious studio doesnt run deep digges is bad just because the script requires him to be and theres the quaint notion that juvenile delinquents will turn into swell kids if theyre just given a dash of autonomy but its made in that spare fast style that the studio specialized in and it never bores frankie darro who got into all kinds of onscreen trouble during a brief tenure as warners favorite rotten street kid is an ideal jd  a handsome charismatic toughie with a pug nose and a hatefilled stare that could wither steel no kid actor today can touch him,positive,1
i had never thought the standard of yashraj films would ever degrade to such an extent the film has a nonsense storyline which catches no interest  saif has over acted kareena has improved her figure but is not a good actress anyway akshay is good anil is also good may i say the role wasnt good  great deal of cheapness is filled in wondered if that was supposed to be the comedy part of the movie just because last few movies were flops does that mean yashraj films should make this kind of rubbish it has a history of so many good films   overall i was totally disappointed with the movie,negative,0
being belgian myself i take interest in the history of congo it has been our only colony for many years rwanda was a belgian protectorate but not a colony and it is part of our countrys history nowadays it seems to be very popular to say that all that the belgians did to congo was wrong especially in the 19th century im not saying that bad things didnt happen of course they did but back then this wasnt abnormal do you really think the french or the brits were that much nicer in their colonies no they werent it was normal at the time for our king leopold ii to use congo as a way to gain personal wealth it was his private property it didnt belong to the state then and he tried to make the most out of it of course gruesome things like hands being chopped off happened and yes to todays standards thats inadmissible but in those days it was common practice and it has to be said all this didnt happen anymore during the last decades i know several people who have lived an worked in congo for many years before the declaration of congolese independence its true that they had several black servants but they are very nice people and i really cant imagine they ever treated them bad for as far as i know they have always treated them with a lot of respect however im not saying all belgians did in fact if they werent that old now almost all about 80 years old now they would love to return to congo  the good thing about this movie is that it gives an historically accurate vision on what happened during the last years of belgian governance and the first years of congolese independence the story isnt as black and white perhaps not the best words in this context but how else to explain what i mean as i feared it would be it doesnt say that all the belgians did was wrong and all the congolese did was good it shows perfectly how the congolese in their rush of getting independent from the belgians didnt mind to accept help from the russians as well as the americans who both had more eye for the raw materials like copper diamonds bauxite rubber and getting the congolese in their political camp and werent all that interested in their independence it does not only give a good idea of how lumumba became more powerful but also how mobutu played a double role it shows the belgian reaction on some of our compatriots being violated threatened and even murdered my father was one of the paratroopers who were send to congo to rescue the belgians it gives a good idea of the political problems lumumba encountered as the province katanga didnt want to be part of the congolese republic the role that the belgians had in the murder on lumumba  it all gets its part in this movie  the story seems to be very accurate and the characters really look and act like the real ones this movie has been able to give a very good idea of what life in congo in the late fifties and early sixties was like and should be seen by everybody who is interested in the history of the country but it should also be shown in history classes especially in belgium because its a part of our history that should never be forgotten i give it a 7510 perhaps even an 810,positive,1
i enjoyed this one because i can relate to it   at one time in my life i was trying to make films and experienced many of the same problems mark borchardt did in trying to make his film and i also went through a protracted period of selfabsorbed arrested development where i refused to grow but then miraculously i got married and had kids i realized that being a struggling filmmaker was in all likelihood not going to feed my family so i got a decent job and did what i felt i needed to do to make that happen that is what an mature responsible adult does   mark hasnt faced up to that reality as yet and so in that sense he is a retarded adolescent for this reason there is a hopelessness about him like don quixote he seems so inept and selfdeluded that he doesnt realize how bad off he really is the viewer feels a sense of superiority and pity for him and his circle mark has kids and an exwife and bills to pay but the film depicts him caring basically only about pursuing his artistic vision   despite this mark comes across in the film as a likeable individual surrounded by a very interesting family and group of friends unfortunately mark lacks many of the things necessary to be successful both in life and in a career maturity responsibility education knowledge life experience prioritization financial clout etc yet he trudges on much like ed wood apparently without any semblance of a clue   i guess we are supposed to feel encouraged by the spectacle of the never say die attitude of this noble individual struggling against the odds and man what odds there are kiefer sutherland colin hanks tori spelling and angelina jolie are all offspring of bigtime film or tv people no doubt they will all want to direct some day if they arent already how much room is there for an independent like mark its like watching a guy hit himself in the head with a board over and over again come to think of it that is pretty close to what happens to one of marks actors with the kitchen cabinet door in one of the funniest scenes i have ever seen in any movie  despite these misgivings and seeming criticisms i truly enjoyed this movie and would heartily recommend it to anyone uncle bill is amazing i have a friend who met both mike and mark and he told me that in real life these guys are just exactly the way they appeared in the movie,positive,1
paula i may be a bitch but ill never be a butch   a hilarious line in an otherwise rather tiresome skin flick which features a pretty honey in stacey walker but thats about all this gals a real tease who lures her boyfriends coworkers and even her lesbian roommate paula into her bedroom but then turns into a whack job who cries rape and calls for the police   the schizophrenic personality of this certified ct is interesting for maybe a little while but this story ultimately turns into a real repetitive onenote affair at least the ending is worth the wait for those who will still care by that time,negative,0
its always a pleasure to see characters in a movie who are wholly goodhearted and wellintentioned even when theyre surrounded by those who are neither the films moderately silly premise is that the conservative religious franklin family mother father teen boy and girl are involved in an accident wherein the parents and brother have a neardeath experience during which they meet jesus a pleasant but somewhat exasperated soul who removes from them the burden of original sin when they return to their lives many of their views and attitudes have changed much to the consternation of the daughter who didnt share the experience the religious side is i think presented with a good balance from the good jesus to the starkly awful those of his followers who are obsessed with the sins of others and utterly oblivious to their own its a movie to make you think give you a few good laughs along the way and leave you with the pleasant feeling that the world just might be a nicer place than you think it is,positive,1
this movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel  quirky and obnoxious characters a few quirky town with quirky folk a quirky coffee shop or restaurant coffee shop here lots of shots of canadian stuff for postcards ocean stuff here lots of mention of gotta get out of this town downright booooring  and it succeeds on all counts  something to note though i couldnt figure out whether this movie was just trying to be postnorthern exposure quirky comedy or something surreal like a druginduced or psychotic hallucination the editing of this movie jumped around nonsensically from one unrelated thing to another with zero pacing or motivation not to mention the fact that half the time we didnt even know where we were jumping take for instance the very opening shots of yelling teens in a car who are they and what the h did they have to do with anything and this sub  uh  plot use that word plot loosely concering kids that seem to span generations i dont think they actually do but the editing makes it look like they materialize from flashback all of a sudden to current time huh what did i miss  avoid unless for laughs or you want to try and trip out on the inept editing,negative,0
i think it is saying something that the bollywood bride and prejudice stayed more faithful to the source material than this 2005 hollywood version did i also laughed more at the bollywood version mr kholi priceless if you have read the book or seen the 1995 bbc version and liked them you will be in for a nasty surprise going in to this film then my friend however who had seen neither was mildly amused by the film if you are a jane austen purist though or even a filmgoer who dislikes historical inaccuracies it will be painful to sit through this  ugh the script the script was the biggest problem i imagine the actors wouldnt have fared half so badly if theyd had a decent script perhaps penned by somebody who actually loved austens work  what travesties were committed well youll be forced to endure such incredulous lines as dont you dare judge me lizzy and leave me alone for once in your lives not only are such lines far from anything that could come from jane austens eloquent pen but can anyone honestly believe words like that spilling from the mouth of a genteel young lady from the regency era the usage of modern colloquialisms is one of the many irritating ways that the screenwriter butchers the book the writer also decided to give characters lines that in the book were said by a completely different characters and all for no apparent purpose worse of all when they do try to stick a bit closer to the books writing the screenwriter has a nasty and unnecessary habit of rearranging austens phrases and substituting awkward synonyms for her already perfect words it was as if the screenwriter sat down with the book in one hand and a thesaurus in the other when writing the script stick to austens words she did it better than you i assume all of this was done in a revisionist spirit and in an effort to distance this film from the iconic 1995 bbc version however for me it also made a travesty of the true spirit of austens most beloved work  the casting did have potential though it was quickly dashed away once the script kicked in but keira giggling excessively and baring your crooked teeth does not equal charm and vivacity and i think mr mcfayden though i find him tolerably handsome enough misread his script and was under the impression he was playing heathcliff and not the formidable mr darcy i really did enjoy brenda blethyn kelly reilly and the actor who played mr collins their interpretations were really rather refreshing  oh but donald sutherland somebody described his performance as seeming like a hobo who had accidentally wandered onto the movie set and i must say it is an apt description and can somebody tell me why they fashioned wickham after legolas though he was in the movie for under two minutes i daresay and without his impressive archery skills to perk up the movie  on a wardrobe note i would kill for miss bingleys dresses because they were sumptuous and would fit in more with the modern century a sleeveless regency evening gown please more versace than austen that is sure and poor keira all of the budget went to her salary and not her wardrobe oh and im sure they eventually caught the bastard who stole the one hairbrush from the movie set unfortunately they didnt catch him soon enough to comb the actresses tresses before filming rolled  in short with this new hollywood version bid adieu to austens eloquence subtlety and wit because youll be getting the complete opposite,negative,0

i dont think ive ever been so bowled over by the sheer absurdity of a movie in my entire life as i was when i walked out of this piece of crap nothing in it makes any sense none of it is clever or well thought out out of lack of truly suspenseful moments they repeatedly use that total copout trick where you build up the music before the character does something like open a door or push aside a curtain and then nothings there thats ok to do once maybe but i counted three times there are things thrown in for no apparent reason characters halfformed story lines the characters werent well developed at all the ending was bad bad bad bad everything every component of this film is terrible and im just here to warn you all of that,negative,0
this movie was extremely disappointing i thought it would be another marijuana comedy but dont be mislead its not at all there are barely any weedrelated jokes that come to mind i dont even think they smoke any weed in this movie the marijuana field is merely a plot device  my impression after seeing this film was that four friends were bored one summer and decided to write up a script full of their idea of witty dialog and make a movie the product is bland dialog supported by mediocre acting to say this movie has no hook is a huge understatement dont waste your time or money,negative,0
mobile suit gundam wing is the fourth series in the continuing gundam chronicles unlike the previous entries which focused on massive wars this one is a little different instead of having an armyvsarmy situation this one is led by five teenage boys due to their ability to blend in more readily than normal adults and their machines called gundams because of the metal alloy used in their construction which leads to problems since gundams are supposed to be destroyed replaced by mobile suits which are piloted lessdestructive weapon platforms and dolls which are ran on ai and are used as grunt infantry  the whole point of the series is a metaphysical question that gives gundam wing an edge over a greater portion of the anime that makes its way here especially since most anime is adapted from popular magazines such as naruto dragonball one piece dragonball z and inuyasha which are all from shonen jump which is now available in america  mobile suit gundam wing sets itself apart from most anime in the fact that instead of overthetop battles between mortals who more resemble gods gundam is very humanistic and seems to revel in the fact that it is dramatic instead of melodramatic and events seem to unfold across the series gracefully normally in anime there are more than few series that think that the best way to go about having a small battle is to have it take a halfhour  something that would never happen in real life gundam tops this by making sure that everyone knows that characters will die machines will be destroyed and rebuilt battles will be lost and won and it never seems as though it makes the actions themselves satirical  but the magic of gundam wing is in the details and what this series has that more anime would be grateful for having emotion instead of mythic prophecies magic or overblown martial arts gundam wing is hardline science fiction from a country that hates hardline science fiction note the author would like to state that neon genesis evangelion is not hardlineplausibleinreallife science fiction due to the religious subject matter that is the core of its series they love star wars but hate ai the movie henceforth why gundam wing was and gundam seed is now in production for both japanese and us releases at the same time with two voice teams american audiences only have to wait two or three weeks after the end of the japanese season to catch the dubbed or subtitled versions or even the edited seed episodes that air on cartoon network  the emotion is that these two sides that are fighting a war are technically backwards the heroes are those who defend the rights of the more wealthy and aristocratic citizens of earth from the band of terrorists bent on victory at any and all costs that make up the protagonists of mobile suit gundam wing this is not war this is total war every person every building every street is a target for attack both on earth and off  my only complaint and the reason it didnt get the score of ten is that at about threefourths of the way through it just kind of goes dead for a few episodes and no one really seems to change kind of like a presenttime flashback which is fine due to what it reveals about the characters but at the same time it drags down what should be the brewing between project meteor and oz but the final two episodes and the overplayedoncartoonnetwork back in 20012003 mobile suit gundam wing endless waltz movie more than make up for the slack,positive,1
we toss around the term superstar way too lightly these days but heres one guy that truly deserves it  i was glued to the set this entire show the song selection was perfect  it only contained the songs i actually wanted to hear and cut in with documentary footage during the weaker new songs i loved that the band was just a five guys on stage in a very minimalist environment with songs of this strength you dont need a circus to be entertained  the shots of the crowd were amazing too how many performers can affect the original beatles fans now in their 50s and beyond get young kids to jump up at the opening lines of cant buy me love and impact everyone in between   while watching i also realized that in the wake of john lennons tragic death paul mccartney instantly became an afterthought paul not only lost john and george no matter what their final relations were it must be hard to lose someone with whom you changed the world but he also lost his wife linda and never really seemed to garner the acknowledgment lennons murder received i agree that lennons murder was horrible but only now did i realize that paul was sort of forgotten in the aftermath i was very happy that hes found love again in heather  as for those complaining about the audiovideo quality i had no complaints whatsoever both were crystal clear on my set i think these same people will complain about the quality of dvd when the next format comes out theyll never be satisfied  my only regret was not buying a ticket to this show when i had the chance thanks to this video i was able to enjoy it  when people remember john lennon they will first remember his murder and then his music i now have a new appreciation for paul mccartney because if nothing else he will be remembered for his music first and lets hope another lunatic wont change this because the mccartney catalog is pretty good,positive,1
violence whether real or not always has an impact in this film the violence is about as crass as you could ask for in the great ecstacy the director has successfully demonstrated what extremes of violence people are capable of but what was the point the violence looks like a mix of noës irreversible and  kubricks clockwork orangeboth of which are remarkable films dont get me wrong im not opposed to screen violence at all and ive seen some nasty stuff in my filmgoing years but this film as a whole is totally juvenile the story is never developed enough to offer any reason for the extreme violence the rizla paper thin reason we are give for roberts demise is his introduction to drugs danny dyer plays the character who is partly responsible for roberts drug fuelled demise however he is on screen for less than 5 minutes lesley manville is roberts unable to cope mum i am not sure what either of these actors is doing in a film of this low caliber the acting is wooden the scene in the kitchen with the tvcook and his wife for instance is as painful to watch if not more so than the shocking finale who wrote those dialogues some of the comments the boys makelooks like shes enjoying it are so trite as to tempt one to laugh if it were not for clays ardent desire to bombard us with harrowing images of mutilated female genitals why we need to be shown such detail possibly down to the directors adolescent obsession with sadistic pornographic imageryone can only wonder at this young mans psychology  the political meaning of the film was repeatedly brought to our attention due to the amount of scenes in the bar outside the tvcooks house war in iraq reports was perhaps too obvious in my opinion yes war is violent social determinism causes frustration were all prone to horrifingly violent acts whether youre in politics or on the street popping e juxtaposing all these things as part of the same underlying issue is evading the actual issue which is the meaning of violence in man this issue is one that we still havent managed to grasp and certainly not in this film  my opinion derivative badlymade and pointless,negative,0
the only problem with married to the mob is that it is not funny it dresses up exactly like a romantic comedy but almost nothing that happens is funny but if you can look at it as a film where almost nothing funny happens then youll have a really good time its a glitzy mob film too as per the title extremely glitzy but the director jonathan demme is one of the few prevailing cult directors who fully and completely embraced the 1980s in his work from that decade rather than understandably pretending it was still the 1970s  the opening credits combine 1980s animation italianamericanism and miseenscene lathered on top of each other at once from there despite 1980sness it feels about right the lighting by demmes frequent cinematographer tak fujimoto and jukebox soundtrack rife with widely varying pop and alternative jams are gaudy and that is indeed controlled and nuanced as part of the atmosphere demme is good at colorful instant characterizations in his visual and sometimes seemingly impetuous composition of a fun mix of styles a plot that couldve gone any which way where a smooth fbi agent played by a very bland matthew modine trying to infiltrate a mafia family sees a chance when a gun moll played with comehither allure by michelle pfeiffer tries to leave the criminal lifestyle after her triggerman husband in just what you would hope for in an alec baldwin performance is wacked  the way it goes works for awhile because demme seems to have a firm hand on the wheel he knows the significance of showing us the very subjective and relatable lifeathome scenes with pfeiffer as well as her cares and longings as a morally conflicted mom although her relationship with son joey is taken a bit for granted what mobsters son is listening to partypooper mom when dads boss played with dean stockwells trademark naturalness and by far the scenestealing standout of the cast is giving him such awesome gifts on the whole though demmes latheredon stylizations are easily viewed as a novel take on a fun crime thriller tale  ultimately though we find weve been going the wrong way because inevitably modine and pfeiffer have to fall in love thats not inherently bad and every here and there it actually feels bearable but as a romantic subplot it is not handled interestingly or well hardly at all because it hopscotches across various sundry clichés which fulfill the initial expectation of a cheesy 1980s date flick and for that audience i think it has just the right impact but for someone who has found themselves genuinely interested in the story and the aesthetic approach it is a letdown into state of tedium  so its a decent movie with huge missteps at certain points but as a date movie or a nostalgic piece for those who grew up in the 80s perhaps saw a lot of date movies in the 80s the entertainment value is not as likely to fluctuate except for said deficit in true laughs there maybe a few scoffs and its very broadly tongueincheek but i wouldnt leave the comedy aisle with the high hopes with which id have initially entered whatever the case anyway there are additional joys in bit roles by great character actors who have by now begun to fade like nancy travis joan cusack and oliver platt,positive,1
once again almenábar has provided us with a top quality film this director is amazing and hes proven that hes equally talented and effective when crossing genres   the excellent character development of the movie through dialogue and personality quirks but with more subtle details as well ramons fathers gaze allows the audience to identify with the protagonists very closely making the importance and emotional impact of the events which take place all the more profound the visuals are at times simple at times stunning the dream to the beach and i think almenábars films really benefit from the fact that he also composes the music  it matched the films varying moods flawlessly  more than just a film about euthanasia which in itself is an important issue this film tackles the duality of a man who at times genuinely seems to enjoy life albeit in a quite limited way and yet one who is unswerving in his desire to die the overwhelming sadness of the film is punctuated by welltimed quips of humor which seem all the funnier because they provide a welcome respite from the melancholy you will certainly feel  although clearly in favor of euthanasia this film does an excellent job representing the myriad points of view of ramons friends and family most poignant was ramons father when he said despondent theres only one thing worse than losing a child that the child wants to die  excellent writing acting directing cinematography music  1010,positive,1
if you find the hopelessly amateurish acting the uninteresting story the fake blood and all the mindless shooting bearable then you may actually have a fairly good time watching this trashy lowrent exploitation film you might also want to check out a pretty good catfighting sequence thats offered although its not good enough to make the rest of the movie worth sitting through ,negative,0
i understand the draw and appeal to such a different type of movie and i am a huge admirer of movies with little dialog but all the same this one absolutely terrible ive been to the scottish highlands and found the lack of scottish accents in the characters disappointing this plot was strong enough in theory but the cheap sets and lack of a single realistic character kept this film from getting off the ground i feel the use of silence to create atmosphere only works when you have actors who can exude some sort of presence without speaking and these actors certainly cant if you want a silent movie that captures that presence try le dernier combat there have been very few movies that i couldnt even manage to finish and this was one of them absolute dribble,negative,0
the story of this film is truly remarkable a virus cut loose and only 1 of the human race survived the only thing we know now is that animals rule the land above and there are posters everywhere that say the twelve monkeys did it thats right the human race had to hide underground from the sickness that had killed over 500 billion people apparently animals do not contract this disease day by day the present scientist try to discover what type of sickness had caused this how it was created if nature did it or a mere human being had created it all they know is that there is are a bunch of animals running around a city above them the deaths began during 19961997 and twelve monkeys have something to do with it or at least thats what the poster says so a current convict named james cole bruce willis is sent as a volunteer to get some samples from above after he does his volunteer work he is asked to be sent back in time to the year 1996 to figure out what happened to the world cole accepts and the story of the twelve monkeys begin  throughout the story the time machine gets the dates wrong quite a few times from 1990 to some time during the 1950s in a middle of a war throughout the time traveling back and forth it starts to mess james up in the head and that twist the story up the whole story is very well done and i would of gave it a higher grade if it wasnt for the ending i personally didnt like the ending of the movie and i was very disappointed i just was expecting a more explaining ending then what had happen but it isnt everyone who thinks this way so i gave it a 8 but if everyone had the same opinion as me i would give it a 6 or 7  for the whole acting of the film i give it a a bruce willis is great for this role and he acts good but brad pitt is completely 100 excellent his acting is so great he gets into the character so well i never really cared for brad pitt in till i saw him in this and fight club there characters or similar in this film he is just a little more insane in this film so overall i think this film is completely worth checking out for most people its a great science fiction film i just dont think it is a masterpiece,positive,1
i must have seen this a dozen times over the years i was about fifteen when i first saw it in b  w on the local pbs station  i bought a dvd set for the children to see and am making them watch it they dont teach history in school and this explains the most critical event of the 20th century it expands their critical thinking  impartially with the participants on all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why it details what lead up to the war and the actual war  buy it for your children along with alistair cookes america watch it with them and make them understand youll be so glad you did,positive,1
this film is not at all as bad as some people on here are saying i think it has got a decent horror plot and the acting seem normal to me people are way overexagerating what was wrong with this it is simply classic horror the type without a plot that we have to think about forever and forever we can just sit back relax and be scared,positive,1
1 bad acting  2 for a bunch of castaways on an alien planet it sure looked like home especially with the houses and roads you can glimpse in the background  3 terrible plot with stupid caracters making idiotic decisions and blithely losing precious survival equipment and clothing left right and center  4 cool 70s scifi jumpsuits possibly the only good thing about this movie  5 interesting ship at the beginning this crew must have been watching space 1999 a lot too bad it blows up so early the escape ship also got sunk too fast sigh  6 anthropologists might find some aspects of the movie interesting in terms of primate group behavior,negative,0

i saw this movie on the lowlands festival 23 24 25th of august after a friend of mine said this is a very cool movie about the history of skating i didnt now what to expect from this movie was it recorded by a couple of skaters who thought they could do a couple of cool tricks or was it a documentary about skating  so i went in after waiting for about an hour whit out any expectations  this movie is really a nice piece of work about the beginning of skateboarding it started with the zephyr team who where a fine group of surfers this is taking place in a not so nice area to live in at a certain point the waves are not so good any more to surf on so they try something else skateboarding was a fact   if you were a part of the zephyr team in that time you where one of the cool guysgirls because a lot of people saw an escape from the place they were living in with the zephyr team so they were trying all there new tricks now on a skateboard   in no time skateboarding was popular again there were a couple of competitions and one national competition the zephyr team was taking part on several competition and also the national one but what they were doing on there skateboards was unbelievable but the jury didnt now how to judge them so they put the whole skateboarding world on its head  anyway i can tell you the rest of the filmdocumentary but you must see this one with youre own eyes because then you can feel the vibe of this movie this movie got a lot of style for me so i rewarded it with a 8  greetings from gijs and the rest of holland see you,positive,1
i think the consensus is pretty unanimous about this recent tv miniseries its okay but its a far cry from lonesome dove it gets compared to the latter simply because this a prequel to that famous story   commanche moon is definitely worth a watch for any fan of westerns just dont expect it to be as intense as lonesome dove steve zahn and karl urban are not robert duvall and tommy lee jones and the characters they play arent as strong as how duvall and jones portrayed the same two guys some say its unfair to criticize this movie because of the comparison but you have to compare it  its the story of the same two leading texas ranger characters woodrow call and gus mccrae  the main difference i found was that this prequel is a lot of slower and more relational the two rangers and their women at times yet i didnt mind that because the two main women were pretty ladies and generally likable and agreeable people they were played nicely by linda cardelini clara forsythe and elizabeth banks maggie they helped make this long movie palatable if youve seen pictures of women in the old west none of them looked half as pretty as cardelini and banks though they were a joy for these male eyes to ogle maggies son newt was a wonderful kid too  the kind of boy every parent would want  the most interesting character i thought turned out to be inish scull played by val kilmer as in the western film tombstone kilmer almost steals the show from the leads scull is really an original if i ever saw one a strange dude indeed   actually all of the supporting actors in here did a fine job from keith robinsons deets to wes studi as buffalo hump i always find studi to be fascinating no matter what role he plays i wish he had had a bigger role in this miniseries  one thing this film has in common with lonesome dove and other good westerns the scenery and photography its just beautiful at times and is a joy to watch we also have an excellent director of this film simon wincer who directed lonesome dove and an another outstanding tv western crossfire trail he also did two of my other favorite feature films both based in his home country of australia phar lap and quigley down under  unfortunately although i enjoyed this commanche moon is nothing as good as the abovementioned filmsyet i still watched all of it and was sorry it ended if that makes any sense it made me want to watch woodrow and gus again this time with tommy lee and robert  note the title page says this is 360 minutes that must have included the tv commercials the twodisc dvd version i saw was about 4 hours and 40 minutes,positive,1
well i only caught the tail end of this film on hbo just the final 10 minutes or so but i must say that it contains probably the most laughable depiction of distance running ever put on film im a serious distance runner and a dedicated fan of the sport and ive sat through many painful demonstrations in movies before however nothing could have ever prepared me for what is shown on screen in the final 10 minutes of this movie it literally defies belief the depiction of the runners is even more ironic considering that african runners completely dominate the sport and they are elegant and graceful the female protagonist shuffles along like an overweight pregnant woman and her highly trained male supporters are no better well into the race this alleged world class runner is surrounded by pudgy overweight people many of whom are walking i find it interesting that the director decided to have her lead the female competition yet near the end she is shown passing people who look like theyre staggering along on two broken legs are we to believe that this amazing stellar athlete has only overtaken a crippled person at the very end of the race maybe the director just thinks that female runners cant run faster than 12 minute miles and he has obviously never heard of athletes like paula radcliffe or tirunesh dibaba  even if you arent a running fan youll be astonished by the insanely inaccurate portrayal of running and this movie is only watchable as unintentional comedy here is a note to the director the next time you decide to make a movie about a sport it might be worth it to hire at least one person who actually has observed that sport in action,negative,0
  there is something about seeing a movie in a good oldfashioned movie house that adds enormous appeal to every picture i fortunately enough was able to see at film forum in new york city a pair of ernst lubitsch comedies during their three week tribute to the legendary director the double feature i attended was a screening of lubitschs 1938 comedy bluebeards eighth wife and the precode classic design for living neither of which i had seen before everything i read of design for living praised the film but i could not find a good review anywhere for bluebeards eighth wife leonard maltin disliked itvideohound too gave the comedy a low ratingits imdb score was not complimentaryand pauline kael not a great surprise blasted the film in her scathing review so when i went into the city that day i was expecting to enjoy bluebeards eighth wife only slightly and love design for living completely bluebeards eighth wife which was showing first began as the eccentrics who populate the cinema took their seats and the thirties music subsided adolph zukor presents claudette colbert and gary cooper in ernst lubitschs bluebeards eighth wife the title card read then the picture opened with a hilarious scene cooper wants to buy a pair of pajama tops but he doesnt want any part of the bottoms he gets into a squabble with the clerk who seeks the help of his higher bosses and their seems to be no end to the argument enter claudette colbert one of thirties cinemas most beautiful charming and talented personalities ill take the bottom she kindly intercedes and there you have perhaps screwball comedies finest meet cute ever the film kept my interest wonderfullyi found myself laughing almost constantly when colbert discovers just before a family portrait is taken that her groomtobe has been married seven times the entire theatre broke into histerics when she bargains for money immediately after she gets over her shock the laughs which still havent ceased intensify and edward everett horton milked some hilarious reactions out of the script as well when cooper takes inspiration from shakespeares the taming of the shrew in disciplining his wife by slapping her in the face i could not control my laughter when she slapped him back and the drunk scene with the scallions is one of claudette colberts funniest comic scenes the greatest comic moment of the film came when colbert highers a boxer to teach her husband a lesson in pure screwball fashion he knocks out the wrong man instead putting her friend david niven into a cold sleep he awakes as cooper is arriving in order to cover up the situation colbert herself in a moment of strong sexiness puts her fist up to niven asks where did that man hit you here right here right here and then bam knocks him out again the film was wonderful from beginning to end it was a perfect delight i loved design for living too though i dare say i think for sheer laughs and entertainment bluebeards eighth wife was the better and more enjoyable film there is some charm of seeing a vintage film on the large screen and in the presence of others laughing one feels more comfortable doing so himself that is perhaps why i felt the way i did about bluebeards eighth wife,positive,1
i just finished watching this on tv and what can i say but this is the worst film i have ever seen im embarrassed to be from melbourne where the film was made diabolical acting amateurish makeup effects and a really bad soundtrack as for the plot well thats even more stupid some of the scenes just left me stunned as to how bad it was theres a reason they put these types of films on late night tv  because theyre utter rubbish avoid at all costs,negative,0
first things first  though i believe joel schumacher is at best a mediocre director and more often as here downright bad the lions share of the blame for this ugly travesty of a film must go to john grisham whose novel this is based on  set at an undetermined point in time the 50s the 70s now the film opens with the rape and murder of a child by rednecks so caricatured that their purpose seems to be to reassure racists that at least were not that bad cut to the bad guys arriving at the courthouse when the girls father samuel l jackson fearful they will get off on some technicality guns them down in cold blood before the trial   the setting is a deep south that probably never existed  the few black characters live in shacks and seem to pick cotton the dyedinthewool racists kiefer sutherland is a cartoon version of a klansman are laughable in their villainy the setpiece is the trial for the defence are the good guys  a milquetoast lawyer played by matthew mcconaughey as though in a coma his assistant played by sandra bullocks breasts she doesnt seem to serve any other narrative purpose and donald sutherland as the requisite drunklawyerwhosobersuptofightthegoodfight for the prosecution kevin spacey goes through the motions of being demon spawn while in the town at large crosses are burned witness are intimidated and the local citizens dont seem to care   some of the reviews here claim the film immoral since surely samuel jackson is a killer and should trust to the forces of the law rather than get off on a feeble hearttugging piece of oratory by matthew mcconaughey to be honest objectionable though the underlying message vigilante justice is good might be everything about the movie stinks the characterizations are pitiful the acting leaden the direction plodding the screenplay and the dialogue almost verging on parody peter menzies lush 50s technicolor cinematography is pretty but derivative   and it goes on for nearly two and a half hours   whats left to say this is a waste of 141 minutes of anyones life it is tedious vacuous and hammy and almost as an afterthought it is morally repugnant,negative,0
jerome crabbe has the lead role in this movie i saw this movie 6 times and i still am not tired of it this movie is similar to flesh  blood in some ways gerald soetman is a great writer he wrote all of paul verhoevens dutch films paul verhoeven is one of the greatest directors i have seen all of his movies all except for showgirls my mom does not like him so much but i disagree i think all of his films are a ride to watch especially total recall and basic instinct jerry goldsmith did some of his movies which include total recall basic instinct and hollow man i wish jerry goldsmith never died dutch films are different but still enjoyable,positive,1

john hughes son wrote a high school drama wow i thought as i checked the flicks info here on imdb late on a saturday night having found myself watching the opening credits on bbc2  ive just finished watching it and sadly it was downhill from there on arguably you cant spoil a film this poor but ill leave the spoilers out of this review   theres an awful lot of style over very little substance unfortunately the style hasnt dated too well in the eight years since its release as for the substance the film tries to pose an interesting look at the nature of control in society through the microcosm of schoollife but beneath the shiny veneer a remotely meaningful or relevant argument fails to materialise characters are painted in childishly broad strokes falling into the kind of generic stereotypes the writers father sought to question in breakfast club   director kyle cooper does a decent job keeping the pace up perhaps relying a little too much on montages of information which soon becomes a tiresome device but at least pushes the story along but his efforts dont sufficiently detract from the poor script and bizarre casting how anyone is supposed to side with maddox when blake shields gurns and glowers his way through the part i just cant understand not to mention the numerous gaping plot holes im all for creative license but when the bad guys know the identities of the good guys making their lives a misery but fail to act in any way to stop them you really have to wonder why this script didnt undergo another few redrafts before production  did daddy even read it  im sure a younger audience might get some enjoyment from this film and all power to them but theyre really better off sticking with hughes srs high school output and if the idea of schooltime rebellion is what really appeals the 1968 classic if is a much more satisfying examination of the subject,negative,0
prom night is about a girl named donna brittany snow who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night and by doing so killing her family friends and her enemies   now before i begin let me say have you been tired of pg13 horror movies that havent been scary lately are you tired of stupid girl dialog oh my god and talking about girlish things and are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying and the last thing are you tired of the us remaking asian japanese and chinese films that pretty much sums up prom night but im still not done with the review  the only reason to see prom night is to crack a laugh at the kills if not dont see prom night you never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall and by the way the deaths are repeating like 247 so not only arent they scary but its obnoxious by the time i met the cast i think i was ready to hurl too much girl talk too much guy talk and lots of oh my gosh its our prom i understand its fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate   if i were to put prom night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films id be the first one too im not going to be surprised if it gets released on dvd for cheap and quick seriously dont spend your money or the time for dull acting cheap scares and a night to die for when watching the film  1 star out of 10 ps if i could give the film zero stars i would,negative,0
its not too bad a b movie with sanders barrie hale cowen hamilton gargan fitzgerald and even willie best we could be either with charlie chan moto the falcon blackie holmes or the saint etc in other words you get the chance to spend another hour in the company of some old friends from plain to urbane murdering and being murdered  always a pleasure in my book  barries a hardboiled dame out to avenge and clear her framed and dead father a police detective by planning and carrying out with her coterie a string of underworld assassinations which would surely have had the opposite effect sanders joins in the fun simply by dancing in the right club in the right place in the right city at the right time with the right lighting falling on both him and the first killer at the right time and killing him  the story and actings ok the only gripe ive got is near the end with the hurried and almost laughable discovery of who the evil genius waldeman was  did they almost forget about his relevance in the plot that said a solid entry in the series,positive,1
well now this strange movie it was listed as a comedy but i certainly found nothing to laugh at actually i am struggling to find anything positive to say about this film oh here i go alex ferns is not bad in the lead role and i did not pick the ending for a change but apart from that this has no great direction solidly two dimensional characters and is not funny enough to be a comedy or serious or dark enough to be any form of decent drama i would really avoid ever having to watch this movie again and think it does nothing to benefit any of the working class characters it is attempting to portray i found it hard to empathise for any of the characters and was not given enough information on the lead character jimmy to believe his motives best avoided,negative,0
movie industry is tricky business  because decisions have to be made and everyone involved has a private life too thats the very original thesis of this feeble attempt at making an insightful film about film and indeed no better proof of the industrys trickiness than seeing anouk aimée and maximilian schell trapped in this inanity the insight consists of talking heads rattle off bullshit like should i make a studio movie that pays a lot or should i make an indie item and stay true to my artistic self do the latter please or our relationship is not only professional its private as well its a rather complex situation to handle isnt it yes it is my dear between the insipid dialogs one gets glimpses of palm trees hotel lobbies and american movie posters no sign of nonamerican film presence on the croisette recurrent slumber sessions are inevitable making the 100 minutes of the film feel like ages jenny gabrielle is spectacularly unconvincing in justifying her own presence in the frame,negative,0
needed an excuse to get out of the house while paint dried  left the movie after an hour to return and watch the paint dry  i dont recall ever walking out on a movie before but i really tried to stay the script was not up to the cast and just kept going and going badly  come on uma thurman doing this stuff fairly lame special effects these were older characters and actors doing superficial horny 20something lives  just sort of annoying and wrong feeling  this review is base only on the first hour  it might have gotten better i just had to get home and see if the paint dried a darker shade than when it went on,negative,0
by todays standards the di might seem a little hokey lee emerys version is more accurate i graduated boot camp in parris island sc in 1964 jim moore is as close to the real thing as you could put on the screen in 1957 i cant comment on the plot but i thought the ending was unrealistic for mcrd pvt owens is like many who found himself in a lot more difficult situation than he bargained for like so many he joined the marine corps for all the wrong reasons my drill intructors were more like gysgt hartman than tsgt jim moore a lot more the di is more korean era and full metal jacket is more viet nam era todays movies allow that sort of thing on the screen i have the di in my collection i only recently found it on dvd,positive,1
not even lesser hitch but simply a bad movie the cinematic equivalent of a dirtyoldman ugly in every way unimaginative script static point of view putrid clothing ghastly hair unlikable actors and one truly gratuitous rapeandstrangulation scene the directors perverse sense of humor is present but it is not applied consistently the movie comes alive only in its cruelty the women fare especially badly frenzy could be used as proof the director was a misogynist though a better explanation to me is that perhaps beginning with his tv series and psycho which he himself described as an exercise in thrift an experiment to see if a television crew could shoot a passable feature alfred hitchcock had pretty much abandoned art and settled for commerce in frenzy the great master seems to be bowing to convention trying to go with the times and give audiences what he thinks they want in the form of unappealing nudity nudgenudge winks and general nastiness i dont begrudge an old man his rest but i dont want to remember him tired and lazy and pandering time to watch vertigo again,negative,0
this movie was the most out of line and liberally fed movie i have ever seen in my life besides farenheit 911 all of the information was only supported on the opinion of five scientists while 80 of the asssociated press highly criticize the science promoted be gore global warming is a mass media hysteria and nothing more most of the information in the movie was either misquoted or it was wrong all together this movie has been investigated over and over again and has been shown evidence against that prove its lies were nothing but lies  liberal blindness an to think that they show this in school proves that the media has brainwashed us into believing this garbage,negative,0
this film has a really weird mixture of genres  toilet humour and action in one it doesnt really pull it off  it should have stuck to one genre the best thing i can say about the movie is that the dog in it is cute  the most disturbing sequence is in the middle of the film when moses sandler and carter wayans decide to stop off at a hunting lodgemotel im not quite sure what the point of this sequence is  it just seems gratuitous in the extreme the proprietor of the hunting lodge charlie is a very nerdy looking guy for some reason moses starts a conversation with charlie about porno jacking off homosexual sex sex in a threesome charlies photo of his wife appears to be charlie dressed in drag there is no reason for this really juvenile dialogue and scene anyway the whole scene seems to be directed to the moment when a naked moses ends up with carters gun up his butt and charlie sees them through the window it all reeks of school boy humour about homosexuality  horrified and titillated all at the same time  which i dont find funny at all  i have a friend who is always raving about adam sandler movies this is the first one ive seen  after this im not sure i want to see any more  btw this is my husbands account  hes seen happy gilmore and he tells me its quite good  maybe i should give sandler just one more chance  countess skogg,negative,0

i saw this movie last weekend and it is silly and mindless an ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas the victims are scared senseless and can not run from a slow moving old man they drop their torches and shiver instead of attempting to ward him off orduh burn him quentin alias mr fabersham of the honeymooners is married to diane brewster alias miss canfield of leave it to beaver fame who is unhappy in marriage wow love plot the rest of the cast just follows each other in the tombs and wait for screams to react and run to their aid the egyptian girl is not bad looking but does not lend much to the film where is the mummy really just a curse unleashed this does not hold a torch to universal mummy films in the leastwatch this movie if you need sleep because you will dose off,negative,0
it was in 1988 when i saw the ronnie and nancy show for the first time on austrian television at that time i was already a very big fan of spitting image since when it won the bronze rose of the montreux film festival in 1986 of course i recorded every show on tape and watched it again and again  especially the ronnie and nancy show i remember that scene when ronnie stood in front of a painting of abraham lincoln thinking it was a mirror and said to himself i need a shave or most amusing of all when he played ball with his dog  but viceversa  its such a shame that spitting image seems to fall into oblivion it was one of the most fantastic and most intelligent made tvshows ever compared to other satirical broadcasts it was definitely the best of all   well almost 20 years have passed since then and i wish i could see the show again is it possible to purchase it from someone somewhere,positive,1
the phenix city story is a brutal hardhitting docudrama about what was once dubbed the wickedest town in america the film documents the events that led up to the murder by the phenix city crime syndicate of albert patterson an alabama attorney who made a bid for the state attorney generals office as a way to clean up the vice and corruption plaguing his hometown his son john patterson picked up his fathers mantle after his death and won the post making clean up of phenix city a primary item on his agenda  director phil karlson created a film that has the ability to shock even today the grimness is so relentless that the film is actually difficult to watch we see the crime syndicate beat and kill in order to get what they want  the beatings and killings include women and children and one scene in particular revolving around the death of a little black girl is especially disturbing its not exactly an enjoyable film because theres very little payoff at the end to reward the viewer for sitting through the infuriating events leading up to it but its a well made film full of an intense and angry energy  a 15minute prologue includes a series of interviews with the actual inhabitants of phenix city some of who are then portrayed by actors in the fictional portion of the film it lends the film a quality of urgency that carries over into the narrative so that we feel like were watching a documentary the entire time a feeling thats helped by karlsons choice to film on actual locations  im glad i saw this movie but its one of those films that fills you with a sense of righteous indignation and then makes you feel helpless because you cant do anything about it  grade a,positive,1
this movie starts out promisingly with an early scene in which frank morgan advises against gary coopers marriage to his daughter anita louise frank morgan playing an unabashed golddigger loudly complains to cooper about his perceived penury at the hands of his family  including his daughter anita louise i am a fan of all 3 actors frank morgan is to my mind a hollywood treasure cooper a legend and louise a very lovely versatile and underappreciated actress seldom seen in the leading role i also have nothing against teresa wright and while not blessed with great range she usually delivers heartwarming performances  from a promising opening the story slides downhill all the way to the end i found nothing humorous about burning down the home of coopers wouldbe inlaws the butler in such a fastidious nonsmoking household would never just blithely walk away allowing cooper to continue smoking or alternatively he would certainly supply him with some means of disposing of his illtimed cigarette moreover nobody with any common sense would permit himself to be left holding a lit cigarette without asking for some means of disposing of it and finally nobody in his right mind crushes out a cigarette in a handkerchief and sticks it in his pocket this whole sequence just made cooper seem foolish and gauche it is a poor contrivance  ill conceived and filmed in a way that induces ridicule not laughter   the forced medical examination of cooper is equally contrived nobody lets himself undergo a complete medical examination without his being advised of its purpose or giving his consent that cooper did so is too removed from reality to be funny  its absurd stealing babies from hospitals is a serious legal offense and that too is nothing to laugh about finally the scenes of coopers overly fastidious neurotic attention to his babys feeding and weight may have struck a nerve with a few people who have experienced anxiety over their own newborn babies but to me they just seem tedious and slow the wardrobe and prop departments went over the top in those scenes while paradoxically the script writer went to sleep  the lines are just not in the script to generate humor they just miss on all cylinders the laughs come not a mileaminute but more like a light yearaminute the only time the movie has any energy or humor is when frank morgan is on camera  the scene that is totally wasted is when both of coopers love interests and their respective fathers are cooped up in the same hotel room together there is probably a rich vein of humor somewhere in that mine but none of it was extracted  in the end one of the two very likable girls is going to get hurt predictably it is the anita louise character who gets jilted on her wouldbewedding night while it is not on camera that is her fate and it is not particularly funny  even as a loose end she hadnt done anything in this film to make me unsympathetic unlike gail patrick say in my favorite wife consequently i was expecting perhaps hoping is a better word in the context of the film for anita louise to enjoy a happy ending too the fact that such a nice character is essentially wiped out at the movies end really undermines the effect of the happy ending for cooper and wright  i kept waiting for something to happen for the witty dialog so characteristic of movies of the era and it never delivered a good performance by frank morgan in a slightly different role is totally wasted here,negative,0
the sunshine boys was the hilarious 1975 screen adaptation of neil simons play about a retired vaudevillian team played by walter matthau and george burns who had a very bitter breakup and have been asked to reunite one more time for a television special or something like that the problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other richard benjamin appears as matthaus nephew a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this reunion a reality this warm and winning comedy is a lovely valentine to a forgotten form of entertainmentvaudeville and it works mainly thanks to one of neil simons better screenplays and outstanding work by matthau burns and benjamin burns won the best supporting actor oscar for this but i think matthau walks away with this film with his flawlessly hilarious performance as willy clark matthau was nominated for best actor but didnt stand a chance against nicholson for one flew over the cuckoos nest however in another year this was an oscarworthy performance matthau commands the screen and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance the scene where he is auditioning for a potato chip commercial and cant get the name of the product right is a classic the sunshine boys is a warm and winning neil simon comedy which shines thanks to unbeatable chemistry between matthau and burns,positive,1
the make orbreak of a love story for me is whether or not i like the characters and also if they click with each other matt is pretty unlikeable aloof braggart seemingly lazy and a misogynist hes been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable he overcompensates by bragging that hel nail amy he acts so cool around amy that he strikes out twice when they do talk he cant show her who he really is she empathizes and then stonewalls him at just the right moments she seems so mature and strong that the traits of hers that come out later didnt seem to fit for me i found her to be incredibly sexy and pretty    girl next door pretty i call it so i was going to like this movie unless it really screwed up  funny things happen with the coach but matts relationship with the other coach was inspiring the football scenes at the end were perplexing matt doesnt carry the ball but seems to be a blocking back folks he isnt the right size hes fifty pounds too light for that position but i thought his acting was skilled i measure that by the way i wanted to wring his neck a couple of times during his scenes with meredith monroe the film was all right meredith m was better than all right,positive,1

redundant everlasting shots useless shots useless scenes are what you will find in this film in other words it seemed technically poor to me the musical bits are amateurishly directed no synchronization in the wouldbe dancing badly postsynchronized bad and obvious improvisation of the actors from time to time etc   the film is long and boring eventually it makes few point and even less sense   there are some good ideas though some of the comic elements are actually efficient especially the opening scene however the film gets worse and worse so that it is completely unbearable and impossible to understand by the end   the trailer i saw was very dynamic that is not true for the film that is to say the discrepancy between the trailer and the actual film is something very close to a rip off,negative,0
one night at mccools  2001  out of four  by blake french  	according to harald zwart the director of one night at mccools this film is a dark comedy about the power of women over men and how a group of people can all perceive different realities its the same story told from three different points of view and each time we tell the story we try to reveal a little bit more about what actually happened which nobody really knows   	one night at mccools marks the feature film directorial debut of zwart an award winning commercial and music video director who began making short films when he was eight years old i always get nervous when a director of commercials and music videos turns to filmmaking we have seen so many examples of how these guys think they are making another advertisement or music video for tv with their productions zwart resists that tendency he captures a specific humorous truth in one night at mccools from an inventive complex screenplay by the late stan seidel even if it is often somewhat perplexing   	one night at mccools features three men who share their separate experiences about a particularly beautiful young woman in some ways this movie is the comedy version of american beauty but in others it is a world apart   	it all started one night at mccools explains each of the three men to their various listeners there is randy matt dillon a tender at the local bar and his cousin a lawyer named carl paul reiser who stays until the place closes detective dehling john goodman arrives when the saloon becomes the crime scene of the dead boyfriend of a female fatal appropriately named jewel liv tyler randy is the first to see her as an individual treats her unkindly he stands up for her and before you can say sexy they are having vigorous sex and she moves in with him at first randy is reluctant the sex and the violence all in one night  its a little much but who could turn a jewel like jewel away  	jewel changes the lives of each of the three men for detective dehling she pulls him out of a hole of grief since his wife died for carl she makes him forget his loving family and nice little suburban household for randy she lights a few fires both positive and negative the later persuading him to contact a bingo playing hit man named burmeister michael douglas to put an end to her deceptive ways    it is interesting how the movie perceives the three different chronicleseven the costuming of jewel is relative to the man telling the story dehling sees jewel as a beautiful mesmerizing gift from god carl sees jewel as two sexy legs and lots of cleavage randy is unsure what to make of her an awakening to his otherwise boring road to nowhere life the most intriguing element of this movie is jewel herself however deliciously played by the always delightful liv tyler armageddon she is not really interested in the men but what they can offer her her motives are all too simple not truthfully diabolical or evil she is simply a young lady who has learned at an early age that she can get what she wants out of life through her beauty   	the film has a lot of fun with its material from the enthusiastically entertaining cast to its violently hilarious showdown one night at mccools takes advantage of most of its humorous ideas what makes the movie even funnier is how the three mens points of view differ the actors have a lot of fun with their characters too goodman is curiously whimsical reiser fits his kinky squirmy part quite well douglas is sly and mysterious in one of the movies funniest performances dillon gives his character arrogant personality even though randy is a lackluster nobody liv tyler is dazzling she injects jewel with the perfect amount of boastful charisma and tantalizing wit she reminds us of mena suvaris intimate performance in american beauty  	one night at mccools is the first film to come from michael douglas new production company furthur films it is a creative genuine and sexy production along the way we often become caught up in the twisty structure but that is a natural response to a movie that intentionally interweaves several angles to a single story the movie ends on a note that is both black and comedic this is another one of those comedies in which serious events take place in a humorous way ie the black comedy many films of this genre come across as either too black or too lackadaisical one night at mccools is one of the few that actually work   ,positive,1
there are so many holes in the plot it makes you wonder if they knew they had an audience for this and just threw it together i dont know much about george zucco but ive seen him in two movies obviously he has been cast as the loving father mad scientist vampire guy he looks so ordinary im surprised that he ended up in the genre this is the typical i will create monsters that can be used to fight as an army by transferring wolf blood or is it coyote to his hired hand he turns him into a werewolf glen strange who was one of karloffs successors as the frankenstein monster plays the kindly lovable hired man who is victimized because he trusts the mad doctor at first the scientist is able to control when petro his name can be transformed but like the invisible man suddenly he starts morphing on his own and becomes a liability there is a little love story of the daughter and a reporter with kind of a high pitched voice golly miss brooks she wants to leave but her father the doctor wont allow that he is also driven by a group of his peers who mocked his research before and now he is going to have satisfaction the way he plot to embarrass or kill them is pretty far fetched and depends a lot on petro and the guys sitting around waiting to be attacked its not a very good movie the strong point is atmosphere of the woods as people and monsters lurk around the spanish moss once again the townsfolk are a bunch of morons who look like they escaped from a bad western one thing that stayed with me was that a little girl is the first victim and that seems unusual for a film of this era theres also a pipe smoking old lady who knows about werewolves but nobody listens to her,negative,0

1 how is it that everyone can understand each other perfectly without devices like universal translators or translator microbes did the creators of this show realize that people who were taken from different parts of the earth in different time frames attilla the hun wasnt a contemporary of preliterate hellenic cultures nor were the vikings contemporary to the pyramid builders speak different languages and can never develop a language so similar to modern day englishexcept for the inflections they do not use which has been influenced by latin ancient greek danish and french   2 cultural differences cant be overcome so easily trust has to be won yet everywhere the team arrives they are welcomed without any suspicion and start ordering people around like they are their appointed leaders of course real fans would comment that they are perceived as gods the people they meet should be shocked by their technology and accuse them of witchcraft and the like  3 historical background none visually it might vaguely remind you of greek or viking culture but anyone can dress in a bunch of tablecloths or run to a local costume rental for a plastic helmet with horns and claim to look the part a smalltown theater group probably has better props  4 boring another lame canuck production which inexplicably ran for ten long years as a kids show it could make the grade but anyone who has a little knowledge about human behavior and language couldnt bear to even watch the first twelve episodes of season 1 like i just did i very much wanted to believe i had found a decent scifi show otherwise i would shut it of and cleansed my computer of this refuge after the first five minutes,negative,0

the minion is about well a minion a servant of satan and whose goal is to get the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped he is some sort of demon who possess human beings and when the body dies will possess another anyone who happens to be possessed will go on some berserker rage dolph lundgren plays lukas a member of a secret order of templars who is tasked to keep the key away from the minion the movie begins a thousand years ago in the middle east where a couple of knight templars flee from the minion then flash forward to 1999 where the key winds up somewhere underground in new york an archeologist is assigned to studydig the place where the key was found needless to say the minion is after the key and the movie becomes a long winded chase scene between the minion and lukas and archeologist  the movie is just that a low budget bmovie flick the movie lacks energy and just trods along youll follow the chase but you wont ever feel involved in the story which willfully takes ideas from previous movies especially the terminator films the fight scenes with the minion is troublesome in that you never get the sense of how good or how bad a warrior this demon is it skillfully becomes a oneman army when fighting a squad of templars but sucks when it comes to oneon one and its supposed to be around for a long time all this goes to show that any sense of logic is just thrown down the drain for convenience the whole idea of a secret order of templars a door to hell and the key isnt well explained we are merely to accept that they just exist the movie seems to have been made with the feeling theres not much potential to the story but only enough to make a few bucks dolph lundgren sure looks like he wish he were somewhere else  the verdict 2 of 5 stars,negative,0
okay heres the deal theres this american pilot whos flying along minding his own business when suddenly hes outnumbered by evil cowardly nonamerican fighter planes theyre middle eastern types but suffice to say they dont like apple pie or elvis presley who proceed to shoot him down now this american pilot was doing nothing wrong but those evil nonamericans didnt care and before you know it hes banged up in a foreign jail and sentenced to death  now what would normally happen here is that the us military would carpet bomb a couple of nearby towns until the pilot was released but not this time those evil peace lovin types probably got involved and managed to stop any kind of retaliatory massacre as you can imagine this doesnt please the pilots family and the evil foreign dictator has this smug contented look about him hell make those americans pay oh yes indeed  but he didnt reckon on doug masters the captured pilots 16yearold son you see doug has been able to fly a plane longer than he can drive a car which cant be that long and decides to fly into that evil foreign country and get his dad back so with the help of his friends doug and his wingman retired pilot chappy sinclair doug launches a two man air raid on the foreigners   now youd think that this plan would be bound to fail but youd be wrong sure those middle eastern types might be all veteran pilots but dougs got an ace up his sleeve he listens to rock music when he flies after shooting down a dozen or so enemy planes and blowing up an oil refinery doug lands at an airport and gets his now wounded dad onboard the plane understandably the evil not quite so smug anymore dictator gets quite annoyed at these antics and takes to the skies himself in bid to shoot down doug but the young lad listens to some more rock music and blows the villain out of the sky hurrah  after doug and chappy have shot down 90 of their air force the foreigners send up their last few planes in a rather poor attempt to shoot doug down but in the nick of time a flight of us f16s turn up and scare them away  i cannot recommend this film enough it was the first ever videocassette movie that i brought and until i was twenty i kept hoping that my dad would get shot down over a foreign country so that i could rescue him but hes doesnt like flying so it didnt happen,positive,1
back in the days before the toxic avenger the lowcamp kings at troma films tried to take the high ok somewhatlesslow road of producing straight slasher pics id like to think that viewing the results here is what convinced them to give up all pretension and go for selfconscious parody  splatter university is another film for the masochists in the audience as it meanders about through two separate casts and innumerable pointless subplots it actually becomes painful to watch lets see if i can summarize  after learning that a dangerous psychopath has escaped from a local hospital the action moves to a catholic university i dont recall the name but in honor of the title lets call it st splatter the students are listless and sullen and argue pettily with each other slackers ahead of their time meanwhile the new professor julie parker proves utterly incompetent at her job the kids deal with relationships infidelity unwanted pregnancies lecherous priests and how to avoid doing any work in class julie deals with a creepy boyfriend the inflexible administration at st splatter counseling unwed mothers and the blank expressionless looks of her students none of it means a darn thing or gets resolved in any meaningful way oh and every once in a while a pov shot comes along and stabs one of the girls to death but dont hold your breath waiting for it theres a red herring killer and then a sadly anticlimactic confrontation with the real killer then its back to the asylum and roll credits  the slow pace and numerous inane subplots seem almost calculated to produce a mounting sense of frustration in the viewer which is helped along by choppy editing coffeecan sound quality and dialog that just doesnt make any sense and the most agonizing thing about this movie is the killers fixation on women  the men in this movie are just so deserving idve paid good money to see someone off the jerk with the pregnant girlfriend or the lunkhead lothario who was fooling around with his girlfriends roommate or any of the creepy priests there aint no justice,negative,0
this was one of the worst movies ive ever seen im still not sure if it was serious or just a satire one of those movies that uses every stupid who dunnit cliché they can think of arrrrgh  don johnson was pretty good in it actually but otherwise it sucked it was over 10 years ago that i saw it but it still hurts and wont stop lingering in my brain   the last line in the movie really sums up how stupid it is i wont ruin it for you should you want to tempt fate by viewing this movie but i garantee you a nghya moment at the end with a few in between if you have nothing better to do and you like to point and laugh then maybe it might be worth your while additionally if youre forced to go on a date with someone you really dont like suggest watching this movie together and theyll probably leave you alone after they see it thats a fair price to pay i guess,negative,0
when this movie was on  what a bore an attempt at humor but really not pulling it off too well some good ideas were cast and the actors makeup and wardrobe were ok  i expected a lot more unfortunately i couldnt sit through any more of it i switched off halfway through the video and ejected the tape went to the rental store to get my money back,negative,0
i first came across my tutor friend accidentally one or two years ago while tv surfing prior to that id never watched any korean films before in my whole life so mtf was really the first korean film ive ever watched and what a delightful surprise i was thoroughly amused from the beginning to end and had a great time laughing its comic style is quite different from those of the hong kong comic films which ive been to used to all my life and hence tired of as well breathing fresh air into my humdrum film viewing experience i thought therere quite a few scenes and tricks in mtf that are pretty hilarious witty and original too  i watched mtf the second time a few days ago and having watched it once already the surprisecomic effect on me kind of mitigated that has however by no means affected negatively my opinion of the film instead something else came through this time it moved me the story about how two young seemingly enemies whore utterly incompatible get thrown together and how they gradually resolve their differences and start caring for each other without realizing the feelings themselves reminds me of the long gone high school days to me su wan and ji hoon are actually compatible as they both have something that is pure and genuine inside them a quality that separates them from people like say ji hoons sassy girlfriend  the film is divided into two distinct parts the 1st part deals with the fight between su wan and ji hoon and is more violent and faster in pace after ji hoon gets a pass in his final examination and su wan dances the in ji hoons opinion provocative dance things start to change the pace slows down and ji hoon suddenly realizes he cares for su wan more than he could ever imagine so the 2nd part deals with the development of their mutual feelings leading of course to a happy ending accompanied by a final showdown with the gang boss  just one last comment i find this to be a bit unbelievable the fact that a 21yearold selfproclaimed bad boy would feel embarrassed being almost naked in front of the girl he bullies and loses his cool is just a little odd i guess that shows that ji hoon is just a boy pure at heart and isnt really what his appearance seems btw kwong san woo ji hoon does have a sexy body and perfect figure    mtf is definitely on my list of top 10 favorite films of all time,positive,1
dont get me wrong i love the tv series of league of gentlemen it was funny twisted and completely inspired i was looking forward to the movie the premise was interesting and i looked forward to see what they had done with the characters and where the bizarre storyline would take them  it was a total disappointment for starters the three weakest characters in the series were the leads and it only contained bit parts for the other characters why not pick mickey  pauline papa lazaro or tubs and edward for the main parts it was unfunny throughout half baked gags and poor slapstick humour  the real clincher was the plain ridiculous period drama  comedy and i will use the word comedy loosely it distracted from the main storyline and felt awkward not to mention painfully unfunny the direction of the movie is appalling and often feels that the lines were delivered by the characters within one take very rushed  then  the three headed plasticineesquire monster what the hell was all that about plain ridiculous it felt like the league of gentlemen tagged it on at the end  all in all i found myself looking at my watch and sighing with disappointment throughout my experience of the film what was once an amazing television series has been tainted by a terribly unfunny film   if i could give it 0 out of 10 i would do not waste your money seeing this,negative,0
christopher nolans directorial debut is a memorable one the film was very well received and help land contracts for making memento and quite rightfully so   following is an exquisite example of how films should be made no fancy effects or blooddripping gorejust brilliant writing and good acting nolan manages to captivate us once again with his writing the actors all unknowns to me and i suppose most people did a good job bringing the characters to live they were all believable and thats all they need to be the film is confusing because it plays with chronology a lot but its very rewarding in the end the films a little short to be a fulllength feature but any additional length wouldve ruined the style of the movie and the brilliance of the writing wouldve been diminished though short the film has every aspect that makes a film attractive imo an intriguing beginning an exciting middle and a surprising end   i dare say following is almost as good as memento his best film by far the scrambled chronology is equally masterful used in both films the amazing plot twists are present and the acting is very good  this film was made with a mere 6000 but the quality is much higher than most almost all million dollar boxoffice hits the use of bw may be a hard pill to swallow for the big audience following is primarily nolan showing off his skills to the studio bosses  and what skills they arerarely have i enjoyed writing so much as in following even pi doesnt even come close imo though its also very good  this is a film surely not to be missed by any selfrespecting movielover if you liked memento following is definitely for you,positive,1
six months after highschool sprinter laura dies during a race a killer begins to murder the rest of the track team using a variety of sports equipment as weapons thats the daft plot of early 80s slasher graduation day a lacklustre addition to the genre that offers very little in the way of style originality or decent gore  what it does deliver however are some stunningly awful musical interludes a few familiar faces including an early appearance from screamqueen linnea quigley and a smattering of nudity a prerequisite of any slasher movie  so forget the death scenestheyre lame and rather bloodlessand instead enjoy the movies more memorably crap elements the rapid editing that can induce migraines and epileptic seizures the roller disco which is accompanied by a prolonged heavy rock song  gangster rock as performed by the unforgettably awful felony an impromptu jamming session by the schools students christopher george hamming it up as chief redherring coach michaels and the cheesy music teacher who letches after his female students who for some reason find him quite irresistible  towards the end of the film the action picks up a little with the discovery of the slaughtered kids bodies under the bleachers and a quite twisted scene featuring lauras corpse in her cap and gown but it all comes way to late in the day to save this film from mediocrity,negative,0
hey remember when hal hartley was brilliant what a time that was id say the book of life was when things really started going downhill but i will say that at least he went uphill from this one a movie that looks like it was filmed on someones cell phone wouldnt have to be a bad thing if it was distinguished by an interesting story and dialog but alas those are missing along with hartleys spare quirky dialog in their place is tedious exposition on themes of christian end of times and a trite story of a modern jesus in a quandary packaged in a tryingtobehip modern world where everyone looks like someone out of a hal hartley movie while it picks up a little in its second half its never enjoyable or especially sensible what the hell happened to you hartley,negative,0
i would like to submit the following goof  during the bridge scene soldiers are seen wading out in the river asking to be taken away and seeking to escape some of the soldiers approach captain willards boat and attempt to board carrying with them suitcases soldiers are not issued nor do they ever carry suitcases into a combat zone they have duffel bags packs and footlockers but not suitcases the use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of keeping additionally if you look closely you will see that the suitcase is floating on top of the water this is probably a very good indication that it is emptyotherwise it would sink,positive,1
if i could rate it a zero i would  coming from someone who likes shockexploitation films of the time and waters overall i must say this is useless  it does nothing  serves nothing  an idiot with a camera and a urge to prove his cleverness by rebeling against social standards is all this comes off as  its entirely amateur  both in principle and execution  it doesnt have a point  its digusting for the sake of disgusting obscene with the wit of a neanderthal  its useless  someone said waters was probably chuckling over all the bad press and disgust others gave with this film  but why if i made a short film depicting a man in a bathroom taking a sht for ten minutes straight surely it would receive the same accomidations but why would i be proud or chuckle at that   would it be because i am so unintelligent that i have to resort to this so i can say ha take that censors and mainstream im so rebellious ill do whatever i want and film it no  waters shouldnt be proud of this mess  fans of waters shouldnt watch it  its useless  that is  without any use  its doesnt even fit under the criteria of art for arts sake  to like or defend this movie is to defend something that was designed purposely as being anticulture to be pushed for the mainstream audience  in modern terms this film is the hot topic of films  useless and obsolete a poser film that demands it be acknowledged as rebellion ,negative,0
this movie is one of my very favorites its hard to explain why maybe its the innocence of corin nemec and his awkwardness paired with the boldness of cheryl pollak but it definitely has something to do with the soundtrack also some of the characters have little lines or movements or moments that are amusing in and of themselves finally the story is one that always tugs at my heartstrings and the last scene is so bittersweet all in all i love this movie its perfect for a gooey sentimental girls night,positive,1
this was an atrocious waste of my time no plot the acting was so far below par it should be used as an exemplar in acting classes of what not to do it is merely a commercial ripoff of the earlier universal soldier which also scrapes the bottom of the acting barrel its sad that vd needs to assert his ego every few years and sadder still that people will pay good money to sit thru it this kind of schlock gives martial arts movies a bad name by comparison it makes segall norris and arnold look almost talented  perhaps vd should take the leslie nielson track and do sendups of his genre at least then we could be laughing with him instead of at him,negative,0
i can not believe i wasted my money to rent this movie i thought it was a porn flick when it started and it never got any better the acting the music drowning out the actors horrible save your money you have to read the movie all the way through bc they knew the music would drowned out the speaking lines i never got the part about the slaughterhouse or the need to continue to show cows and pigs being butchered what did that have to do with the real btk killer i understand why there were no famous actorsactresses in this movie the script would have turned me away within the first page of reading you would be better off watching paint dry,negative,0
i saw this movie because it had a giant person and was labeled as a monster movie i do not understand why it is called a monster movie the movie is a drama i was expecting a lot of destruction but what did i get most of the movie was relationship problems and people thinking that a woman was a loony because she saw a spaceship crash with a giant inside for an unexplained reason the action started a few minutes toward the end since the woman was killed isnt that murder couldnt they have done anything else besides murder her if you watch this because you expect it to have action because it is labeled as a monster movie dont watch it it is not a monster movie it is a drama,negative,0
by strange coincidence ive started to watch this move straight after brice de nice and the good thing was that not many movies could be worst than brice de nice so i was really looking forward for something better which would make me forget this horrible flop  unfortunately oss117 again left me disappointed  i dont know maybe its just problem with translations but since diner de cons i havent seen any french comedy that i would call really good even when i look at the reviews on imdb only people from france are giving the oss117 high notes  for me this movie didnt really work  in some parts is as funny as real bond movies in others jokes were a little bit too predictable or too corny,negative,0

what should have been a routine babysitting gig at a secluded lake house turns into a night of terror as high school student jill johnson camilla belle receives threatening phone calls from a sadistic stalker while trying to stay one step ahead of him  the first 20 minutes of the original film were pretty good but it was all downhill from there the remake takes those first 20 minutes and stretches them into an 80 minute feature film thats a good idea because its eliminating everything that made the original bad however if they wanted this film to work more effectively then they should have hired a better lead actress better director writer etc theres no suspense everything can be figured out long before it happens and its a very dull film since not much happens at least there isnt much to sit through since its less than 90 minutes  if this premise were to work then the lead actress has to give a realistic performance camilla belle gives one of the worst performances i have ever seen and throughout the whole movie she seemed to be reading her lines you get a lead role in a hollywood film that will be viewed by millions of people and you give no effort at all why did they hire this girl sure shes pretty but she cant act at all yet i suppose this wont matter to the target audience who will most likely eat this film up the rest of the cast is bland and forgettable especially the woman who plays the maid rosa even the stranger was lame and his lines on the phone were not effective at all  this movie reminds me of last years disappointing horror film boogeyman that movie was a bunch of cheap scares and false alarms and when a stranger calls is pretty much the same jill enters a room because she hears a noise but its just a false alarm like a cat or the maid this type of scene happens over and over again until finally after about 50 minutes the stranger appears he has to be one of the lamest killers ever he carried no weapons and didnt seem to pose much of a threat the ending is bad but it matches the rest of the film so it doesnt really matter the film is directed by simon west and he is really bad at building up suspense he was using every cliché he could think of and the results werent very good the house was amazing and ill give the film credit for that it was an isolated house so it was pretty creepy but thats about the only good thing this film has to offer in the end if youre not a teenage girl then you should skip the movie rating 210,negative,0
first of all the only reason people keep bitching about this film is because they cant stand a few parts of the true story being altered well guess what peter jacksons film wasnt a perfect rendition either well enough ranting this is a very beautiful film the backgrounds are gorgeous and taken from well known tolkein artists the film covers about half the trilogy fellowship of the ring and up to the battle of helms deep in the two towers and moves at a good pace the voice casting is top notch and the most of the characters look like i imagined they would samwise is a bit too ugly for my tastes but aragorn looks awesome the film has a great score that completely supports the movie if you enjoy good fantasy stories but hate reading the books are even better give this movie a try keeping in mind it was made 20 odd years ago  also of particular note peter jacksons adaption of fellowship follows almost exactly the same strand as ralph bakshis jackson has said many times how much he admired bakshis effort,positive,1
well i can and will be very short this is a wrongbalanced nonconvincing film that could have been a little bit better the script seems to not know which way to go  from funny to clichewise serious its a bit silly that plus too much sentences we have heard before the hacker is in florida or no he is in madrid no he is in   he is screwing the signal   4 out of 10,negative,0
a wornout plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case  the equally wornout plot of an outsider on the inside who eventually is shut out  with such an outstanding case one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins but scene after scene drones by with no change in intensity no character arcs and inexplicable behavior  the homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary  or on the other hand completely unexplored it seemed to be included only to titillate the viewers when will hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically make a more compelling picture  a regrettably dreadful movie when will lauren bacall pick a good one i expected better of her and kristin scott thomas this one is definitely one to miss,negative,0
halloween is one of the best examples of independent film its very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance it is a simple movie told very well the music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores if you havent seen this movie yet you must check it out the cast is all terrific i wish they had never made sequel after sequel the first one was by far the best and should have ended like it did without having a sequel it was fun to see jamie lee curtis in the movie she hasnt seemed to age shes just as gorgeous today without the hairdo and seventies clothes the scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever,positive,1
in contrast to my fellow reviewers i always try to find something redeeming in any film i seeyes the quality of the dubbing and lighting is abysmal the acting is wooden and the opening sequence highly misleading what with all those lascivious female lesbian vampires with blood drippingsomething must be lost in the translation of the word bloodsucker from the italian in the title almost as if the producers were originally going to film a gothic vampire tale and then changed their minds but could not afford to give up their dramatic opening sequence so tacked it onto the film anyway  this film made in 1975 has recently been issued on dvd and comes with its own theatrical trailer which in some respects is more daring than seen in the filmnow anyone who buys this film has probably already read its synopsis anyway and knows what to expect  italian softporn from the mid 1970si bought it because i am attracted to christa nelli credited most often as krista nellthe absence of a cast of characters i find most frustrating in a lot of these eurosleaze films from the 60s  70si had hoped imdb would show the cast of characters as one hears their names in the film but without a cast list it is very difficult to link them to the actor concernedi think krista nell played cora but underneath that massive hair style costume and makeup it is difficult to distinguish her for sure  there is mostly a two dimensional portrayal by the actors of their parts and no one really stands outmaybe something is lost in the dubbing processwhat were the positive pointswell the music was atmospheric and of course if youre into beautiful lesbian soft porn its therethe external locations used were good and i would like to know where they filmed the castle on its islandit purports to be set in ireland north or the republicin 1902 so everyone sports period piece costumessome of the scenes i found unintentionally funny especially those sex scenesanyway an enjoyable rompi rated it 410,negative,0
i love this show its clever and very well acted david morse and andre braugher have great chemistry the writing is clever and subplots generally give great comic relief after every new episode im always amazed how thought provoking and at the same time entertaining this show is my only complaint would be donna murphys absence at this point in the second season as david morse exwife heather she added such character to the show  i think this show is a credit to the crimedrama genre with that said  i can not for the life of me understand why this show has such a low rating would someone please who gave this show a 1 rating back it up with a critique,positive,1
one of the worst theatrical movies of the year if not all time anthony hopkins belittles himself by even appearing in this joke i cant believe david mamet and ridley scotts name appear on this travesty the best career move jody foster ever made was turning this one down julianne moore was as emotionless throughout as a female keanu reeves gary oldman was of course his brilliant self he is a crippled victim of hannibal and the makeup is so good i didnt know it was gary until the final credits but eaten by trained boars give me a break rumor has it that he didnt want his name even mentioned in the credits and frying and feeding his own brain to ray liottai was laughing at the absurdity no make that stupidity of this flick at this point i havent seen so many people walk out of a movie since whos that girl  pay someone else to go for you if you must but miss this one at all cost,negative,0
i got a few laughs out of this one more than a lot of other so called comedies the big ship was a knockout and getting to see a lot of its scenery was fun as was getting to see some of dyan cannons curves this wasnt the height of lemmons and mattheaus career but it wasnt a total dog as some suggest,positive,1
soon americans would swarm over a darkened damaged england preparing to invade europe but in 1937 the picture of hip americans in the sunny slightly ridiculous english countryside was an appealing idyllic diversion american dancing star  heartthrob jerry halliday astaire on a european tour  weary of the screaming female crowds generated by the lurid propaganda of his manager burns is unwittingly caught up in the marriage prospects of frustrated heiress lady alice marshmorton fontaine the tale is complicated by a betting pool among the marshmorton servants that is run by and rigged for head butler keggs gardiner whos betting on lady alices cousin reggie noble the favorite of alices stuffy domineering aunt collier the story would have been much better as a halfhour tv episode the usual wodehouse plot devices of mistaken identity and jumps to wrong conclusions wear thin in a fulllength film both alice  jerry appear impossibly and annoyingly clueless by the second half of the film the amusement park interlude  the climax in the castle are too long  begin to drag fontaine is too beautiful too dignified  too quiet to be a ditzy blonde no matter how aristocratic while young footman albert watson is painfully awful but while damsel is a pretty diminutive vehicle for so much talent the talent doesnt let us down astaires romantic comedy skill is no less enjoyable here than in any of his films with ginger rogers and his dance scenes both solo  with burns  allen are up to par though his one dance with novice hoofer joan is necessarily tame gracie nearly steals the whole show as georges bubbly secretary who is at once airheaded conniving  coolly selfconfident her scene with solid character actor gardiner as the devious snob keggs is a oneofakind classic this  astaires priceless scene with the madrigal singers give damsel a delightful color of naive but noblespirited americans mixing with noble but dullspirited englishmen gershwin is at the top of his game with nice work if you can get it  stiff upper lip which carry the film through its weak points and is there another film where madrigals get a gershwin swing treatment damsel is more than a piece of trivia for those who might want to see astaire without rogers or fontaine before she was a real star its a fine diversion as entertaining as any of the vaudevillian musical comedies that ruled the 1930s but will never be made again,positive,1
fragglerock is excellent in the way that schindlers list was excellent a great watch for children and adults of all genders big noses can be seen as hinting towards phallic symbols in the same way that hr puff n stuff had hinted towards marijuana smoking your kids will love this movie i enjoyed it very much as a child my father showed me this movie as a child he enjoyed it as well and pointed out that the exaggerated noses were phallic symbols although at the time i had no clue about what those were the movie is comedy and adventure the storyline is wacky and cheerful i and you shall enjoy this together,positive,1
i usually much prefer french movies over american ones with explosions and car chases but this movie was very disappointing there is no way to write a spoiler because nothing really happens this french couple has been living in lisbon for years and they return to paris for a friends wedding they announce to another friend they are having dinner with that they are going to split then nothing much happens they dont seem to know whether they want to separate or not i dont necessarily think that their hesitations make for a bad movie it is very human to hesitate before making such a decision for good but this could be treated in an interesting manner giving some flesh to their desires and their relationship but that does not happen one gets out of the theater unsure of why these two got together or want to split the only piece i enjoyed was the conversation with the drunk that was true to life,negative,0
wow probable the worst movie i have ever seen this person should never make another moviei cant believe anyone would have produce this in good conscienceyou have have wasted every cent no concept of real life i have wasted 2 hours of my life i will never get back ever everyone who worked on this show should be embarrassed im embarrassed for them all of you should be ashamed if i was gay i would want to tell the director that they have personally set back gay rights progress by 5 years please never watch this moviei have never written a blogg about a film before but the distaste for this film has compelled me to do so,negative,0
how this film gains a 67 rating is beyond belief it deserves nothing better than a 20 and clearly should rank among imdbs worst 100 films of all time national treasure is an affront to the national intelligence and just yet another assault made on american audiences by hollywood critics told of plot holes you could drive a 16 wheeler through  i love the justifications for this movie being good nicholas cage is cute come on people no wonder people around the world think americans are stupid this has to be the most stupid insulting movie i have ever seen if you wanted to see an actually decent film this season consider kinsey the woodsman million dollar baby or sideways national treasure unfortunately got a lot more publicity than those terrific films i bet most of you reading this havent even heard of them since some havent been widely released yet  nicholas cage is a terrific actor  when he is in the right movies time after time ive seen cage waste his terrific talent in awful mindnumbing films like con air the rock and faceoff when his talent is put to good use like in charlie kaufmans adaptation he is an incredible actor  bottom line  id rather feed my hand to a wood chipper than be subjected to this visual atrocity again,negative,0
spoilers ahead for the first ten minutes or so of star witness were introduced to a quote typical urban american family unquote in a nameless city which is another way of saying warner brothers version of nyc except for the young children including the charming dickie moore and sprightly sally blane theyre a pretty dreary lot and their dinner table conversation is tedious and we wish the story would move along and bring in the star walter huston but wait folks wait all of a sudden serious gangster movie action breaks out drawing the family in against their will and after that this baby never lets up theres suspense an oscarnominated script good acting everything you want old movies to beit is here i do question chic sales performance he must be an acquired taste but his presence turns out to be crucial to the plot hes treated to special status in the credits so warner bros must have really been high on sale but how his corny old man routine fit in with the public then is something lost to me perhaps it is lost to time period an unknowable factor you had to be a 1931 moviegoer to understand also the climax is typically melodramatic nevertheless this right now is the best release of the studio that year i have seen so far however ive only seen eight so perhaps thats an inconclusive view do not miss this when tcm shows it 8 out of 10,positive,1
stunning absolutely stunning this is a movie about two kids whos father suddenly has a vision he claims an angel visits him and tells him that they need to kill demons he gets instructions later and they start rounding up the demons which are to the naked eye ordinary people they kill these socalled demons with an ax to the head and chop them up burying them in the rosegarden their father claims he can see their sins when he touches them the movie continues with a twist at the end  the thing that i love about this movie is that it perfectly captures the frailty of human perception is their father completely mad or is he telling the truth the audience is left to decide go make the judgment for yourself and see the movie now,positive,1
updating of the clare booth luce play and the 1939 movie is a major disappointment the cast of women is excellent most of the individual scenes work but nothing hangs together there is no connection from scene to scene almost as if the film was crafted in parts and then assembled in a vacuum granted the story of a woman dealing with her husbands infidelity and how she is helped and hindered by her friends is a less shocking one now in an age when divorce is so common but at the same time its just as timely as ever i just wish they could have managed to connect all of the pieces together because as it stands now you really dont feel pulled along by the plot wait for cable,negative,0
scary movie 3 2003 was a bad idea to begin with the last film was a mediocre effort put it next to this load its a comedy classic whilst part two was filled with a lot of dated humor and cheap shots at least it was funny theres nothing funny about forced humor jokes pratfalls and sight gags are supposed to be naturally funny hitting the viewer over the head with tired jokes is not cool the humor in this film was caters to juvenile imbeciles wholl laugh at anything when they catered to the junior high school crowd any sense of self respect was tossed out the window ring parodies are not funny i have watched them in comedies since 1998 theyre so dated michael jackson jokes are not cool either whats even worse is making fun of two broken down has been performers whose best days were never  the death of american cinema has been a slow one films like this are the nails that are being pounded into its coffin whatever happened to real humor i havent laughed out loud in a movie theater in a long time too many bad movies rot the brain you want proof go to your local mega chain video rental store and see whats on the shelves this movie is bad dont believe the hype i would rather watch scary movie 2 in a continuous loop than to suffer through this poor excuse of a comedy ever again  definitely not recommended unless you have a handful of brain cells,negative,0

an unusual movie which starts off with the classic premise of a hooligan who marries a girl who loves him in order to escape the country but a twist soon turns the tale upside down most of the film hits the right buttons the story develops smoothly acting is solid sienna millers drawl is priceless she really can act chemistry between both leads works and rolling american rural scapes and quirky side characters really make for a good time the mood which starts off as light and romantic soon moves into something darker and downright eery at times  at times though the pace slows just a tad more than we would like but dont let this stop you watching this unusual little cinematic treat alexandre montin paris,positive,1
after reading the other tepid reviews and comments i felt i had to come to bat for this movie  roegs films tend to have little to do with one another and expecting this one to be like one of his you liked is probably off the mark  what this film is is a thoughtful and unabashed look at religious faith the only other film like itin terms of its religious messagewould have to be tolkins the rapture  i am astonished that anyone could say the story is muddled or supernatural it is a simple movie about catholic faith miracles and redemptionthough you would never guess it till the end it is also the only movie i can think of whose resolution turns literally on a pun  as a happily fallen catholic myself i know what the movie is about and i find a sort of fondness in its ultimate innocence about the relation between god and man but if you are not familiar with the kind of theology on which the film is based then it will go right over you head  as a filmas opposed to a storycold heaven it is not groundbreaking while the rapture is heavy with pictorial significance and cinematic imagery cold heaven downplays its own cinematic qualities there are no striking shots no edgy effects no attempts to fit the content to the form it is workmanlike shooting but subdued nor does it have dialogue or acting to put it in a class of high drama it is a simple story that unfolds simply it may seem odd but at the end the mystery is revealed it looks ambiguous but with a single line the ambiguity vanishes in a puff of catholic dogma  in this regard cold heaven has at its heart exactly the same sort of thing that drives a movie like the sting or the sixth sense or final descent or polanskis a pure formality all of these are films with a trick up their sleeves they may frustrate you along the way but they have a pointan obvious one indeedbut the fun is at least in part in having been taken in  still even if it seems like little more than a shaggy dog story with a punch line it is worth watching for way it directsand misdirectsyou try itespecially if you are or have ever been a catholic,positive,1
creature unknown is the right word for this movie or maybe it should be called unknown movie this movie is a piece of crap right from the beginning it has a really stupid plot really pathetic acting and soso special effects   some thirtysomething year old postteens are trapped in the woods with a mad reptilian rubbersuit creature lurking around endlessly what you get with this movie is a bunch of talk and precious little action you have girls walking through the woods talking and then you have guys with heavy mascara on walking through the woods talking the whole thing is so boring  the creature itself is rarely seen throughout most of the movie when it is shown the picture is distorted to mask the fact that it is a man in a rubber suit and the movement shows that it is a suit hence the reason for the blurring and distortion of the image   this is not a good movie in any since of the word and the ones here who have praised it are most likely the people that were picked up off the street to act in this truly stupefying movie skip this one for certain,negative,0
not the funniest movie everbut i have to watch this film at least once a year just so i can fall in love with michelle johnson all over again she never looked better than she did in this film by the way the story is good too,negative,0
that this poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase was heralded at sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers these days  first of all there is such a thing as the art of cinematography just picking up a 16mm camera and pointing it at whomever has a line does not make for a real movie  i guess we have to consider ourselves lucky the director didnt pick up someones camcorder  second indie films are supposed to be about real people theres nothing real in this film none of the characters come across as being even remotely human  what they come across as being is figments of the imagination of a writer trying to impress his buddies by showing them how cool and edgy he is  sorry but this is not good writing or good directing  what is left is a husk of a bad movie that somehow made its way to sundance hard to believe this was one of the best films submitted  in any case it made me loose what was left of my respect for the sundance brand,negative,0
i use imdb very much mainly reading comments of other people about movies i´ve or not seen i´ve thought it was time to write a few words about this movie that changed my life and the way i look a movie i think i have seen it at least a dozen times since autumn 94 when i saw it in the theatre for the first time  i feel kieslowski is one of the best directors of all time and i think this is his best one it was his last one i was very sad the day i knew he has died because sure we lost the chance to get something more from him  red is just the best kieslowski  incredibile performance by trintignant  jacob  cinematography by sobocinski if you haven´t seen it look for it if you have just come back to it  red just a masterpiece please forgive my poor english reader,positive,1
slow and nice images changed one another with sometimes annoying music you know bjork in background for the first 75 of the movie if you did not have enough sleep thats a good time   but in the last 20 of the movie director decides to bring idea of rebirth reincarnation or else through sm images spiritual lovers are cutting each others bodies with knives for me it was very much disturbing and actually changed general impression of blend of abstract art and images of modern japanese mystery   operator and director are great but weird   did not enjoy it at all,negative,0
i admire the effort of trying to reach out to the rest of the world with this tragic story however the movie is done so badly that most people i know couldnt sit through it the movie was relevant to me since i lived in estonia when these events took place but it is written horribly and fails to capture the attention of someone who knows nothing on the matter the music choices do not flow well with the movie it seems as if someone just turned a cd player on in the background to put the actors in the mood the acting well what acting the only people acting are jürgen prochnow and donald sutherland even though prochnow seems uncomfortable in this role as far as the relationship development goes between erik westermark jürgen prochnow and julia reuter greta scacchi it is like watching a train wreck there is absolutely no chemistry and it is painful to witness their sincere moments this is not a good movie there is a difference between trying to get a message out couldve been a documentary and trying to make a good movie this is a failure and anyone here who says otherwise makes me wonder if they are trying to promote it as a matter of fact as a native of estonia i am offended by this miserable effort this tragedy deserves more than just a homemade lowbudget ghost chase excuse of a movie this could have been much more,negative,0
i understand this movie was made on a very low budget but that is no excuse for the monstrosity that is grendel deathstalker the throne of fire barbarian queen conquest the invincible barbarian were all done on shoestring budgets and poor special effects yet they still managed to create cult classics by adding some scantily clad women warriors and a good sense of humor the primitive costumes dark castles and beautiful bulgarian landscape gave grendel the potential to be a very good low budget sword and sorcery film but the makers completely ruined this opportunity by using extremely poor cgi effects and colorless characters compare this film to beowulf 1999 it may not be citizen kane but it is a good example of how an entertaining low budget scifi adventure movie can be made by using credible special effects and appealing characters,negative,0
this movie could have been a decent bmovie if 34 of the the movie wasnt so much focusing on the sex scenes i mean hes a sex addict and im sure that theres a lot more that goes on with sex addicts outside of having sex on a constant basis michael des barres did a good job considering what all he had to do which wasnt much at one point or another one would have to laugh at him because his character was so pitiful nastassja kinski was alright in her role as the concerned sex therapist she couldve of done more though and im not suggesting her having sex the person that stood out the most to me in this movie was rosanna arquette in her convincing role as the loving and concerned wife theres something about beautiful inside and out that strongly appeals to me she played that role and as you watched the movie you start to feel bad for her  diary of a sex addict while not oscar material or a modern classic to anyones standards is quite informative and does a fair job in showing you how ones personal demons can take over and ruin the very things in life you think highly of,negative,0
welcome to collinwood is a lot of things but it is none of the following  a george clooney star vehicle unfunny unoriginal  and yes i know the basis for the movie is another movie but as far as hollywood goes this may rank with their most authentic outputs this decade  and for me it does  the movie is from start to finish an absolute gas heres why  there isnt a bad performance in the film the funny parts are funny the edgy parts are edgy the script contains not a dull moment of dialogue the cinematography is fresh and yes beautiful and it doesnt conform to the hollywood norm youll see what i mean when you see the film  when i was a kid i remember seeing advertisements for the film this film went under the radar after not grossing much at the box office and isnt even a cult classic the reason why transformers 2 is seen as acceptable by average movie goers is because they are used to seeing transformers 2 if films as original and funny as this were pumped out as often as multimillion pieces of st the cinematic experience would be a much fresher place    when they say they dont make em like they used to they didnt see welcome to collinwood  a fun minimasterpiece of caper comedy that refuses to compromise one of my favourites,positive,1

one of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history zodiac killer offers an imaginative take on the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killers the filmmakers create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer and anyone who remembers zodiac will be intrigued others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal unlike many serial killers zodiac was not insane at all but very methodical and a selfpromoter the director here plays viewer expectations and pulls it off the film is constructed as a murder mystery or a cold casestyle thriller it is an intelligent investigativeproceduralstyle horror film that will putoff gorehounds in search of cheap thrills  some people dislike any movie that is shot on video this attitude is very oldstyle and provincial it is an attitude and view of movies that puts technical issues above entertainment value or artistic value these attitudes are on the way out zodiac killer is a lowbudget film no doubt but discerning viewers will look beyond that and find a carefullycrafted gem,positive,1
the plot of in the mood for love is simple enough a married man and a married woman though not to eachother slowly develop a romantic attachment to one another the films pace is numbingly slow and precious little actually happens between the two yet the backdrop of hong kong in the early 1960s and director wong karwais keen sense for capturing the beauty of the setting as well as the principal characters make this film a joy to watch actors tony leung and maggie cheung are both excellent and wong karwai has done an extraordinary job in capturing the feel and nostalgia of the past something so many films and directors try to do but usually fail miserably there are so many little details that add charm to the film a trademark of the director and the colors and cinematography are what send this otherwise simple story over the top as a marvelous cinematic achievement 910,positive,1
i went in to this movie thinking it was going to be the next clerks but left feeling let down the humor was weak and the characters fairly flat that isnt to say it was all bad the idea of the dating service in the grocery store seemed like pretty fertile material but the director switched focus to the cliched save the momandpop store from the evil corporation guy i felt like if he would have just stuck with the dating service plot he would have come out with a much more memorable movie now to do the film justice i am from the rochester area and loved the way he portrayed webster in fact the best kevin smith of clerks homage here was giving props to his hometown webster ny is to checkout what red bank nj is to clerks the director wisely threw in a date at nick tahous trust me as far as things to do in rochester a garbage plate is at the top of the list i was lucky enough to see this film at the little in rochester so everybody knew when the odes to the town came up and appreciated them,negative,0
the one and the only  the only really good description of the punk movement in the la in the early 80s also the definitive documentary about legendary bands like the black flag and the x mainstream americans repugnant views about this film are absolutely hilarious how can music be so diversive in a country of supposed libertyeven 20 years afterfind out  ,positive,1
i saw this movie in blockbuster and thought it might be a good sunday evening movie when there is nothing else to do so i bought it used 3 dvds for 25 although it was cheap my money would have been better spent on a nail to drive through my foot  the film started out nicely kinda dark and mysterious i was always enthralled with vampire and samurai movies as a kid i thought the combo would be really cool the first fight scene was pretty cool i was excited for the rest of the movie then the movie took a serious nose dive  i understand that this was a big hit in the east i guess because of the twins i dont see it though this movie aside from the first 10 minutes was absolutely horrible so many movies in this genre have the potential to be great and blow it terribly this is just another casualty  jacki chans role in this film doesnt make any sense at all whyyyyyyyy complete silliness he probably made a few bucks off it though  the only cool thing in this movie are the swords they use nice idea  i wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone,negative,0
i remember watching this series avidly every saturday evening it was the highlight of the week i loved everything about it the location the costumes the actors and the wonderful music by clannad i still have their legend album i loved the way they solved the problem of michael praed leaving by creating another robin this time the earl of huntingdon i believe there were legends of several robins in medieval times another thing i loved was the fact that it was filled with young actors im sure robin and his men would have young after all people didnt live that long in those days other robins always look too old kevin costner with his ridiculous accent looked like robins granddad the only sad thing was the ending its a shame they couldnt at least have done a one off special to tie up all the loose ends and give it a happier ending,positive,1
i have mixed emotions about this film especially as it compares to its forerunner  an american werewolf in london that film had its funny moments it was still more of horror tale than anything else this updated version now set in paris does not have that edge at all and simply isnt in the same classbut it does have some good things going for it that the first film did not have and overall its still fun to watch   so werewolf purists aside most of whom think this film is pure garbage compared to the london version ill still give it decent marks since i dont care what others think i liked it even though i agree london is better and i prefer that version too   the first 3040 minutes of this movie is strictly played for laughs including a hysterical scene with a balloon in a restaurant it also introduces the lead female character played by julie delpy i dont see enough of this actress she doesnt seem to make that many films or least ones i hear about over here in america this french actress has a face that is classic beauty so the film got points for having her in it and she looks great  when the horror starts it can get scary and the special effects are good i also liked the lack of profanity in this film unlike the first one no fwords and no lords name in vain  amazing  however there are plenty of sexual remarks and there is one scene with a guy running out of bar tied to a cross which was blasphemous to me the soundtrack is heavy metal which isnt appealing to a middleaged guy like me either this film is geared a lot more toward 20somethings if that helps anyone  its entertainingjust dont expect it to live up to the first film,positive,1
a fine romantic comedy errol flynn shows what a deft touch for comedy he possessed a talent that probably shows some of his true prankster self the comedic writing on this film is excellent eleanor parker does a nice job as flynns ex wife whom errol is trying to win back eleanor is also easy on the eyes the sets exude 1940s glamour and style where appropriate  flynns comedic timing and wit are displayed to full effect here watch his double takes his ability to verbally counter punch with a snappy comeback or act the straight man and his total believability and sincerity where required this guy could act it is a shame errol did not get a chance to do more roles like this throughout his career he was multitalented to the extreme if you enjoyed it happened one night with gable and colbert or some of the william powell and myrna loy comedies you will enjoy this  well paced and lots of laughs a lost diamond of a movie,positive,1
ok what to say about actium maximus  there are some bad movies that are so horribly awful they circle round to awesome there are bad movies that just suck in their own right there are good movies and soso movies and movies that are just fun then theres actium maximus you cant make a spoiler for this movie because to do that you would have to understand the action enough to comment this particular movie is worse than turkish star wars one and the sequel too those movies are so bad they circle round to awesome and they make you feel drunk even if youre stone cold sober actium circles round from bad to awesome but then it doesnt stop there it takes another trip to badville then round again to awesome then finally it sets up a little feudal kingdom on the border of bad and stock footage of paint drying while a harpy screams incoherently if you are into self punishment this movie is for you it actually will cause your brain to hurt,negative,0
this was a very daring film for its day it could even be described as softcore porn for the silent era it was a talkie but dialog was extremely limited and in german one did not need it anyway  the young 19 hedy lamarr gets trapped in a loveless marriage to an obsessive stereotype german and after a short time in a marriage that was apparently never consummated returns home to her father  in a famous and funny scene she decides to go skinny dipping one morning when her horse is distracted by another she is then forced to run across a field chasing after it as she left her clothing on the horse an engineer retrieves her horse and returns her clothing  after getting an eyeful  they sit for a while and in a zen moment he presents her with a flower with a bee sitting on top this is where she thinks back to her honeymoon and the actions of her husband and an insect she knows this man is different  she returns home and eventually seeks out our young fellow and finds the ecstasy she was denied you can use your imagine here but his head disappears from view and we see her writhing with pleasure since he never got undressed you can imagine certainly an homage to women by the director gustav machatý and a shock to 1933 audiences  the only thing that mars this beautifully filmed movie is the excessive guilt and a strange ending,positive,1
where do i start first off the story sucks the acting sucks the effects really suck i guess ill start with the story the story for komodo vs cobra number one it doesnt explain how or when the komodo and the cobra even got there or for that matter how it was created the acting terrible it seems like the director just pulled a few people from the street which is probably what he did and last and definitely the least the effects they are so horrible that the komodo doesnt even look like a komodo just a dinosaur that looks incredibly unrealistic the water doesnt even move when the cobra appears all in all terrible piece of crap dont even think about renting it,negative,0
midnight cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in 1969 drawing an x rating by todays standards it would be hard pressed to pull an r rating jon voight who has been better is competent in his role as joe buck an out of town hick wanting to make it big with the ladies in new york city he meets a seedy street hustler named ratso rizzo who tries to befriend buck for his own purposes the two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic as ratso dustin hoffman simply shines hoffman has often been brilliant but never more so than in this portrayal he is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison losing the academy award to john wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences director schlessinger has a deft hand with his production but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer worth seeing for hoffmans performance alone,positive,1
this is indeed a spectacularly bad film but it is the rare kind of badness that is endlessly jawdroppingly entertaining i want to add to the other comments on this film  the rock band on the plane look like three skinny drunks from casual labor wearing bad wigs  watch for the severe continuity problem with the kids stuffed tiger it turns into a lion a leopard and back again its filthy or clean depending on the shot  spoiler the stuffed tiger turns into a real animal to save the kid and the writers  the sight of little jimmy floating down the amazon in a coffin clutching his stuffed tiger and squalling away will stick permanently in your memory   listen for one of the most inept sound effects ever late in the story when the priest is setting out to find jimmy the guide demands his monks robes as paymentthe priest drops on one knee in a moment of resigned contemplation and there is the sound of a bell not the deep bonnnng of a church bell but the ding of a bell from a boxing match  this is an absolute hoot to watch,negative,0
i think that the costumes were excellent and the hairdressers also performed well it has the very authentic feeling for that period of time  i dont know if it was the computer magic or if it was real some of the big scenes have hundreds of extras in the background i was especially impressed with the scene of that bridge  the main character the actress also performed well she showed us a nervous witty woman who knows how to use herself to seduce men to get what she wants  some of the scenes were hilarious even though it was about 2 hours long but it was never boring a very good entertaining movie,positive,1
a remarkable piece of documentary giving a vivid depiction of a country deeply divided within itself for further evidence check out some of the comments on imdb compares extremely favourably with oliver stones comandante which is mainly an indepth examination of fidel castros nostril hairs i dont know whether chavez is everything he presents himself as being or yet another in the long line of populist latinamerican caudillos nor do i know whether he will be able to make good on the huge expectations he has clearly built up among the poor majority of venezuelans its hardly reasonable to expect a film like this to be able to answer such questions  but ive certainly now got a pretty vivid idea of whats at stake and what it feels like to be caught up in the middle of a coup someone says in the film were making history and thats exactly what the film feels like its capturing outstanding stuff,positive,1
id love to see some tiein between nightbreed the fury and the xmen series sort of the way the second outer limits series would tiein particular stories and plotlines after the fact to create a story arc although one was never intended id also like know if some more information  anecdotal or otherwise exists anywhere about the relationship andor collaboration between clive barker and david cronenberg i simply cant get my mind around the fact that david cronenberg appeared as a mere actor in a clive barker film does any additional information on the subject actually exist finally its been 17 years since the film was released and i had hoped there wouldve been a sequel by now does anyone out there know if there were any plans in the making that never came to fruition or if in fact there are plans even now for a sequel,positive,1
theres potential in there with tell noone a curious and intriguing plot and a french take on a very american story but for me the opportunities were not exercised here  although i liked aspects of this film there were three prominent failings which pulled it right down to four out of ten  firstly its a silly clichéd murder mystery a particularly contrived murder she wrote or bergerac being french doesnt eliminate this problem  its just silly and in french at the same time its full of implausible coincidences  secondly the transition from the us to france seems to have failed chronically this french doctor hanging out on the streets of a french city with his new homies and their blingin suvs and then theres the car chases  but thirdly and mostly its just too darn long to me a film needs a good reason to be significantly over 90 minutes and over two hours takes some serious justification this once didnt have it,negative,0
comedy works best when it relates to stuff thats true but even as such some effort is required to make jokes that everyone likes and even the most grumpy of viewers can crack a smile when i look at the daily show i see the whole its funny because its true thing but i dont however see the effort and often times i dont if theyre being funny or just trying to make a pointi notice this mostly in the interview segments the daily show started off as a news parody by definition they poke fun at how the media plays its own news by pretending to be inept and dumb news reporters and anchormen and they tackled tons of subjects from science to movies and sometimes politics then jon stewart came alongand it all went to hell thr first years of jon stewarts reign were arguably golden i though he was so funny but then 2004 came along and its where you start to notice a huge chance in the show from there on the shows humor has gone stale colbert left steve carell left many of the shows best anchors left and now its mostly about jon stewart and the shows gone from a parody to a semiserious news show essentially evening news but with some gags here and there for those who havent seen the show and are having trouble finding out what to watch on cable ill give you a brief description of what the shows aboutat least until 2009 bush cheney and all republicansunless they happen to embrace an opinion shared by democrats as well are stupid evil corrupt and hypocrites anyone who stands by conservative beliefs is also evil corrupt and a hypocrite people who doubt the manmade global warming theory are evil and stupid vote democrat there i saved you 25 minutes of your time go watch something else at first i though that the producers hijacked the show for their own personal political agenda but when i actually see the interviews it becomes crystal clear what this shows aboutwhat i mentioned above but ill get to that in a moment frist off the humor in the daily show according to jon stewart expects you to find a random filmed quote said by either bush cheney or a random republican humorous because well because jon sets up the joke setting it in writers specific context and expects that the random quote somehow delivers the punchline so unless you «get» the context its entirely useless as bankable humor also the daily show expects you to laugh when they show a montage of one politician talking and in another separate video saying another thing again putting into a context that the writers expect you to understand thus making it funnywhy well because jon said so now imagine the daily show using that formula countless times for years every week and youll start to understand of what used to be a laughfest that is now 25 minutes of just silent staresyes even in the lewis black segments at first some decent amount of effort was put into these jokes but now much less of that is apparent and the interview have the most odd sense of bias that ive ever seen jon stewart calls bill oreilly a bully but what does that make him when he sucks up to every single actor and democratjohn kerry before obama today that appears on the show and looks down upon respected republicans and accomplished conservative newsmen such as weekly standards own bill kristol he puts them in some sort of peoples tribunal as if theyre being charged with a crime often times any person on the show who stands up for bush is portrayed as delusional as if that persons out of touch with reality and assumes he speaks for the majority of america thats the de facto treatment for anybody conservative unless they happen to share a similar point of view with democrats if so thens its an endless love fest but still it doesnt matter in the eyes of jon you are already wrong before you walked into the show and are still wrong afterwords thats the kind of treatment you get if you are anything remotely rightwing now you have to wonder what that could possibly have anything to do with humor one wonders whatll happen if democrats win the white house,negative,0
it must be said that the director of the cell tarsem singh has quite handily established himself with his first feature which happens to rank as one of the most visually astounding films in contemporary cinema  the cell is more of a visceral experience than a film as a thriller it rises above most of its peers with competent editing and a chilling score effectively providing an exceptionally suspenseful atmosphere however it is ultimately tarsems skill for elaborate and disturbing set design and imagery that carries the films jolting sense of terror  as with several recent films i have been shocked by the alarming hypocrisy among those who have commented negatively about the cell in defence of the film i will address a few of these issues the plot appears to be the main concern and while it is not revolutionary and borrows heavily from the silence of the lambs it was never intended to be the most important aspect of the film the plot itself is a vehicle through which tarsems visionsimultaneously horrifying and wondrousis presented to the audience much in the same way that the plot of the silence of the lambs is secondary to the fascinating study of its two lead characters lecter and starling while the silence of the lambs is clearly the superior film it is irrational for one to condemn the plot of the cell and in the same breath praise that of the silence of the lambs  my final concern is the mention of mtv style directing it pains me to see the condemnation of directors who use innovative camera and cinematography techniques a camera has the potential to be much more than simply a tool with which to record events angles pans colour adjustment and so forth are all used to their full extent in the cell with the purpose of creating the sense of a dreamlike state that could not have been otherwise achieved this is essential to the film as the entire premise behind it is the visualization of a serial killers subconscious if you simply want a series of static shots stick to stage plays and give up cinema altogether  that being said the cell is thoroughly entertaining terrifying and breathtaking in both its pacing and design anyone who is able to look past theperhaps uninspired yet never dullscreenplay will find one of the best films of the year 2000,positive,1
first off let me say if you havent enjoyed a van damme movie since bloodsport you probably will not like this movie most of these movies may not have the best plots or best actors but i enjoy these kinds of movies for what they are this movie is much better than any of the movies the other action guys segal and dolph have thought about putting out the past few years van damme is good in the movie the movie is only worth watching to van damme fans it is not as good as wake of death which i highly recommend to anyone of likes van damme or in hell but in my opinion its worth watching it has the same type of feel to it as nowhere to run good fun stuff,negative,0
to communicate in film essential things of life  like what is life does it have a meaning  is sheer impossible of course possible answers to these questions are demonstrated in every film story but communication needs a direct appeal to consciousness this happens if the input from the senses overrules the input from our mind ie our thoughts few directors know how to communicate essential things tarkovsky is one his stalker shows images of existence communicates life as it shows itself and yet escapes your mind i think de zee and de graaff do the same,positive,1
i dont know the stars or modern chinese teenage music  but i do know a thoroughly entertaining movie when i see one  kung fu dunk is pure hollywood in its values  its played for laughs for love and is a great blend of kung fu and basketball  everybody looks like they had a lot of fun making this  the production values are excellent  and modern china looks glossier than los angeles here  the plot of the abandoned orphan who grows up in a kung fu school only to be kicked out and then discover superstardom as a basketball play and love and more etc is great  this is fresh fun and immensely entertaining  with great action and good dialogue this is one simply to enjoy  for all ages  and for our money was one of the best family movies were seen in a long time  please ignore the negative reviews and give dunk a chance  we were really glad we did  a good sports comedy movie,positive,1
cybil richards directs another full moonsurrender cinema masterpiece of erotica this time jacqualine lovell dressed in rather fetching silver outfit is tasked with destroying all evidence of sexual activity however she cant resist watching the tapes and she kinda likes them the sex scenes are well filmed and set to a superb soundtrack at least for this sort of film the cast are largely awful and mainly very average looking too jacqueline lovell is her exceptionally attractive self and between viewing the sex files she manages to expose her chest and fumble a little down below she also fits in a little lesbian activity to be honest lovell deserves so much better than this kind of fare here she looks great naked but actually is much more appealing in her silver attire narrating the drama utterly rubbish movie with lovell and soundtrack the only real redeeming features mediocre even for surrenders output and clearly a new budget low for them also,negative,0
i was not really a big fan of star trek until past 23 years thanks to the advent of netflix and post 2000 video technology distribution i am able to embark into the past of all the great star trek episodes for those that dont really watch every single episode and know them by heart through tng ds9 voyager etc general popular consensus will say  i like the next generation the best thats because captain picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of star trek starvation but to be quiet honest i appreciate the creativity of voyagers episodes more than tng voyagers episodes also progresses through time unlike tng granted data from tng is great but it eventually gets old but voyagers doctor  now thats creativity instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky give him the freedom to express beyond anything you imagined not only is picardo such a great actor but the premise setting for his expansive self growth as a doctor self realization now that is science fiction at its best endgame portray him as a husband married to an organic inventing neuroimplant transceiver for humanmachine interface and even  in the episode before endgame to disobey captains order and make human mistakes unlike ds9 which are blessed with 2 beautiful women right from 1st episode voyager has to survive 3 seasons without jeri ryan and i believe it is picardo that carried them with his personality of course the rest of the voyagers cast chemistry just flows effortless harry kim and tom paris  very natural i love tuvoc occasional humor despite being a vulcan finally im so glad they got rid of that original female captain  oh if you get to watch the rare footage  thank god for kate she has developed through the 7 years into an extremely confident believable and respectable female captain what a great job thank you star trek for making voyager i enjoy every episode the creative exploration of possibilities of morals and of our cosmic expanse,positive,1
ive said this in other reviews without a story you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want still no one will give a damn  the director seems to have a great eye for 30s art deco which i love and i think the idea of using all digital backgrounds and such could indeed be the wave of the future in movie making however its obvious the director got so interested in the digital rendering of his movie he forgot to film many scenes which would have enormously helped this surprisingly thinnedplotted film spoiler for crying out loud they forgot to have a villain in this thing ok they have one but hes been dead for 20 years by the time the movie takes place conran misses the point of having a villain as far as action goes well lets see sky captain law shoots down one robot two or three of the flapping wing airplanes before dex ribisi tells him to stop shooting them down and a couple robots but mostly spends his time looking dashing and getting others to fight his battles for him paltrow as polly or peggy or punky or whatever is totally wasted in this movie the reviewer who comments on hers and laws lack of chemistry is so right and i for one got a little sick of seeing repeated shots of the top of her camera showing she only has two shots left both of which she wastes subsequently in the movie one uncomically one quite funny although i saw it coming from 70 years away no one except law and paltrow have any significant time on screen and thats the movies real flaw an audience doesnt identify with robots they need a hero to root for and a visible despicable villain to hate without that plus a good engaging story all the cg in the world wont help,negative,0
i saw this film at the 2005 toronto international film festival based on a novella by science fiction author brian aldiss this film attempts to tell the story of tom and barry howe conjoined twins who are plucked from their family by an impresario in order to form a rock band  almost deliberately gimmicky the film is also too clever by half if youll pardon the pun by mixing genres styles and moods the directors whose previous film was the excellent documentary lost in la mancha lose their way pretty quickly i was never sure whether i was meant to take it all seriously or not flashbacks dream sequences it was all just a bit much plus the promised rock and roll just didnt move me i was reminded a bit too much at times of hedwig and the angry inch a film i found original and moving but in this case the songs just werent as good nor were the main characters sympathetic a more unfavourable comparison would be the similarly disappointing velvet goldmine,negative,0
as a single woman over 40 i found this film extremely insulting and demeaning to single women over 40 not to mention every other woman of any age it was a sad pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a chick flick and it failed miserably andy mcdowell isnt much of an actress to begin with but given the nonexistent plot i hate to even refer to it as a plot in this she didnt have a chance there was no character development no reason to feel sympathyempathy for any of the characters and no attempt to make the film in any way realistic or believable and then theres the obligatory malefantasy of an attractive straight woman suddenly deciding to give lesbianism a try  please  not only do i wish i could get my money back for the dvd rental i also want those 112 minutes of my life back what a ripoff,negative,0
this movie was 100 boring i swear i almost died from boredom at the theater it wasnt funny and didnt really hve that much action in it either it was boring and i hope whoever out there that liked this movie god be with you in the future when you find out what this movie was really like and try to jump off a bridge or something like that,negative,0
this space snippet was kind of dumb i guess it was supposed to be a shocker unexpected ending but imho it was just a huge letdown joseph campanella and the rest of the earthbound actors do a great job in this one their performances are not done justice with such a silly ending though how this ending could ever have made it through any kind of review by the producers is beyond me the other comment on here is not correct the tongue in cheek vignettes only came in during the second season this thing was supposed to be taken seriously the producers and writers could have been a little more creative with the ending to do the rest of the episode justice,negative,0
well this is a typical straight to the toilet slasher film  long story short a bunch of teenagersyoung adults becoming stranded in the middle of creepy woods and get hacked down by naked nymphomaniac demons  this movie has all the basics for this slasher fromage  naked women teens or young adults being marooned in someplace spooky gory death scenes the last survivor being a well built young woman who will always show off her midriff but never bra less a creepy crazy man who knows about the evil lesbian kiss scene sex being a killer no plot  even then for a cheesy slasher film it was really terrible the atmosphere is totally dead nothing not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested watching it felt like it was being watched with a nasty head congestion or a nasty head cold  give the demonic  010,negative,0
five medical students kevin bacon david labraccio william baldwin dr joe hurley oliver platt randy steckle julia roberts dr rachel mannus kiefer sutherland nelson experiment with clandestine near death  afterlife experiences researching for medical  personal enlightenment one by one each medical students heart is stopped then revived  under temporary death spells each experiences bizarre visions including forgotten childhood memories their flashbacks are like childrens nightmares the revived students are disturbed by remembering regretful acts they had committed or had done against them as they experience afterlife they bring real life experiences back into the present as they continue to experiment their remembrances dramatically intensify so much so some are physically overcome thus they probe  transcend deeper into the deathafterlife experiences attempting to find a cure  even though the dvd was released in 2007 this motion picture was released in 1990 therefore kevin bacon william baldwin julia roberts  kiefer sutherland were in the early stages of their adult acting careers besides the plot being extremely intriguing the suspense building to a dramatic climax  the script being tight  convincing all of the young actors make flatliners what is now an allstar cult semiscifi suspense who knew 17 years ago that the film careers of this young group of actors would skyrocket i suspect that director joel schumacher did,positive,1
greta garbos american film debut is an analogy of how our lives can be swept off course by fate and our actions as in a torrent causing us to lose a part of ourselves along the way  greta plays leonora a poor peasant girl in love with ricardo cortezs character don rafael a landowner ricardo is in love with her too but is too easily influenced by his domineering mother leonora ends up homeless and travels to paris where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops the reputation for being a loose woman in reality part of her attitude is bitterness over rafaels abandonment  she returns to her home to visit her family and eventually confronts rafael surprisingly no one knows that shes the famous la brunna and garbo acts up her role as the diva she truly was and re prised with such cool haughtiness in her later portrayals  ricardo cortez reminds one a lot of valentino in looks in this part and he was groomed to be a valentino clone by mgm though he never thought he could be in reality and he was right he is believable in an unsympathetic part as a weak willed mamas boy and allows himself to age realistically but comically at the end of the movie he fails to win leonora when she returns home and later when he follows her his courage is undermined  this movie is beautifully shot with brilliant storm sequences and the sets depicting spain at the time are authentic looking there are also some fine secondary performances by old timers lucien littlefield tully marshall and mack swain  although this is a story of lost love and missed chances i dont think leonora and rafael would have been happy together as he needed a more traditional wife and she was very much a career woman and i dont think would have been happy in a small village the ending is true to life and pulls no punches  see this one as garbos american film debut and a precursor of things to come,positive,1
east palace west palace reminded me somewhat of the detective with frank sinatra in the role of the cop and william windom is the boy its a progressive film for china i guess but it also perpetuates myths about the femininity of gay men much is made of chinese myths in which men take on female roles the movie focuses on an effeminate man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy he cruises the park without fearhe hopes to be taken into the stationhouse by the officer and that in fact happens then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture made to squat for a period of time handcuffed slapped this is what the gay man wants and implicitly the gay man is challenging the cops selfimage as a manly man the storys about the gay mans life which include flashbacks are tolerable but when he starts describing old chinese myths and dramatic works the movie becomes unbearable it becomes a cry of pity for chinas gays who only want to fulfill a traditional role in chinese society sorry i cant relate,negative,0
a woman and her aunt go to scotland to locate her evasive fiancé this is a muchmaligned film because of its denouement but up to that point its interesting wellacted eerie and with fine set design by william cameron menzies developed for 3d projection veronica hurst is captivating and genteel sort of a chic british marilyn monroe still in love with richard carlson who is hiding a family secret in his forbidding castle there are even bats in the belfry it moves leisurely until the final extraordinary setpiece when hurst and her aunt katherine emery also the narrator sneak out of the castle in the night to venture into the maze and find what theyre looking for in its center as a kid i always remembered this sequence  theres nothing scarier or claustrophobic than not finding your way out of a 10foot high maze of hedges naturally the two women get separated setting the stage for engrossing suspense with horrific music the final result is mildly disappointing really since carlsons epilogue at the end makes some sense to all the goingson even provoking sympathy worth seeing,positive,1
the dinner party could quite possibly be in my opinion the greatest adult cinema production of all time it is produced in such an exquisite manner and the actors portray their roles excellently the kitchen scene starring yvonne and juli ashton is magnificent the use of the butter and milk really makes the scene additionally the doctors office scene is well done the campfire scene is filled with enjoyable action though the choice of actors in this scene is questionable asia carreras performance in the junkyard scene is incredible but who would expect anything less from her the closing scene is somewhat over used in adult films but is classic none the less i would highly recommend this film to all fans of adult films and those casual viewers run out to your video store and pick it up today,positive,1

at first glance this film looks like the keifer sutherland series 24 for the big screen with the focus on a plot to assassinate the president of the united states a race against time and plenty of secret service agents the agency under the spotlight in the sentinel  but wait the protagonist turns out to be michael douglas character pete garrison instead a veteran secret service agent famed for taking the bullet for reagan in 1981 the ss agents are specially trained to take the bullet which is what makes them special  who in the right mind will put themselves in the line of a bullet and a target but garrison gets implicated in the assassination plot and has to run for his life while at the same time doing his bit of investigations into the plot all this because of his failure in a polygraph test due to his adulterous banging of the first lady kim basinger tsk  there are shades of clint eastwoods in the line of fire both featured aging actors and aging veteran hasbeen heroes with a bit of a historical reference who took the bullet in their respective tours of duty while eastwoods movie has a more enigmatic villain in john malkovich the sentinel suffered from its lack of a central strong villain preferring to share the assassination responsibility amongst many forgettable exkgb villains and the mole within the presidential detail with douglas on the run from the law he becomes similar to dr richard kimble of the fugitive hunting the proverbial onearmed man while at the same time relying on his smarts to outwit fellow agents which turned out to be quite interesting to watch  despite slick processes it still boils down to the performance and gullibility of individual agents  keifer sutherland and eva longoria top tv stars of today from 24 and desperate housewives get relegated into support roles as the secret service investigators who are looking into garrisons probable involvement in the assassination plot and at times seem to have lept off the pages of csi with their forensics skills the beautiful couple had chemistry that could have resembled xfiles fox mulder and dana scully but alas these two had very little to do here we know the reason why theyre in the movie and that is to get their fans into the theatres also longorias role seemed unable to shake off her sexymama gabrielle and here has her in fairly low cut blouses sutherland actually tells her to cover up and tight pants oglefest for fellow agents  nonetheless its still a pretty interesting look into the lives of probably the most highly charged and tense protection detail in the world and the typical threats that they face daily including the following up on every nutcases threat on the life of the most powerful man in the world its a decent suspense and investigative thriller with enough subplots to keep you entertained but one thing though like most ending action sequences this one has a big enough loophole for you to fly a jumbo jet through,positive,1
spoilers alert  homeward bound the incredible journey is an important film from my life because its the first film i remember seeing in the cinema of my home town as a 4year old scamp the story is based on the sheila burnford novel and is a reason why its not possible to write this one off as a brainless lassie clone  the basic story two dogs and a cat happily live in the seaver family when the new husband to the mother of the three children gets a job in the city and they have to temporarily move into inner san francisco while the animals are sent to a ranch to live for a couple of months the bonds between the animals and the children they watch out for are especially strong and shadow the golden retriever and sassy the himalayan cat are heartbroken as the children are though the young and happygolucky american bulldog known as chance is a little less concerned and somewhat cynical due in part to his voiceover explaining his being abandoned as a pup picked up to an animal shelter and being bought by the family though his growth as a character during the story provides much of the important storytelling  the three pets escape the ranch and head off into the wide and dangerous wilderness fantastic wilderness settings by the way driven on by shadows instincts of direction they meet several perils along the way hoping to make it home while the family and the ranch hosts are suddenly concerned about the animal disappearance there are funny moments all the way through great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines see  memorable quotes and a touching comradeship that grows between the main characters during the course of the storytelling punctuated by moments of sadness such as when sassys arrogance of trying to cross a river without getting wet causes her to fall in the river and get washed down a waterfall leaves a moment of loss that is felt deeply by the viewers  somehow though i fail to see what the inclusion of saving the girl lost in the wilderness adds to the story and the journey they take somehow it seems a little unnecessary as part of the story  the ending cranks the stakes higher when shadow falls into a pit in a trainyard and having hurt his leg finds it hard to get out and gives up exhausted followed by chance climbing in with him to persuade him to climb out telling him how important he is to him and how hes pushed them this far so he shouldnt throw it all away so easily   the way that this scene brilliantly done isnt concluded leaves an ambiguity that carries on into the final scene when chance and sassy return home but shadow is nowhere to be seen then just as all seems lost he slowly appears and is reunited with the family chances conclusion at the end speaks of the comradeship that has developed between he and his fellows on the journey and the realisation to what home really is from his long journey to get there leaves a fine epilogue to demonstrate how much his character has grown but also how the other two have as well hang on a second i think im going to cry  anyway i havent read sheila burnfords book so i dont pretend to know where the differences between book and film lie but this is a film that all the family can watch and while the tots will love the talking animals older viewers will understand the plot line better as i found when i watched the film again after several years without seeing it this film is a masterpiece in cinema and i suggest that if you havent seen it you go out and get it  and please avoid the sequel see my review for homeward bound ii,positive,1
this movie is entertaining enough due to an excellent performance by virginia madsen and the fact that lindsey haun is lovely however the reason the movie is so predictable is that weve seen it all before ive havent read the book a mothers gift but i hope for britney and lynne spears sake it is completely different than this movie unless you consider ending a movie with what is essentially a music video an original idea the entire movie brings to mind the word plagiarized,negative,0
after i saw this i concluded that it was most likely a chick flick afterward i found out that keiras mother wrote the screenplay so that pretty much confirmed it however a chick flick can have some appeal to men this one does not and really seems not to appeal that well either to women looking at the dismal box office receipts one item that i believe both genders agree upon is the stupidity of the the scene in the movie whereby an analogy is made between the pain of childbirth to the pain of a limb being amputated wo anesthesia though men do not undergo the pain of childbirth we understand that it is a painful process yet it is a natural pain whereas an amputation certainly is not women understand this even better i suspect some woman was trying to make a feminist statement that is in poor taste in fact a lot of things in this movie are in very poor taste though movies nowadays are known for having poor taste this one really excels in that department this could have been a good movie that shows the struggles of dylan thomas during wwii and how strong the sentiment was against men who somehow managed to avoid serving in the military then keiras screen writing mother tries to show how this sentiment was used against dylan but really muddles this instead we get a chick flick about how two young mothers bond together sort of in a way perhaps somehow of note is the fact that a soldier the husband of the friend of dylans wife is sent back home after serving in combat yet it is unclear if the war has ended a lot of things about this movie are similarly unclear and though i have stated that already i will do so again as it seems to be the central motif of this mess,negative,0
this short was nominated for an academy award losing to anna and bella not since doctor strangelove has nuclear war been so hilarious condie takes a situation and turns it on its ear and then gives it a spin for good measure visual gags abound in condies work and i always see something i missed before every time i watch this on the worlds greatest animation well worth seeing for thisand many other shorts recommended,positive,1
i feel at a loss so brilliant is this film kieslowski is a writer a philosopher and while an excellent filmmaker his greatness lies in his writing and red is his paradigm this film is a metafictional study of the artists judgement in the creation of his fictional world of how an artist can attempt to remake life  even his own  thru his art even as he cannot escape the knowledge that no matter how he involves himself in his story it is still fiction and he is still outside of his remade world still burdened with its unreality and the reality of the life he has tried to artistically remake and magically all of this is not to the smallest degree at the expense of a wonderful story about the mysteries of love and fate and the characters who live out this story this prejudged destiny if i had to choose i might nominate this the greatest film ever made,positive,1
big disappointment clash by night is much to talky and stagy and the dialog doesnt resonate as true coming from these characters this is melodrama at its peak the acting is truly over the top and very unreal only marilyn monroe and keith andes as supporting players give this film any zip wish they had more to do im somebody who looks at details in films two big questions1 who is watching the baby the entire day when stanwyck and ryan are together and douglas is working then breaking up a fight in a bar with is father 2 when stanwyck is packing to leave town why is she seen packing at her brothers place where she hasnt lived for at least two years also when everyone goes to the projection room at the theatre whos taking care of the baby again such details really irritate me and cause me to give films much lower ratings what were the writers directors and everyone else connected with the film thinking nuf said,negative,0
a holiday on a boat a married couple an angry waiter and a shipwreck is the reason to this films beginning  i like boobs no question about that but when the main character allies with whoever happens to have the most fish at the moment mostly by having sex with them and playing the role of the constant victim my anger just rises to a whole new level take two guys a husband and another man put a pure bombshell woman in the middle of them ad a deserted island subtract all her moral issues ad a whole bunch of moral issues to the men and mix it in a big bowl of arguments fish and a zippo lighter and you will come up with a piece of junk movie like this   the acting is i would say good there are some bloopers but not many as far as i could see the main female character makes me sick this is due to her lack of moral values the man with the most fish gets her attention even though one of them is her husband she sees no problem with being unfaithful with manuel the other man because i must do it to survive how can you justify having sex with another man for fish when your husband is 30feet away and he wont even benefit from it the female character has absolutely no problems to justify anything that she does if she doesent get approval for her actions shes a victim  i recommend everyone to see this movie this is the kind of movie that will make just about everything else you see this year a pleasant movie experience,negative,0
i really do fail to see the actual surplus value of this movie its not bad enough to be hilarious theres no sleaze or gratuitous nudity although there was plenty of opportunity theres no gore theres no suspense in the first hour of the movie cause theres way to much scenes of tourist having a party and natives playing funky tribal music that last part was actually funny on many occasions you see these natives hitting congas and jembés and thats indeed what you hear badly synchronized on the soundtrack but they also added this funky bassline on the soundtrack so where was the bassplayer at one point the natives get angry and start killing the tourists why all of the sudden its supposed to be because the evil white men build this tourist complex which according to their myth awakened the wrath of the riveralligatorgod i actually missed the explanation for that one but the natives did help for several months to build the tourist complex so why the sudden angriness and how in the hell did they manage to push the helicopter in the water its all silly and pointless this movie also features the skinniest afroamerican model ive ever seen  at one point our heroic leading couple visits this cave where a weird crazy old man lives the only point to that scene is that they make the shocking discovery that the killercrocodile is actually an alligator crocodile or alligator whats the difference its big its made out of plastic and it eats people all the same to me the alligator is a rather silly creation its very stiff  motionless and doesnt even flap its feet when it swims the eyes dont even move when theyre shot in closeup i guess they didnt know animatronics back then in italy during 1979 theres also a lot of pointless intercut shots of the local wildlife i suspect its stock footage  like i said the first hour was pretty lame and the only reason i didnt switch off the movie was because my cat was asleep on my lap and i didnt want to wake the sweet thing but the last half hour of the movie did get better we finally get to see some action when the alligator swims through a horde of panicking people snapping its teeth and munching on them the most entertaining and at the same time funny scene is when alice and daniel drive a van over a bridge and it collapses were looking at a matchboxversion of the van falling in the river here funny but nicely shot in fact there are several other nice traveling cameramoves surprisingly for this type of flick i was gonna point out some stupid details concerning the end of the movie but i dont wanna spoil it completely in case you do decide to watch this movie my advice is to stay away from it if you wanna see a decent alligator movie then see lewis teagues alligator i admit that one isnt italian and isnt a jaws ripoff but it certainly is more fun and if youre interested in other movies made by director sergio martino then i strongly recommend the highly entertaining 2019 after the fall of new york that ones an overthetop ripoff of every possible existing postapocalypticfutureofdoommovie italians and ripoffs two words that go together very well,negative,0
i had seen this movie before but i could not remember it was this fantastic it has a fun plot madonna fumbles around the city with pumas etc causing a commotion and the music is just perfect and the happy ending who´s that girl is a great choice for a romanticist like me in my opinion this could be even the best madonna movie i have ever seen 1010,positive,1
i was so excited to finally watch pulse after receiving it from amazon and i have to say i was utterly disappointed i perhaps think i was too hyped up i had expectations set by its fans that simply couldnt be met after loving other asian horrors i thought i knew this would find a place in my heart  the story was slow painfully so i am a diverse fan of horror i love the brutal bloody craziness of the devils rejects and i love equally the steady growing macabre of a tale of two sisters pulse offered little from either spectrum sadly  along with the sluggishness of the plot it was also very muddled i hadnt a clue why characters were doing what they were doing and how what they were doing would help their problem it seemed as if the director spouted off the plot in a sentence or two and the rest was improf from our actors unlike a tale of two sisters which also has a rather hardtofollow plot line pulse clears up very little at the end and left me feeling frustrated confused and uninterested in the characters endeavors my closing statement about the plot was its inconsistency at first it seemed as if the story was about the ghost world overflowing and their medium of escaping is the internet thats a damn original idea i like that but as the plot drones on plotholes and unexplained happenings rearing their heads in it seems the director switched to some apocalyptic tale as evident by the ending that just hasnt been clear enough throughout to execute  i realize the dreariness of the shots and the setting was intentional to make the viewer feel bleak and isolated but the dullness of the movie was only intensified by the grainy shadowy surroundings i will admit there was a certain feel of surrealism with the movie but that may have just been my attention waning in and out  the actions of some of the characters are a little bit ridiculous as well and perhaps if i was more enthralled by the story i wouldve been able to suspend more disbelief but as well myself being unmotivated so too were some of the characters like i mentioned previously the logic behind what certain characters did were absent and contributed to the incoherence of the plot perhaps it was a result of the plots incoherence that the characters do questionable things to be honest i dont really care  the acting was decent certainly nothing outstanding but nothing terrible either no outliers to mention on either side of brilliant or plain awful  now ill stop sounding so sour and mention that there were a handful of creepy moments one towards the end especially that if there were more like it throughout i wouldve enjoyed this movie almost wholly i thought whenever the website was shown it was pretty unsettling as well as some of the ghostly encounters our two main characters face the things that went on between these ghastly runins were just too lackluster baffling and wtf for me to truly appreciate  now for something pertaining to the dvd itself magnolias release of pulse comes with subtitles yes but the subtitles are off they arent said at the correct time of the characters speech it may sound nitpicking but it bothered me a little and it may bother some others i think this is the only north american release of the film though so you either have to deal or watch dubbing never watch dubbing i tried to like the film i really did i wanted this film to live up to the hype but sadly it fell flat for me if youre looking for other creepy asian cinema i can recommend you audition shutter a tale of two sisters strange circus and marebito  all of which are more my palette,negative,0
eric rohmers the lady and the duke is based on the journals of an english aristocrat who lived through the french revolution but its a stilted affair with its strange painted backdrops and mannered conversational tone most notably this portrait of age of terror takes place almost entirely at one remove from the real action one sees very little of ordinary people in this movie and little of the chaos poverty and terror that unfolded away from the drawing rooms of the persecuted but spoilt aristocratic classes the result is frequently dull and ultimately unenlightening about the forces that sometimes drive societies to the brink of destruction its a disappointing film from an acclaimed director,negative,0

a hit at the time but now better categorised as an australian cult film the humour is broad unsubtle and in the final scene where a bbc studio fire is extinguished by urinating on it crude contains just about every cliche about the traditional australian pilgrimage to the old country and every cliche about those rapacious stuck up whinging tory brits would be acceptable to the british because of its strong cast of well known actors and to australians of that generation who can get the humour americans  forget it the language and jokes are in the australian dialect of english and as such will be unintelligible,positive,1
originally a response to a movie reviewer who said a bugs life was too much too fasthe was dazed and exhausted by the visuals and seemed to ignore the story completely  okay first off im 26 years old have a job go to school and have a fiance so maybe im nuts and just really good at hiding itbut not only did i not come away from a bugs life exhausted or dazed it wasnt until i saw it the second time that i could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visualsbecause the first time i went to see this movie i got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that i forgot that i was supposed to be sitting there being wowed by each frame visually how can you not empathize with flik and his roadtoheckpavedwithgoodintentions life heck indeed i found myself identifying with that little ant not to mention some of the other bugs in a lot more ways than oneand that in itself says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy of course its beautiful every blade of grass the tree the rain of course what they can do with technology is amazing you can read their lips try it but this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color no a bugs life would be static if it were all that and no story but im glad to say its not a bugs life has real heart yes theres a lot going on storylinewise as well as visually but thats because the story and characters actually have some depth to them just because its a kids movie doesnt mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre doorkids are smarter than you think besides that i think that the pixar crew made this for themselves even before their kidsand it shows in the amount of heart in has this movie is moving touching funny intriguing and generally engrossing the character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing theres a major amount of character growth and not just of the main characterso rare in animation and often in movies in general it doesnt hit you over the head with its points once its made themevery scene every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there and there are no gratuitous shots not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety to me folks it means not dumbing down your movie and assuming the audience is stupid which it mostly is not all i can think is if you can see a bugs life and not feel anything at all then you must have never made a big mistake hurt your friends had a crush fallen in love been frustrated that no one would listen to you lied to someone you care about felt like a social misfit gotten excited over a new idea come up with a great idea had what you thought was a great idea backfire been awkward one moment and confident the next felt the pressure of responsibility stood up for yourself and your loved ones stood alone against the crowd felt like a failure felt like a big success felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of otherswell you get the point final words a rating from me please if youre going to see it try to see it in the theatre pan and scan video is not going to work for this movie if you loved toy story youll most likely love this pixar knows how to make movies with heart if you do love it see it multiple times or you still wont know what youre missing the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable and whenever youre feeling really low just pretend its a seed okay,positive,1
had ned kelly been born later he probably would have won a victoria cross at gallipolli such was neds bravery  in australia and especially country victoria the name ned kelly can be said and immediately recognised in greta he is still a hero the life blood of the town of jerilderie depends on the tourism he created but in mansfield they still havent forgotten that the three policeman that he murdered were from there  many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing from the old melbourne gaol where he was hanged to the post office he held up in jerilderie a cell he was once held in in greta is on display in benella and the site of ann jones hotel the station and even the logs where he was captured in glenrowan can be visited  evidence of all the events in the movie except for his love interest can be found all over victoria in police records and even in the sash that ned was awarded with for rescuing dick shelton from drowning none of this is wrong and whats left out would further justify neds actions the horse that ned stole was actually stolen by wild wright the man who ned boxes with after getting out of jail ned was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen so he couldnt have stolen it  the jerilderie letter is more than what has been stated before it is not self justification it is neds biography an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting so go ahead and read it watch the movie and then make up your mind about what ned stood for,positive,1

there are two ways to regard head either it is a dazzling mindblowing collage of music old film clips psychedelia and tv sitcomstyle comedy or a plot less pretentious rambling mess the truth probably lies somewhere in between it is also one of the best movies of all time  the monkees  davy jones peter tork mickey dolenz and mike nesmith  had just finished their hit series and wanted to do a movie in collaboration with writer jack nicholson and director bob rafelson they made head  it begins at a bridge opening ceremony in san francisco where the monkees gate crash the proceedings mickey jumps over the safety rail plunging hundreds of feet into the water mermaids rescue him to the accompaniment of a gorgeous jerry goffin  carole king composition called the porpoise song and visuals that make the stargate finale of 2001 look drab by comparison by now you will either have switched off in puzzled disgust or be completely captivated  more bizarre happenings unfold mickey uses a tank to destroy a cocacola machine in the middle of the desert the entire italian army surrenders to him the group are hired to play to play the dandruff in victor matures hair for a television commercial an overweight waitress insults the group describing them as gods gift to the eight year olds a surprise birthday party for mike goes wrong the group are sucked into a vacuum cleaner and to cap it all are driven away inside a giant glass tank  you will either hate this or love it i found it a refreshing change from mindless pop musicals of the lets do the show right here variety the songs are good too daddys song is superbly choreographed by toni basil  later to appear in rafelsons easy rider  and boasts wonderful editing with davys clothes changing colour at lightning speed as we go along is a lovely goffin  king number whose accompanying images carry a strong environmentalist message  frank zappa annette funicello are just two of the guest stars to crop up did victor mature read the script before agreeing to do this one wonders hes hilarious in it though  so mad there just has to be real genius behind it head is a little 60s gem and one worth revisiting time and time again shame it did not find an audience at the time if only spiceworld had been like this,positive,1
help ive ended up in cinema hell what a completely stupid film this is really nothing is good about it   lets spit it out  1 the story is incredibly farfetched an antieu terrorist group is chasing a bunch of guys who drive around western europe carrying a delivery of seethrough bags full of xtc pills and the worst thing is they are serious about it  2 the level of acting should put great shame on all faces involved   3 some moneyeyed guy decided to let every one talk english so that the international market would catch on ugliest advertising ever the french and dutch native tongues talking smart make all but sense and the result is laughable   4 the soundtrack is totally misplaced and illchosen  5 the camera edit and effects work is supposed to be of some post noir road movie kind of style but is hardly worth some thing and not meant to accompany this story read anti story  6 hidde maas the hero of wildschut never fails to convince a true actor usually i would give an extra point just for the sake of him being around but no sorry not this time i would just not forgive my self,negative,0

this movie should go down as one of the funniest movies in history its cousins a mighty wind spinal tap and waiting for guffman are terrific in their own right but best in show takes the cake   a movie about the idiosyncrasies of dog owners that show their dogs competitively its the intricacies of the characters that make it so good after watching the movie about 75 times i have come to the conclusion that there is no weak character or actor in this film there is very little interaction between any of the groups of characters but that only seems to add to the beauty of the film   if you watch this movie and dont find it as funny as i am billing it as watch it again the first time i saw it i thought it was serviceable but not overly hilarious it is a film that grows on you defininatly a movie that you will find yourself quoting frequently   characters hamilton and meg swan a if you get the dvd check out how these characters were born amazing that these two could hit it so on the head and to find out that they really didnt go by a script and sort of made it up as they went   gerry and cookie guggleman a cookie is especially funny and she does a fantastic job of selling the cookie character gerry eugene levy delivers his standard stellar performance of the hilarious discombobulated type weaker half   stefan vanderhoof and scott donalan a find me a funnier character than scott donalan i dare you he will forever be typecast as this character to me as he was so natural and didnt seem forced at any point stefan micheal mckean was very good as well and they interplay here and a brief appearance with the gugglemans goes to show why he is always in these films a great actor with razor like wit   harlan pepper b i dont want it to seem like he isnt funny he sure is but being the only solo act he cant be quite as funny as the others above he does use the dog more than others and has some other idiosyncrasies going for him  the rest are all great as well there is no weak character see this film at least twice buy it you will not regret it,positive,1
many have disparaged never say never again because it is not an official bond movie nevertheless it is manifest that the producers adhered to the fruitful bond formula although the film does not have a precredit sequence it is clear that the training exercise at the commencement of the film is meant to be the introductory scene it would have been impossible for eon to stop the producers from including a precredit and title sequence albeit without the gunbarrel introduction  sean connery is on fine form as the immortal secret agent and this film is certainly better than dr no thunderball you only live twice and diamonds are forever although nsna is meant to be a remake of thunderball it is a vast improvement 007 spends more time on terra firma and a more diverse range of exotic locations are included in the film   there is some resplendent acting in this movie barbara carrera is impeccable as the bizarre fatima blush one of the best scenes in the film is the coup de grace between bond and fatima in nice which is preceded by a dynamic motorcycle chase through the city klaus maria brandauer plays the psychotic largo and max von sydow is free of the melodrama that other actors portraying blofeld have indulged in  nsna tends to centre on connery rather than the character of bond at the commencement it is stated that bond is ageing and has been out of action this seems to refer to the 12 year hiatus in connerys portrayal of bond bond promises never again to work in the secret service an allusion to connerys portrayal of bond it appears that the producers were trying to hurt the official bond franchise   nevertheless this film is definitely worth watching this is the last time that sean connery played james bond but his performance convinced me that perhaps he should have never have said never again,positive,1
we really enjoyed grey owl a simple tale well told in classic attenborough fashion a little overromanticized with archetypes humor and a stress of dignity and values  beautifully shot and told at a nice pace this is the true story of archie an englishman who turned native indian and went to live and trap in canada  solid performances from all makes this film with a message easy viewing  two of the stars of the film are without a doubt the cutest we have ever seen  and the message is a good one with its ecoleanings it must have been great to meet or read grey owl in the 1930s a unique character and this is a fitting film tribute,positive,1
i rented the dvd in a video store as an alternative to reading the report but its pretty much just more terrortainment  while the film may present some info from the report in the drama youre taking the word of the producers  theres no reference to the commission report anywhere in the film not one  the acting all around is pretty bad  pretty much all of the stereotypes of hot shot bitchy foul mouthed government agents each thinking they know more than everyone else there may be some truth to it but it really has a bad hollywood stereotype smell to it  imdbs user community ratings  comments tend to be more right than wrong and i have started to glance at the ratings before renting whenever i can  i wish i had on this one,negative,0
at the height of the celebrity big brother racism row in 2007  involving shilpa shetty and the late jade goody  i condemned on an internet forum those cbb fans who praised the show after years of bashing racist 70s sitcoms such as curry  chips  love thy neighbour i thought they were being hypocritical and said so it aint half hot mum was then thrown into the argument with some pointing out it had starred an english actor blackedup well yes but michael bates had lived in india as a boy and spoke urdu fluently the shows detractors overlook the reality he brought to his performance as bearer rangi ram the noted indian character actor renu setna said in a 1995 documentary perry  croft the sitcoms that he was upset when he heard bates had landed the role but added no indian actor could have played that role as well as bates indeed  mum was perry and crofts companion show to dads army also set in wartime the sedate english town of walmingtononsea had been replaced by the hot steamy jungles of india in particularly a place called deolali where an army concert party puts on shows for the troops among them bombadier solomons  george layton his first sitcom role since doctor in charge  camp gunner gloria beaumont  melvyn hayes  diminutive gunner lofty sugden lah dedah gunner graham  john clegg  and gunner parkins  the late christopher mitchell  presiding over this gang of misfits was the bellicose sergeantmajor williams  the brilliant windsor davies  who regarded them all as poofs his frustration at not being able to lead his men up the jungle to engage the enemy in combat made him bitter and bullying  though he was nice to parkins whom he thought was his illegitimate son  then there was everso english colonel reynolds  donald hewlett  and dimwitted captain ashwood  michael knowles  rangi was like a wise old sage beginning each show by talking to the camera and closing them by quoting obscure hindu proverbs he loved being bearer so much he came to regard himself as practically british his friends were the teamaking char wallah  the late dino shafeek who went on to mind your language  and the rope pulling punka wallah  babar bhatti  so real indians featured in the show  another point its detractors ignore shafeek also provided what was described on the credits as vocal interruptions  similar to the 40s songs used as incidental music on dads army  each edition closed with him warbling land of hope  glory only to be silenced by a shut up from williams the excellent opening theme was penned by jimmy perry and derek taverner  though never quite equalling dads army in the publics affections mum nevertheless was popular enough to run for a total of eight seasons in 1975 davies and estelle topped the charts with a cover version of that old chestnut whispering grass they then recorded an entire album of old chestnuts entitled  what else  sing lofty  the show hit crisis point three years later when bates died of cancer rather than recast the role of rangi the writers just let him be quietly forgotten when george layton left the character of gloria took his place as bombadier providing another source of comedy  the last edition in 1981 saw the soldiers leave india by boat for blighty the char wallah watching them go with great sadness  as did viewers   repeats have been few and far between  mainly on uk gold  all because of its socalled dodgy reputation this is strange for one thing the show was not specifically about racism if a white man blackedup is so wrong why does david leans 1984 film a passage to india still get shown on television  it featured alec guinness as an indian and won two oscars  it was derived from jimmy perrys own experiences some characters were based on real people  the sergeantmajor really did refer to his men as poofs  i take the view that if you are going to put history on television get it right sanitizing the past no matter how unsavoury it might seem to modern audiences is fundamentally dishonest mum was both funny and truthful and viewers saw this thank heavens for dvds i say time to stop this review as williams would say ill have no gossiping in this jungle,positive,1

really bad movie the story is too simple and predictable and poor acting as a complement  this vampires hunter story is the worst that i have seen so far derek bliss jon bon jovi travels to mexico in search for some blood suckers he use some interesting weapons but nothing compared to blade and is part of some van helsig vampires hunters net ok but he work alone hes assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen that is searching some black crucifix to perform a ritual which will enable her to be invulnerable to sunlight is almost a sequel of vampires 1998 directed by john carpenter and starred by james woods derek start his quest in the search of the queen with some new friends sancho diego luna really bad acting also a teenager without experience father rodrigo cristian de la fuente a catholic priest zoey natasha wagner a particular vampire and ray collins darius mccrary another expert vampire hunter so obviously in this adventure he isnt alone  you can start feeling how this movie would be just looking at his lead actor jon bon jovi is a huge difference in the acting quality compared to james woods and then if you watch the film i dont recommend this part you will get involved in one of the more simplest stories totally predictable with terrible acting performances really bad special effects and incoherent events  i deeply recommend not to see this film rent another movie see another channel go out with your friends etc  310,negative,0
flynn known mostly for his swashbuckling roles and his bedroom antics takes a different tack with this film and it works beautifully playing reallife boxing champ jim corbett flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled san francisco bank teller to a celebrated pugilist all the while setting one eye on society deb smith he and best pal carson attend an illegal bareknuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men and a dog including a prominent judge the next day he gets a chance via smith to gain entrance to the judges private club he uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land a spot as the clubs resident boxer his unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers up to and including the world champion john l sullivan bond flynn is downright magical here he is the epitome of charm charisma and appeal in this role he looks terrific especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing a white union suit and does virtually all of his own stuntwork impressively his line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for flynn at this stage he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time and she does so admirably she is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell bond is incredibly burly brawny and towering yet tender when the script calls for it amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient carson frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as flynns manager the rest of the cast is excellent as well including flynns rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy nob hill types the whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed a few of the sets are amazingly presented some of smiths gowns border on the garish but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well its a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing but its also so much more some of it like the character traits shown by flynn is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purposes but a lot of it is authentic like the methods and costumes shown in the fight scenes one line is particularly memorable i believe you like me more than i like you but its entirely possible that i love you more than you love me its classic romantic dialogue and there are more than a few zingers sprinkled throughout the script as well,positive,1

well it definitely is unlike anything else directed by lynch no supernatural stuff no violence no profanity nevertheless it is a beautiful flick its a little slow but perhaps that was intentional because its the story of an old mans 6weekthats my best guess for its duration journey the characters are everyday people and thus they are believable the performances are good and the final scene was incredibly touching everyone who has a sibling can relate to it lyle and alvin dont even have to say anything for a moment they are back in the old days and all the fighting is forgotten,positive,1

blood of the sacred blood of the damned is the third installment of the gabriel knight games a series of adventure games about the roguish writerparanormal detective gabriel knight gabriel and his companion grace have been asked by prince james of albany to investigate a series of mysterious attacks by socalled night visitors when the son of prince james is kidnapped gabriel pursues the night visitors to rennes le château where he begins piecing together a mystery relating to the holy grail  despite the marketing this game is not about vampires vampires have a token appearance in the game but never command center stage as did the voodoo hounfor in sins of the fathers or the werewolves in the beast within gabriel and grace make no attempt to uncover the true nature of vampires or to research lore on vampires although the vampires do murder three people during the course of the game their victims are chosen at random and have nothing to do with the main plot  a large part of the charm of the first two gabriel knight installments was in the relationships which gabriel formed with the villains through these relationships the player could not help but sympathize with the villain and thus the villain was transformed into more of a human and less of a monster however in blood of the sacred gabriels only interaction with the villain is through a single cheesy interview which does nothing to endear the villain to the player  the roles that gabriel and grace play in this mystery are fairly futile gabriel spends his time snooping into the identities of members of a treasurehunter tour group staying at his hotel but what he uncovers amounts to nothing more than a red herring grace spends her time researching the mystery of rennes le château but all her research is rendered superfluous by the presence of a perplexing ally who has known the answer to this mystery for centuries  the actions of this perplexing ally and his polar opposite  the vampire leader  are insupportable the ally leaves hints about the mystery of rennes le château in broad daylight and expects grace and not the other treasure hunters from the tour group to find them however he could have revealed the mystery to grace in its entirety on day 1 instead of putting the kidnapped child at risk for an additional 48 hours and in the end he simply tells grace the mystery in its entirety anyway  meanwhile the vampire leader fails to achieve the goals of centuries of scheming because he chooses to refrain from action for two days after the kidnapping of the child the only reason given for his decision to delay action is that he wants to savor his victory  the game would have been much better had it been purely focused on the holy grail the kidnapping and vampires should have been omitted replaced with a race against the vatican to uncover the mystery of rennes le château since gabriel is portrayed more than once as reluctantly catholic this conflict would have had many opportunities for character development  all in all the game was a disappointing installment in the series despite an improved interface and the return of tim curry as the voice of gabriel knight,negative,0
having watched this film years ago it never faded from my memory i always thought this was the finest performance by michelle pfeiffer that ive seen but i am astounded by the number of negative reviews that this film has received after seeing it once more today i still think it is powerful moving and couldnt care less if it is based loosely on king lear  i now realize that this is the greatest performance by jessica lange that ive ever seen  and she has had accolades for much shallower efforts  a thousand acres is complex human vibrant and immensely moving but surely doesnt present either of the primary female leads with any touch of glamour or sexiness i dont think this is well received in these times  perhaps one reason for this films underwhelming response lies in the fact that the writer jane smiley screenplay laura jones and director jocelhyn moorehouse are all women i know that in my younger days i wouldnt have read a book written by a woman i didnt focus on this fact until years later  if you havent seen this movie or gave it a chance in the past try watching it anew maybe you are ready for it,positive,1
a tedious yawn of a film that retains nothing of the zing and raciness of its predecessor gold diggers of 1933 the production code was firmly in place by the time of this films release so the humour is all of the hokey wockawocka variety and gone are the dry oneliners that sounded so cosmopolitan dripping off the lips of the gorgeous dames from the first film a cast of secondtier stars and character actors go through the motions here and the puttin on a show motif seems awfully forced instead of the make or break world of broadway the show here is a charity event hosted by a swanky hotel who really cares whether or not the show goes on the score here is bland too of course the movies big number is lullaby of broadway which accompanies a long fantasy dance number about a new york socialites eventual demise from too much partyingdoesnt exactly have the same effect as the searing forgotten man number used as the finale in 33 busby berkeley directs as well as choreographs this film and whatever promise is built up in the films fluid opening scenes quickly deteriorates unfortunately no one learned any lessons from this and there was yet another gold diggers movie two years later  grade c,negative,0
i saw this film last night on cable and it is extraordinary what i love most about it is that it is understated and lowkey but deeply heartfelt henry thomas he played the child in et performance is masterfully inarticulate he is supposed to be a man of few words david straithern is a wonderful crazy villain and miraculously given that were talking about a hollywood product here a baby serves as a main character but one who doesnt act or have lines but rather just is  is luminous at that interesting to note that thomas mysterious relationship w et was the core of that film while his bond w the baby serves as the core of a good baby  then there is the musicah what music gillian welchs tunes are wonderful  the entire score is gorgeous hill country music  this film is wonderfully atmospheric i recommend it highly,positive,1

well as a life long fan of kung fu films i have to say this is one of the best i have ever seen sure there is nothing special about the plot but man does it entertain as does most movies of the genre this film is packed with action and does not boar its viewers its so damn fun when i watch i have a smile on my face the whole time this also has an impact on future films like kill bill many of kill bills sound effects come from this film for example this is essential viewing for all knew viewers in kung fu form open to close this film is filled with fights that really are some of the better i have seen in the genre there are few kung fu films out there that measure up to the sheer magic and entertainment of this film so if in search of a great kung fu movie check this one out for sure,positive,1
seeing all of the negative reviews for this movie i figured that it could be yet another comic masterpiece that wasnt quite meant to be i watched the first two fight scenes listening to the generic dialogue delivered awfully by lungren and all of the other thrownin oriental actors and i found the movie so awful that it was funny then brandon lee enters the story and the oneliners start flying the plot falls apart the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out its welcome as it turns into the worst action movie ever  lungren beats out his previous efforts in the punisher and others as well as all of van dammes movies seagals movies and stallones nonrocky movies for this distinct honor this movie has the absolute worst acting check out tia carreres face when she is in any scene with dolph thats worth a laugh with the worst dialogue ever brandon lees comment about little dolph is the worst line ever in a film and the worst outfit in a film dolph in full japanese attire picture tango and cash with worse acting meets commando meets friday the 13th because of the senseless nudity and lungrens performance is very jason voorheeslike in an hour and fifteen minute joke of a movie  the good how about not awful performances go to the bad guy who still looks constipated through his entire performance and carrere who somehow says her 5 lines without breaking out laughing brandon lee is just there being lungrens sidekick and doing a really awful job at that  an awful awful movie fear it and avoid it if you do watch it though ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most nonunderwater shots speaking of the underwater shots check out the lame water fight scene with the worst fightsceneending ever this movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those with short attention spans and to fillin between the flashes of nudity  a bad bad movie,negative,0
i dont understand the exaggerated good critics about this film except that a lot of people from venezuela are understandably very excited based on that the venezuelan cinema is really a bit behind of what other countries are in the region  the movie first of all is too repetitive a lot of scenes are almost identical from each of the both leading roles so you get the impression that its a time filler a time filler is also a good point as this movie is definitely too long with 105 minutes you will start to get tired after a while and watch on the clock  all actors are quite bad by exception of the venezuelan guy edgar ramirez who brings in a bit of slapstick and plays the role of the venezuelan recruit pedro  by the way this is not a representative movie about the people of the region caribean zone it tends to ridicules them,negative,0

the final installment sees sho aikawa and riki takeuchi looking cooler than ever in his reversible overcoat pitched against each other for one last battle this time in the future the plot owes a lot to blade runner but done in takashi miikes low budget frenetic comic style i did feel that it was the weakest of the three doa films and although the ending was still outrageous it lacked the shock value of the previous two compared to the likes of ichi the killer and visitor q doafinal is nowhere near as extreme but is faithful to the other two films in the trilogy that said fans of the first two and fans of miike will get a lot from this as it ties all three films together and gives a final explanation of the relationship between the two protagonists,positive,1

its a shame this movie didnt get more play in theatres its a rich textured love story with believable alltoohuman characters who are too busy gaming and protecting their hearts to recognize the real thing when they experience it one of the most pleasurable aspects of this movie is its setting in chicago among hip artistic literate middleclass africanamericans who discuss poetry music and literature another is his royal fineness larenz tate  and if you are even half a fan of his you need to see this film his boyish cockiness and vulnerability are perfect for the role of darius nia long also shines as nina who longs to tell darius she loves him but is afraid the break the rules a great movie to watch curled up on the couch with your sweetie,positive,1
this production never really got off the ground for me the plot is so cut up as to be disjointed and the production is so short that unless youve read the novel or seen a better adaptation like the 1995 one with amanda root youre going to be a bit lost since theres no time for character development  i liked sally hawkins as anne but the rest of the cast fell rather short of what they should have been mrs croft was far too old as was annes elder sister elizabeth mary uttered everything in such throbbing accents that the general peevishness and selfishness of her character was lost much better was sophie thompsons mary whose selfishness and sense of illusage is so well established that by the time wentworth suggests anne stay with the injured louisa and mary objects that she as louisas sister in law should stay instead you cant imagine anyone less suited to do so in this version she might as well stay as she is insufficiently differentiated from anyone else in the production  rupert penryjones is nice to look at but he made a much better st john rivers 1995 jane eyre probably because that character required less implied depth of feeling i agree with the comments made earlier about the gig scene seemed more like he was trying to get rid of anne than do her a favor likewise the accident scene it happens so fast and with so little context you wonder what all the fuss is about and moving the speech that wentworth overhears in the novel to the beginning of this production is a critical misstep that only contributes to the disjointed nature of the script   my other problem with this version was the lighting sometimes everything looked like a scene from the csi morgue  very very blue other times the lighting was so bad it was hard to make out the scene very well like when anne visits her old school friend mrs smith who by the way is supposed to be more or less paralyzed having her run up to anne on the street to tell her of mr elliots awful character was such a violation that for a minute i couldnt think who she was  i thought she was one of the musgrove girls and she might as well have been all the girls were pretty much interchangeable and the running scene at the endin an era where propriety was at a premium its hard to imagine gentle anne tearing all over bath like some demented hoyden how silly can you get its too bad sally hawkins had all the makings of a good anne elliot but she was completely hamstrung by a poorly organized script and an overtruncated production,negative,0

who knew dowdy queen victoria the plump monarch who was a virtual recluse for 40 years after the death of her husband prince albert actually led a life fraught with drama and intrigue in her younger days the young victoria not only chronicles the young queens romance with her husbandtobe but also does a pretty good job of detailing the political machinations surrounding her ascent to the throne  the act i setup draws you in right away following the death of victorias father the duke of kent in 1820 less than a year after victorias birth the duchess of kent eventually hooked up with former army officer john conroy who offered his services as comptroller to the widow and her infant queentobe conroy insisted that victoria be raised under the atrocious kensington system rules designed to prevent the future queen from having any contact with other children while growing up whats more victoria was forced to sleep in her mothers bedroom everyday until she became queen  the film explains that in 1830 parliament passed the regency act which established that victorias mother would become regent and hence guardian in the event that victoria acceded to the throne while still a minor during this time the duchess and conroy tried to intimidate the hapless princess and insisted that she sign papers making conroy her private secretary and treasurer strongwilled victoria would have none of it and refused to go along with conroys and her mothers nefarious plans the duchess disliked king william as she regarded him as a philanderer who brought disrespect to the monarchy the king felt the duchess disrespected his wife as a result the duchess attempted to limit victorias contact with the king in an overthetop scene which seemed to actually have occurred in history the king berated the duchess at his birthday banquet stating that it was his goal to survive until victoria reached her 18th birthday so that her mother would not become regent  king william kept his word and died a short time after victoria became eligible to accede to the throne victoria took revenge on her mother for her support of conroy whom she blamed for making her childhood so miserable they were both banished to a secluded apartment in buckingham palace and for a number of years victoria had little contact with her mother  the young victoria conveys the excitement and pomp and circumstance surrounding victorias coronation as queen a good part of the film deals with victorias relationship with lord melbourne the whig party prime minister who unfortunately is depicted in the film as much younger than he actually was in the beginning melbourne gains the young queens trust and they become good friends in the early years of her reign she sees melbourne as a progressive but later loses respect for him somewhat as hes revealed to be a typical politician hiding his contempt for the masses whom hes supposed to be championing in reality melbourne was more a father figure to victoria but the film hints at some sexual tension between the prime minister and prince albert as though they were romantic rivals  the plot thickens when melbourne is forced out and the queen must commission sir robert peel of the more conservative tory party as the new prime minister the film chronicles the events of the bedchamber crisis in which peel resigned after victoria refused to replace some of her bedchamber ladies with the wives of tory politicians the film leaves out another scandal which involved a lady hastings one of the duchesss ladiesinwaiting who was accused of having an affair with john conroy and becoming pregnant by him because of her hatred for conroy victoria contributed to the nasty rumors being spread about hastings alleged pregnancy as it turned out hastings only appeared pregnantwhat she actually had was an abdominal tumor victorias inexperience shows during the bedchamber crisis but the films scenarists ignore some of the more unsavory aspects of her character as evidenced by the hastings affair  the rest of the the young victoria deals with  of course  the romance between the queen and prince albert victoria kept albert waiting as the film makes clear since she wanted to acclimate herself to her duties as the new sovereign they spent a good deal of time corresponding with one another until albert returned to england and gave victoria support during the trying times of the bedchamber crisis  i find a good number of parallels between prince albert and prince philip the current queens husband while philip is mainly danish he went to school in germany and had inlaws who were of german background both albert and philip made it their business to reform etiquette in the court theres a great scene where albert discovers that the servants are still setting a table for king george iii even though he had been dead for years alberts struggle was the same for philipas husbands of monarchs they had to find something to do both albert and philip became involved in various civic projects and proved that they didnt have to live continually in the shadow of their everpopular wives  fortunately theres an excellent scene toward the end of the film where albert infuriates victoria with what she perceives as his interference in her affairs albert doesnt want a second bedchamber crisis so he goes over his wifes head and arranges a compromise involving victorias bedchamber ladies victoria is barely talking to albert when an assassins bullets almost cuts them both down in the film albert is shot in the arm but this never happened  the performances in the film are uniformly excellent especially the principals emily blunt and rupert friend the young victoria ends rather abruptly and the closing credits lean too much toward hagiography no mention of victorias depression after alberts death but victoria is still an engaging drama and fascinating history lesson,positive,1
where do i begin its one of the most frustrating movies ive seen because it makes a lot of sense in terms of the point but it comes off as seriously stupid a movie about a ghost inhabited bed the first 2 minutes of the movie shows a black and white flashback of a weird looking fat dude going dominatrix on a fabienne from pulp fiction lookalike contest winner and strangles her with his tie this is supposed to set up how the bed factors into the story still though if you wanted an opening to keep people interested or send them away early having a strangulation is the way to do it fast forward to the present day a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and begins unpacking their things so far everythings normal then one night while doing the hippity dippity on a single mattress they realize they need a bed frame this is where things get fishy why didnt they bring or buy a gd damn bed frame before they got there we learn that the door leading to the attic where the first 2 minutes took place doesnt open but then once the couple realizes they need a bed frame the door magically opens they go up to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it downstairs and their lovemaking days are savedor so they thought the rest of the movie centers around the both of them being haunted by the bedframe the female is an artist so she starts drawing up the ghoulish images she dreams about and the male is a photographer so he starts having his models act as if theyre bring tortured or tied upone of which has gray hair and appears over 50 years old yuck the female grows increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a haven for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie they find the friendly landlord murdered which makes no sense since ghosts need to take a human form to kill and decide to get the hell out of dodge while packing up the husband moronically goes up into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy fat dude and the female bashes his skull in before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills some dude trying to hit on her  well if youve read this far you have to be thinking one thingwhy the hell didnt they just throw the bedframe out the window seriously they never said anything about the actual house being haunted just the bedso why not get rid of the damn thing and move on thats why the movie is so frustrating because it actually is a good plot and the actors follow suit accordingly but there are more holes in it than sonny corleone at a toll booth the couple did try to leave town as upposed to every other movie that has the ol oh lets give this place a chance honey scheme going so props to that still though me and my buddy who watched the movie kept saying every 5 minuteswhy didnt they just throw the bed out especially once they learned it was haunted would have been a good time to set it on fire or something  all in all its a nearwatchable movie with plenty of porno like bed scenes and a believable plot to an extent but the solution is so simple youre scratching your head by the end of the movie wondering how stupid can the married couple be the highlight of the movie is when the husband tells the 50 year old model to spread her legs and his assistant tells him that he cant shoot her like that  4 out of 10 a low budget porno the man show would love,negative,0
for those of you still in the dark i will not spoil this christie as it is definitely one of her finest works and i stress that you should see it whenever you next have free time if any of the adaptations are to be watched before or in lieu of reading the book i would suggest after the funeral for the following reasons  i wanted to praise the performance by monica dolan miss gilchrist whose employercompanion cora is brutally murdered at the outset of the film her portrayal of a shocked nervous insignificant woman is actually moving especially when she has a moment of personal connection with poirot another person who travels alone in the journey of life and when the murderer is being revealed in typical poirot denouement fashion dolans reactions to the revelation are acting at its finest you feel as angry at the murderer as you do sympathetic to miss gilchrist something uncommon in christie lore  although there are a couple of discrepancies between novel and film adaptation as per usual the business of the will perhaps making less sense in the film the unbelievably lavish recreation of postwar england thoroughly high calibre of acting and directing and preservation if not heightening of christies mystery and intrigue render these discrepancies insignificant  bravo suchet dolan and the whole team for crafting this masterpiece of murder mystery theatre and the producers who gave it the green light encore,positive,1
some films that you pick up for a pound turn out to be rather good  23rd century films released dozens of obscure italian and american movie that were great but although hardgore released some fulci films amongst others the bulk of their output is crap like the zombie chronicles  the only positive thing i can say about this film is that its nowhere near as annoying as the stink of flesh other than that its a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a lego house built by a whelk  its been noted elsewhere but you really do have to worry about a film that inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence so by the time it gets to the zombie attacks youve seen it all already  bad movie fans will have a ball watching the 18000 continuity mistakes and the diabolical acting of the cast especially the hitchhiker who was so bad he did make me laugh a bit and kudos to hardgore for getting in to the spirit of things by releasing a print so bad it felt like i was watching some beat up home video of a camping trip  awful awful stuff weve all made stuff like this when weve gotten a hold of a camera but common sense prevails and these films languish in our cupboards somewhere avoid,negative,0
this is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue what dialogue there is appears in word baloons as it would in the manga the plot of this is existent but only vaguely accounted for there is an issue of the manga on which this is based available in english in the blast books collection comics underground japan and it has actual captioned dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here i recommend checking that volume out if you liked this as it explains some of the plot of the movie which is otherwise inexplicable animation wise this is pretty decent good unintrusive use of computers and the images are for the most part realized well it jumps in and out of episodes as the characters a cat and his braindead older sister cat wander in and out of a series of odd images a boat a circus a desert for a mere half hour they go through a number of semiplots and settings which leads me to believe that the director chose a number of issues of the longrunning manga to adapt at random but primarilly selected visually knowing whats going on might somewhat increase appreciation this reminds me mostly of the kind of stuff they used to play on the mtv show cartoon sushi in particular a short that features a cat chasing a mans severed buttcheek around the house only in this case the cats resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes though not all that easy to tell whats going on the dvd of this has directors commentary and a making of features but i cant comment on those because i didnt get around to them im giving this a 810 for now here isnt much to compare it to in anime and i hope for more like this,positive,1
as a child i preferred the first care bear movie since this one seemed so dark i always sat down and watched the first one as i got older i learned to prefer this one what i do think is that this film is too dark for infants but as you get older you learn to treasure it since you understand it more it doesnt seem as dark as it was back when you were a child  this movie in my opinion is better than the first one everything is so much deeper it may contradict the first movie but you must ignore the first movie to watch this one the cubs are just too adorable i rewind that flying my colors scene i tend to annoy everyone by singing it  the sound track is great a big hand to carol and dean parks i love every song in this movie i have downloaded them all and is all i am listening to im listening to our beginning also known as recalling at the moment i have always preferred this sound track to the first one although i just totally love carol kings song in the first movie carealot  i think the animation is great the animation in both movies are fantastic i was surprised when i sat down and watched it about 10 years later and saw that the animation for the time was excellent it was really surprising  there is not a lot of back up from other people to say that this movie is great but it is i do not think it is weirdstrange i think it is a wonderful movie  basically this movie is about how the care bears came about and to defeat the demon dark heart the end is surprising and again beats any pokemon movie with the care bears moral issues it leaves an effect on you again this movie can teach everyone at all ages about morality,positive,1
lapyuta castle in the sky more than any of hayao miyazakis movies brings the joy of storytelling to the audience it is the kind of movie that makes one feel like a kid again its just magical its a crime that it took this long for it to be released in the states but now that its here check it out and stick with the original language the dub changed my impressions of the characters somewhat which is something that should be avoided at all costs in a translation of a movie or book whatever  i give it a tenten,positive,1
this movie seems to have a lot of people saying it is one of the most brutal of all time after having just viewed it i can say it does not live up to those claims  the idea of the movie is indeed demented but overall the execution wasnt at all cringe worthy even the final scene the eyeball thing isnt really that nasty i was expecting something insane instead it was of lower quality than gore put forth on films like the ultra low budget violent sht  any one wanting to see an actual movie will be disappointed since there is no story whatsoever though surely most people know this gore fans will be disappointed since contrary to belief the blood and guts here are few and far between not to mention the actress playing the victim might be one of the worst in history  regardless of what people say this movie isnt that shocking it just plain all out sucks avoid it,negative,0
the costumes are outrageous and the australian outback scenery is fun to view but there is an edge to this story  a mean edge  about drag queens i particularly noticed that in terrence stamps character ralph bernadette bassenger perhaps that was appropriate since there is nothing goodguy like about ralphbernadette and his group of queens   once again we get the strong liberal slant which says anything goes and if youre not with it  or in this case prohomosexual then you are a homophobe gasp  whats really disturbing is the ending when a young boy goes off with his alternativelifestyle father and embraces his gay lifestyle not because it fit the story but because it fit the agenda of the people who wrote the script pitiful,negative,0
this movie downshifts from 4th into 1st without bothering with 3rd or 2nd grinding gears all the way to the sappy bmovie finishline the con at the beginning is easily the best and cleverest part of the movie that is worth seeing the scene with harlow in the bathtub occurs so fast you may miss it definitely not worth all the ballyhoo provided by robert osborne in his tcm intro to this badtomediocre confusion there is no real conflict and all of the characters in this supposed fringe society turn out to be saints  especially the unbelievable character al i wonder if hes got a job for me in cincinnati,negative,0
alright i got passed the horrible acting i got passed the fact that lil kim was blasting some cannons and her arms or hands werent moving i got passed the weaves i got passed the colored contacts  this is what killed it for me in the scene where the four roses were sitting at the table arguing lisaraye and monica calhoun stand up and and then lil kim gets up to break up any hostilities by saying whoa whoa whoa hold up lets chill out here for a hot second i am a fan of the western movie genre and i never heard anyone talk slang like this in any of clint eastwoods movies  if anyone thinks this movie deserves over a 1 rating please tell me another movie thats worse than gang of roses  im through,negative,0
i first saw this movie about 20 years ago and have never forgotten it its beautifully filmed and the story keeps one riveted for the entire time its difficult to believe this was made in 1946 as the tale is still fresh today and really makes one think im not very knowledgeable regarding film technique however the special effects in this film are terrific considering when this was made in addition the acting is superb and the use of english and american actors quite astounding i recently purchased the dvd so now im able to watch whenever i wish i highly recommend anyone interested in postwar british films to watch this,positive,1
what more could i say the americans totally hated it because the us cut was so bad although you could detect the underlying goodwill in it  talking about the us theatrical releasealong with the newly released bluray disc version its faster and tighter than hk cut the background musics were all changed from the dark grim hk musics to hiphop musics and there were a lot of gruesome scenes cut out though the dubbing was a notable job given that they tried to capture the original actors voice and tone but the problem is hak hapblack mask the movie was designed and meant to be dark grim superdisturbing and totally gruesome very unfortunately the us release just skimmed the cream they wanted which in return completely changed the movies undertonehk release was rated 18 to be even more comical and amateurish  now lets talk about the original hk release this movie is like a hidden gem a prototype for the whole matrix tide and era the fighting scenes are totally awesome even the camera works were a bit oldschool among hk movies however the style the movie created was a unique blend of kungfu and pop culture with all the leather black costumes and decorations this movie features a batmanlike superhero in a black mask against a runofthemill gang of multinational supersoldiers lead by a punk heavy metal rock star boss yes it sounds like imaginations of a retarded child but it works its so impressive that the whole movies gonna give you nightmares featuring foreigners fighting a bloodbath battle in leather coats in year 2002 they made a sequel which had a pg13 rating but without jet li and liu qing yun and you know how bad that was because li and liu were the core characters in the movie and had strong personalities and an interesting friendship and did i happen to mention francois yip her roundhouse kick was totally cool even cooler than the villain boss because she didnt use a stuntman for all the fighting did i mention she was also smoking hot anyway there are a lot of things to like about the movie  however the movie also suffered from a lot of problems first off its a mediocre script made at its best potential which means this production team deserved a better screenwriter there are a lot climaxes in the entire 100 minutes but they often felt like farfetched and dont totally make senses to the audiencesus version was even worse because all the character developments were cut anyway you cant ask too much out of a comicinspired action movie also this movie is entirely improper for children i wont recommend it to you if you are less than 20 years old its saturated with disturbing contents including blood gore sadomaso costumes extreme brutal violence and so on along with the style of the movie it can be called a wet dream for heavymetal rock music fans and action fans the us cut was milder but if you want to see it see the hk release for what it is 710 status inspiring hidden undervalued adult,positive,1
according to john fords lyrically shot fictional biopic of abraham lincolns life his greatest faults may have been an obtuseness with woman and an ability to dance in the worst way fords camera has only praising views to reveal of mr lincolns early life but for what the film lacks in character complexities it makes up for in beauty and depth of vision uncharacteristically beautiful compositions of early film what could have been a series of gorgeous still frames ford has a unique eye for telling a story the film sings of the life of a hopeful young man henry fonda plays the contemplative and spontaneously clever lincoln to a tee one of his best roles  the film concerns two young men brothers on trial for a murder that both claim to have committed in classic angry mob style the town decides to take justice into their own hands and lynch the pair of them until honest abe steps into the fray he charms them with his humor telling them not to rob him of his first big case and that they are as good as lynched with him as the boys lawyer what follows seems to become the outline for all courtroom murderdramas thereafter as abe cunningly interrogates witnesses to the delight and humor of the judge jury and town before he stumbles upon the missing links  the film plays out like many john ford movies do a tablespoon of americana a dash of moderate predictability a hint of sarcasm that you arent sure if you put in the recipe or if ford did it himself despite the overtly hollywood feel of the film and overly patriotic banter alluding to lincolns future presidency the film is entirely enjoyable and enjoyably well constructed if you can take your drama with a grain of salt,positive,1

i saw this on sale  new  at my local store for 6 and said hey an action film with that guy from bloodsport and enter the dragon directed by the guy who did enter the dragon  and its cheap so i bought it oops this is possibly the worst film ive ever seen and ive seen some doozies  you know how movies which are intentionally campy like evil dead ii and deadalive are awesome you know how movies that are supposed to be serious but turned out so awful that you have to laugh out loud and watch them again like lionheart an old van damme film or john carpenters vampires are pretty cool this film ironheart manages to be neither of those i dont know what the filmmakers were thinking but it looks as if this movie was made with no time to shoot no budget for anything and no script to speak of while im on the script note i should point out that bolo yeung has no lines in this movie  the only reason he gets first billing on the box is the fact that hes the only actor in the film that youll ever recognize unless youre a jackie chan fan in which case youll recognize the bad guy  and youll want to call him giancarlo  whats also sad is that this film is from 92 by that time t2 judgment day had come out so you know that the era of 80s campiness was over but not quite after this youll think 80s chuck norris films highschool comedies and jasonfreddy sequels were works of sheer genius   things to know  1 nobody in this film can act for beans the closest you get is richard norton looking appropriately rich and cocky and bolo yeung looking appropriately mean  and cocky everything else is dreadful  2 the martial arts scenes are forgettable  just many instances of white guys with lots of muscles taking off their shirts yelling running at britton lee getting kicked by britton lee getting punched by britton lee then falling down even the final showdown against bolo is disappointingly short and about as creative as the design of my running socks and equally stinky  3 the rest of the action is pathetic too the guns look like they came from the toy department at kmart and indeed they fire with the sound of a capgun when someone gets shot they bounce around a little bit then lie still with splotches of brownishred liquid on their clothes britton lee apparently gets shot in the side but you dont see it at all then later that day you see the wound  ive had paper cuts that were worse than that  4 of course then the girl dresses the wound then they kiss then next thing you know theyre lying in bed talking after sex huh what believable development of the love interest as well as any kind of character development at all are overlooked completely in this film remember how bruce lees characters didnt need to have sex with anybody to be cool  5 the car chase is by far the worst ive ever seen it looks like the director was sitting on the curb with a handheld camera as the two cars weaved down the road doing oh i dont know about 30 miles an hour dont try this at home kids these people are professionals hah  6 really bad writing heres a scene for you lee is being followed so the girl follows the followers to warn lee but her car is too slow so by the time she catches up lee and the bad guys are out of their cars and theres a gunfight in progress lee has killed two bad guys but the third is shooting at lee when the girl almost runs lee over so the bad guy runs away huh then the girls car stalls and she cant start it she tells lee shes involved now and shes coming with him he points out to her that they cant leave her car there because the bad guys will trace it to her she somehow convinces him that he should decide how to deal with this problem  so he shoots the gas tank and blows up her car and remember later that same night they have sex huh  7 if you look closely in more than half of the nightclub shots the dancers are very much out of sync with the music the dancers are also all way too coordinated with each other apparently in the 80s all people at dance clubs took dancing lessons there is a girl in the dj booth with a microphone but she never does anything except dance the bouncers tell people who are fighting to take it outside  without moving their lips in one scene the only bouncers lee and stevo pass by are just inside the entrance but with their backs to it also apparently if youre a major character in the film you can go straight to the head of the line  8 lee notices the first time he is being followed but he doesnt notice the second time  even though its the same guy in the same car the girl however notices bad guys get followed twice but they never notice  9 lee is worried the bad guys will trace the girls car back to her even though they have already seen him show up where she works twice the girl proceeds to leave her child at work in the care of a friend while she is off having sex with lee do not learn parenting from this film  cant think of more gripes right now  you get the idea  ironheart is so bad it aint even funny its sad,negative,0
i began watching this movie with my girlfriend and after 5 minutes i was alone  i succeed to stay until the end it has been a painful experience  i liked jean hugues anglade but i think that he needed to eat as us and thus he accepted to play in this movie   there are only 5 characters and the rest could be called art or something that i couldnt express but that i didnt understand at all  the only worst movie i saw was crash but im pretty sure now that i have enough experience to watch it successfully again  good luck o,negative,0
have never understood why the macdonaldeddy swan song has always been panned so mercilesslynot just by their detractors but by virtually everyone to me i married an angel is more lively and imaginative than any of the duos more celebrated outings the sets and costumes are as lavish as any to be found in an mgm musical the script is by the reliable anita loos san francisco the women gentlemen prefer blondes etc the rodgers and hart tunes albeit altered a bit by macdonaldeddy regulars bob wright and chet forrest are given celestial treatment by herbert stothart oscarwinner for scoring the wizard of oz and best of all the singing sweethearts look great in their contemporary clothes and seem to be having fun with the bizarre proceedings try to show rose marie or sweethearts to the uninitiated today and they may very well have a hard time sitting still but this offbeat fastpaced fantasy is bound to entertain,positive,1
for those too young to remember or too old to have been part of the hype the michael jackson fad in the earlytomid 80s was at a fever pitch like the hype about titanic except this just didnt let up every song every video every word uttered by michael was important nothing similar had been seen since the heyday of the beatles  i remember seeing this video for the first time at a roller skating rink everyone stopped skating there was no question as to whether you were a michael jackson fan or not you were everyone crowded around the projection screen and watched the video  this is probably one of the longest music videos ever made and definitely the best it perpetually gets 2 on the annual mtv top 100 videos 1 is always the flavorofthemonth and somehow whatever was 1 of all time slips past 2 to make way for the new 1 go figure and thriller became a phenomenon in and of itself  if you ever get the chance you must watch the video not just the excerpts shown on mtv or vh1 if necessary you should search out making of thriller at a video rental store hey your parents probably made you watch beatles and woodstock footage because it was important well this is important too,positive,1
wow i loved this movie this film was filled with plot twists good acting great story and a surprising ending to be completely honest this movie wasnt overly gory it does contain some gore though but was more on the psychological side i read it on the internet the film cost 3000 dollars and was shoot in 8 days amazing this is for someone that wants to think and loves great film making what starts out as a terrorizing thriller slowly transforms into something a bit more twisted even a bit more sinister not much i can say without giving away plot points only that this movie went beyond my expectations,positive,1
out of all the films i could have chosen it had to be this when i was last in new york i went into a times square store and out of the hundreds of dvds they had i chose joel m reeds bloodsucking freaks 1976 and this on a double feature dvd that also included seeds of sin 1968 did i regret it read on to find out the film opens on an island near milligans staten island home where two lovers are walking along with a massive parasol seemingly made from paper at one point he gives her the top of a weed as a gift out of nowhere colin hal borske a retarded hunchback pops up and kills both of them for no reason at all after the opening credits which are joined by some of the worst headache inducing music i have ever heard at least it got me used to it as its used constantly throughout the film we are introduced to three couples the wives are all sisters vicky ann linden and ricard fib lablaque veronica eileen hayes and bill don williams plus elizabeth carol vogel and donald richard ramos they each receive a letter from a lawyer h dobbs neil flanagan that request a meeting so he can read their late fathers will dobbs informs them that they must spend three days in their childhood home crenshaw house and fill it with sexual harmony and marital love that it had never known because of the strained relationship between their father and mother he informs the couples that the will is highly irregular but legal after three days the inheritance will be settled the couples are also told about the servants martha veronica radburn hattie maggie rodgers and the retarded colin who welcomes the couples by killing and biting chunks out of a rabbit in front of them later on that night whats left of the dead rabbit is found in one of the couples beds with a note that says blessed are the meek for they shall inherit this starts a series of events which end in gruesome murder and reveals dark family secrets  cowritten photographed and directed by the talentless andy milligan this is an absolutely horrible film in every way possible lets go through just some of its faults the music its awful and headache inducing sound you can barely hear what characters are saying and certain scenes dont have any sound effects plus at certain points you can hear milligan shouting out orders to his actors oh and theres a constant hiss on the soundtrack throughout as well the acting probably among the worst i have ever witnessed the very unspecial effects colin pokes someones eye out in the opening sequence its the size of a tennis ball the part where someone is tied down and has his stomach opened up with a saw looks really awful as are the various hands and legs that are chopped off photography milligan has absolutely no idea how to stage or film a scene he regularly cuts the top bottom or sides of peoples heads and faces off the screen and his camera jerks and shakes around like its operated by someone who is constantly tripping over there is also at least one scene so badly thought out and filmed that a crew member is seen the film is often so dark you cant see whats happening too editing again some of the worst ive ever sat through he seems to cut scenes before theyve finished cutting away while characters are in the middle of a sentence the script if there was one credited to both milligan and hal sherwood it took two people to write this is all over the place and is incredibly stupid there is one unbelievably bad sequence where the killer follows a victim down into the basement the killer walks right behind him at one point the potential victim turns around what does the killer do to avoid being spotted they duck down right in from of him the killers close enough to give the guy oral sex yet he doesnt notice them right in front of him you have to see this sequence to believe it i still cant believe what i saw bizarre sub plots just happen and then totally disappear check the scene out when richard has to borrow money from his brother walter producer and cowriter hal sherwood who turns out to be a gay priest who has had an incestuous relationship with his brother before he was married a strange scene thats there for no reason at all martha the housekeepers reaction to the first murder shes more bothered by the fact that its thrown her dinner schedule out theres load of insane dialogue as well patty and martha discuss colin patty says if only i didnt beat him so hard martha sympathetically replies you have to patty you have to delivered totally straight faced and dont start me on how ugly the wallpaper looks throughout the house the only good thing i can think of saying is that the costumes look reasonable for the time period its meant to be set in i could probably go on all day about how amateurish this is but i think you get the idea one to avoid unless your a serious masochist i didnt regret buying or watching it for a second though,negative,0
1st watched 7292001  4 out of 10 dirmark dindal fastpaced frantic animation effort by ted turners feature animation group plays a lot like tv cartoons and leaves a lot to be desired in the area of likeable characters but definetly has extremely unlikeable villains im not even sure why the kids would like this movie because there are so many references to old movie stars that kids know very little or nothing about mediocre effort at best despite raves on the box comparing it to disney efforts like aladdin and lion king dont let this fool you  there is no comparison in story or quality,negative,0
i starred as eugene morris jerome in my high school adaptation of the play and this film definitely doesnt live up to the script or the imagination of neil simon i know this play backwards and forwards and i can honestly tell you that the acting was off the production was cheesy the changes in the plays script were poorly done if you want to really enjoy this play you should see the actual play not a hollywood movie adaptation the eugene character lacked soul and was overly sarcastic in all he said the other characters were off key as well a general disappointment messy disloyal to the play amateurishly executed,negative,0
what gives this movie its personality is the knowledge in the end that it is all true while it is a compelling and humorous documentary that does border on mockumentary in some parts are they staged or is it really happening humorously it does seem to get a bit long towards the end  this movie is funny in places it needs to be and flows relatively well reminiscent of christopher guests movies if you liked those or adaptation then i recommend you keep a look out for this one  b,positive,1
its very hard to say just what was going on with the lady from shanghai and what the film could have been without studio interference orson welles prime interest in film at this point was to raise money for his theater indeed funding his own projects is what drove him to seek out acting jobs he made lady from shanghai for his soon to be exwife rita hayworth harry cohn was fearful for ritas image and held back the release of this movie for one year  the plot concerns an irish sailor michael ohara who falls in love with else hayworth stunning with short blond hair her husband is a well known criminal attorney arthur bannister everett sloane who is as crippled on the inside as he is out he hires ohara to work on his yacht and there ohara is drawn deeper and deeper into a web of murder and deceit  the lady from shanghai moves at a snails pace though i agree with one of the posters that films today are criticized for taking time to build a plot still this movie drags the scene in the fun house is fantastic  welles wanted it without music though and i believe the studio cut it down its a shame the photography throughout is stunning atmospheric bold and very stylish  welles was an excellent actor handsome in his youth charismatic and possessing a magnificent voice and technique but in many films its almost as if he doesnt trust himself or doesnt take the time to develop a character instead he relies on externals such as accents and fake noses one of the only times he didnt do this was tomorrow is forever where the director gets an excellent deeply felt performance out of him contrast that with compulsion where he shows he is a master of pure technical acting as he phones in his performance here welles is doing quadruple duty  as director star cowriter and narrator sporting a completely unnecessary accent and looking intense was a fast way to a characterization nevertheless he is always compelling  the supporting players are excellent including sloan and glenn anders hayworth gorgeous and softvoiced her singing was again dubbed by anita ellis is as usual a complete goddess and one of the great screen presences what a sad life for such a vibrant beauty  any film that orson welles directed is worth seeing and the lady from shanghai is no exception but this one leaves the viewer frustrated as does the magnificent ambersons  as does any work that welles did within the studio system he was a great artist who should have been given a freer reign he wasnt he was a strange dichotomy  he needed more freedom but as is evidenced by some of his later work he needed the structure of the studio alas he couldnt have both,positive,1
i loved this movie great storyline and actors and good movie sets it told the story in a way i can easily understand and pay attention to without falling asleep i would like to know where i could get the soundtrack i can not find it anywhere please email me if you know where i could get the soundtrack other than not being able to find the soundtrack i thought the movie was fascinating swayze did a great job i think this is some of his best work his past movies were ok but this one really told a story for a change this will go down in history as being one of the best tv films ever aired congrats to the producers and writers of such a great piece of work,positive,1
awful in a badgood waythis movie has officially become the worst made for tv movie in my bookexcept for the camp value it offers i give it a 1 in quality and a 10 for the camp value suggestion watch with friends champagne and plenty of popcornyoull want to throw some at the screen preferably friends who like chris noth from his sex in the city daysthis movie is dreadfully funny this is definitely the lowest point in the careers of all cast membershonestly i dont know how they controlled the laughter as the lines were delivered daniel j travanti is absolutely pathetic everyone participated in the school of over acting and poor joan van ark i believe she was the only one taking this theater of the absurd seriouslyshe is credited as a producer though her mom jeans and bad plastic surgery are scene stealers this movie also crosses the oh so delicate line of social incorrectness when they introduce a mentally challenged character into the plot this is an obscure movie showing on lifetime listed as with harmful intenthas anyone else had the pleasure,negative,0
awesomely improbable and foolish potboiler that at least has some redeeming crisp location photography but its too unbelievable to generate much in the way of tension i was kinda hoping that stanwyck wouldnt make it back in time because really she was saddled with the wet in more ways than one husbandand she had an idiot child as wellwhy not run off with meeker but the nagging question remainswhat sort of wood was that pier support made of if a rotten piece of it pulled off didnt float stanwyck always impeccably professional does the best she could with the material but its threadbare,negative,0
bad acting bad writing this was a poorly written film its too bad because it had some potential its not even close to american pie or something about mary as previous comments might have you believe rent it at dollar night from you local video store if youre kind of bored,negative,0
its hard to make a bad movie with the underdog finally succeeds sport theme but this movie succeeds admirably my mind boggles at how pointless and boring this film is  i guess the director couldnt decide whether this was about the runner or the coach it ends up being about neither ultimately who cares neither character has a likable personality there is nothing in the movie to make you care about anyone even the bad guy isnt really bad i think hes in two scenes and seemingly is on some kind of barbituate  i think he asks her once and politely to leave the coach and train with him then later he kinda sorta asks her to move in with him thats it conflict tension what will she do   and whats with the depiction of running has the director ever seen an actual marathon christines form is so incorrect its absurd as is the form of the supposed champion she competes with a character with no lines maybe they could have hired you know an actual runner  and the speed the run at is beyond comprehension were they running or speed walking its actually laughable i can literally walk backwards faster then they were running in the big race maybe it was too hard to move the cameras at real speed  another absurdity spoiler i guess at one point in the big race the two women in the lead inexplicably fall at the same time what they fell on is a mystery maybe they both just got exhausted and fell down and then they get up but dont start running again for maybe 30 seconds oh yeah very realistic this ridiculous event doesnt even add any tension since the other runners are not close and besides at this point you have been numbed into a state of catatonia  i especially enjoyed how all four of her male teammates highly trained athletes all drop out of the big race due to charliehorses or pulled tendons or something just as improbable   but who cares this movie has almost no tension no resolution nothing some woman runner with absolutely no personality is discovered by an old boring coach with some past failure that is barely hinted at they train a lot she is not happy they train some more she wins da big race woopie   my description is actually more interesting than the actual movie i just saved you 90 minutes avoid this one like the plague,negative,0
ive never read a good review for vanity fair and i cant understand why for something that was rushed through in ten days it all comes off surprisingly well though admittedly becky sharp is a better movie and miriam hopkins a better becky theres nothing to stop this one from getting a solid 910 at times myrna loy might seem just too cute and nice to be playing an utter bitch but at other times she just has to squint her eyes and the air temperature drops a dozen degrees meow the move to a more modern setting did not work against vanity fair and the only thing that really causes some conflict is the casting barbara kent amelia was under 5 feet in height and few of the leading men were very tall either  this all coming together to make loy look like an absolute amazon woman  vanity fair is similar to craigs wife in that no matter how bad the main character is you have to love her and you know she deserves her comeuppance and then some but you still feel sorry for her when she gets it though based on the same story as becky sharp this version had a different ending which is interesting to see because most of the rest of the films were almost identical for pleasure value the ending of becky sharp is ultimately more enjoyable although aesthetically and from the flow of the story there is no doubt that the ending of vanity fair is the better one whether or not you actually like it,positive,1
fidois a very odd film and in many ways a very good one  my first thought after viewing was how the hell are they going to market this thing if shaun of the dead is a romantic comedy with zombies fido is a boy and his dog story blended with fifties nostalgia comedy with zombies doesnt exactly trip off the tongue  fido has little of shauns carnage gore  belly laughs it is a different beast altogether forgive the pun  fido kicks off with a black  white information film that explains the back story  humans have won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that subdues the flesheaters into dumb servants  at first i thought we we were in for a fifties cold war paranoia parody a la matinée but we are soon hurled into a world of bright primary colours and fifties middleclass nostalgia  young timmy robinon is a lonely kid who doesnt fit in at school his mom is wouldbe social climberand his dad is nervy and detached  seeking to keep up with the joneses mom carryanne moss has acquired a zombie jimmy is disinterested at first but fido billy conelley soon proves a great buddy for jimmy until his collar goes on the blink  fido is not a horror film but my problem with the movie is figuring out exactly what it is  much of the humour is of the light family variety and sometimes the plot line is too heavily reliant on the boy and his dogfamily moments  yet the film is shot through with wonderfully dark truly funny moments which while welcome will ensure an r rating for what is for extended periods a family comedy  the film looks gorgeous and is wonderfully performed by all involved  despite its difficult tonal problems i hope this movie finds a niche as its quite a little gem in this years deluge of cinematic crap,positive,1
while i was the video store i was browsing through the one dollar rentals and came upon this little gem i dont know what it was about it but i just had a gut instic about it and wow was i ever right  the story centers around two girls who have just survived a school shooting one of the girls is alicia a teenage reble who is the only witness for the full attack and another is deanna another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by some miracle thrown together by fate they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving on  i just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks because wow what a performance by busy phillips and erkia christensen not to mention the rest of the cast my only complaint is that the dvd was sorely lacking in special features oh and some of the jump cuts in the movie were kind of jarring but all in all a excellent movie,positive,1
black vengeance is an alternate title for ying hung ho hon aka tragic hero 1987 i have just seen this on vhs together with the first part of the story gong woo ching rich and famous also 1987 the poster and 2 stills featured on the page are for a 4dvd set of movies starring rod perry the black gestapo fred williamson black cobra 2 richard lawson black fist the fourth movie is called the black six strangely while the characters retain their original names in rich and famous in black vengeance chow yunfats character is named eddie shaw alex man man tze leung is harry and andy lau is called johnny also confusing is the fact that 1994 is given as the copyright dates on both films perhaps that was the year they were americandubbed according to the release dates given on imdb tragic hero was released before rich and famous was there any reason for releasing the sequel first despite some users comments i enjoyed these films although they arent among cyfs best such as the killer and hardboiled which are truly astonishing howeverif one day i come across a 2dvd set of rich and famous and tragic hero i wont hesitate to buy it hopefully these comments about black vengeance clear up which was also for me a mystery as to where it belonged in chow yunfats filmography,negative,0

so what constitutes a real independent film in a day and age where the latest fad of mainstream hollywood is to appear rugged and cutting edge im sorry to say that what the general public tends to perceive as independent film is usually nothing more than a clever marketing ploy  which is why we should be glad that films like hatred of a minute exist across the board this film makes a point out of contradicting its own template indie horror film love it or hate it hatred isnt afraid of being what it is and in watching this film you get the real sense that kallio the director didnt just make this film to spray fake blood all over the place hes in this to tell stories good ones you may find this film in the horror film section of your video store but dont be fooled this story is also about love about good people pushed over the edge and that ohsodistant light at the end of the tunnel  if you expect smut or an evil dead ripoff stay away from this film but if you dig the finer points of the horrorsuspense genres check this film out  yes bruce campbell did produce this movie and im sure hes proud to tell anyone that its not evil dead bruce has never tried to bank on his ash image and its obvious that he didnt get involved with hatred so that it could do so either  my advice though to all deadites rabidly devouring anything issued by mr campbell is to check this film out anyway and see what else mr kallio and mr campbell are trying to show you  the acting is well done although nothing about this film is oscar caliber perhaps intentionally its good to see compassionate performances in a horror film so often actors in films such as these dont even seem to try with hatred it seemed as though all the actors took thier charecters very seriously never resorting to typical horrorfilm campiness  technically hatred is about as competent as indie film gets the editing is fast paced the cinematography is good given the budget and hatred keeps a quick pace without any bogdown points or bad anticlimaxes  all in all hatred may not have the glossed over look of all those multimillion dollar fake indies but personally i dont see a problem with that its a film by folks who actually care about the medium people who reached into thier broke ass pockets pulled out thier nickles and dimes threw caution to the wind and made a damn good movie  check this one out,positive,1
this is my favorite movie ever i have watched it at least 10 times and i cry every time my family begs me not to watch it so i wont have a crying fit i think i love that it is a true story written by antwone himself just as much as i love the movie the acting is top notch and the actors were perfect for their role denzel washington is one of my favorite actors but this is my favorite movie he has done so far i took care of a little boy who was also born in jail he was the most precious little boy i had ever met he has now been adopted by a wonderful family who fought for him for almost two years i saw this movie while the fight was still going on and his future was unsure and i am so happy he is safe and loved and i am so happy antwones happy and found his family  i would love to know more about him and how it has been since meeting his family i just cant say enough good things about it,positive,1
i watched pola x because scott walker composed the film score and i admire his music a lot frankly i expected a somewhat pretentious and possibly incoherent french movie i was wrong the vision of the film quickly managed to engage my attention to the fullest  starting with the opening sequence which shows black and white footage of military airplanes throwing bombs at graves at the sounds of music and scott walkers beautiful wailing voice the film explores the identity crisis of pierre guillaume depardieu  a brilliant choice for the role and his consequential selfdestruction the story is divided into two parts  the first depicts pierres carefree life in a beautiful house in the french countryside and the second follows his utter personal disintegration after he abandons everything and moves to paris to live in squalor with his supposed halfsister both parts contain some amazingly stunning photography  the first very colorful and bright the second utterly gloomy and nearly apocalyptic  adding up to a true aesthetic feast pola x is a fascinating and quite unique movie experience,positive,1
i suffered the watching of this movie at sitges festival last month if there would be a possibility of unfilm a movie to avoid its existence this should be the first in the list maría lidón isnt a director she is just a dumb woman that pretends that holding a camera with the hand and shout action makes her a professional film maker what a mistake the movie itself is pointless and a total waste of good actors that could be doing something better in another project val kilmer does nothing but place his face in front of the camera his character dont have specific weight in the movie the same thing can tell about joss ackland vincent gallo or joaquim de almeida its a shame the way rade serbedzijas character has been written warning spoilers  he spends most of the time alone in the tunnels talking with himself in the way now im doing this now im low of bats ill search in my bag now im turning left now im turning right only to bring the audience a clear idea about his actions its simply nonsense and proves the lack of talent of the director end of spoilers  the usual joke about this piece of garbage among the audience was that the title of the movie itself brought the clue about the rating everyone should give it zero,negative,0
i saw that this movie was coming out and could not wait to see it i have to say i was very disappointed with it this would have been better as a miniseries the whole show seemed very rushed they did not explain things very clearly at the end they showed john paul ii alive and well and the next scene he was dead never any explanation as to what happened we all know what happened in real life i think abc dropped the ball big time on something that could have been great in all i think this movie was a blur it seemed like a drunken monkey jumping around from one point in john pauls life to another point never explaining how or why things happened such as when his older brother leaves it was never explained that his brother was a doctor and that is why he left home also when his father dies all we see is his father lying on the floor and that was that i was very disappointed with the over all movie,negative,0
this movie is awesome due to the fact that it showed how good cartoons really looked in the 80sthe animators were not lazy like they are todaythe cartoon had so much detail with very little resources they have with them compared with what we have todayif more people would request these cartoons to be rebroadcast then maybe all of the other 80s cartoons would be shown on television once againtherefore to finish my sentence i would just like to say that this was a cartoon that i grew up with and really would like it to be on tv once again,positive,1
im guessing that the movie was based on a hefty book given the number of characters and subplots during katyn i thought that the movie creators perhaps the writer or director intended to create an epic movie but really there wasnt enough time to properly spend on developing characters or story aggravatingly there were many unrelated sidestories that could have been edited out  in relating the events leading up to the massmurder of all these intellectuals and officers i dont think the movie explained any reasons why murder was necessary was it political philosophical revenge the interesting part of historical movies are seeing personal motivations or emotions instead the murderers of katyn seemed like automatons controlled entirely by stalin whos appears occasionally framed as a charcoal sketch the portrayal of the russians and germans seemed entirely onedimensional are polish people just that angry at the russians besides being badly edited and biased or at least unrealistic choices of music and cinematography felt mismatched to each other and to the movie itself i dont think you can really shoot an epic war film or war event on handheld camera but if the director went with a characterdriven story perhaps by focusing on a single family maybe the handycam approach would have worked better and if you use really dramatic music it needs to be better balanced to the type of shots made,negative,0
before the internet this movie could never have been made but the idea that the web is full of evil is the idea behind itunfortunately thats all it wasthe generally opinion that nowadays the web in the wring hands can create as much chaos as anything in real life since the late 90s somebody found out that you could create a virus which would disable a computerthe point just to do something plain evil by remote control so its the cyber equivalent of robbery with violencewhich is basically what spam is without the violenceits conning you into parting with your money and has been going so long its a wonder anybody takes any notice of it nowadays so they get cleverer and use real names as doing something illegal isnt a priority we see the internet get worse by the weekthe social networking sites or chat room which lead to evil and the child porn sites which are illegal so the idea of a movie which invites people to click a name is just the same old thingthere actually is a site called horrorvision which is a porn sitebut this one kills the people who enter its portals the story though is so disjointed its boring with it and comes to no conclusion the definitive movie on this theme of destroying an internet service provider has yet to be made but clearly many do need destroying as they wont be shut down when theres money to be made calling this a horror film is rather misleading as it bores not frightens,negative,0
warning dont even consider watching this film in any form its not even worth downloading from the internet every bit of porn has more substance than this wasted piece of celluloid the socalled filmmakers apparently have absolutely no idea how to make a film they couldnt tell a good joke to save their lives its an insult to any human being if youre looking for a funfilled movie  go look somewhere else  lets hope this mr unterwaldt the jr being a good indication for his obvious inexperience and intellectual infancy dies a slowpainful death and never makes a film again  in fact its even a waste of time to write anything about this crap thats why ill stop right now and rather watch a good film,negative,0
most of us kids growing up in the 40s or 50s were western buffs but this was one that had escaped me until seeing on the movies for men channel today i loved the films story cinematography as well as the superb casting of ben johnson and harry carey jr in the lead roles along with the ever dependable ward bond apparently this movie was the inspiration for the later television series wagon train which featured bond once again as the boss of the wagon trains heading west johnson steals the film with his horse riding skills and its nice to see an actor doing his own stunts like ben does in this movie other notables include the lovely joanne dru as denver and an early non speaking role for james arness who later became famous for his marshal matt dillon role in gunsmoke if you like films of this genre you cant fail to like this one,positive,1
over the past century there have been many advances in gender equality but not so much in the world of movies im not talking about what goes on behind the camera im referring to the tastes of the audience the idea of a chick flick is alive and well today while there are still plenty of action and horror films which appeal primarily to males sure there are men and women who enjoy the movies that fall outside of their typical demographic but there arent many movies which have appeals across the board hitch the latest will smith vehicle attempts to change that trend by being a chick flick which throws in a dose of male perspective  smith stars in hitch as the title character alex hitch hitchens a date doctor who trains men on how to approach a woman and have a successful date hitch enjoys his job and loves to see men successfully accomplish their goals of going out with the woman of their dreams but due to a bad experience in college hitch himself is somewhat sullied on the idea of love as the story unfolds the film introduces two seemingly separate story lines hitchs latest case is albert brennaman kevin james an accountant who is very attracted to one of his clients the beautiful heiress allegra cole amber valletta hitch has his doubts about alberts chances but if his clients desires seem sincere hitch supports them  in the mean time hitch meets gossip columnist sara melas eva mendes and is instantly attracted to this strong woman however the date doctor cant seem to follow his own advice in pursuing sara things get even more complicated when saras job leads her to investigate the relationship between the accountant and the heiress will hitch be able to balance his private life and his job and more importantly can hitch believe in love again if you are a true movie fan then theres been at least one time in your life when youve complained about the redundancy of the hollywood movie factory and cried out for something new and original well hitch aint that movie but most movie fans will also admit that occasionally a formulaic movie can work solely on an entertainment level hitch does qualify as that film,positive,1

i had some time to kill before watching football so i saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it i thought i had encountered my version of mentally walking the bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the mummy series and jurassic park it was so bad that i thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup the acting was so bad that i was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end the lead by casper van dien made me long for the high caliber acting of steven seagal in on deadly ground as his line reading was so wooden that woody woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder i also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that i was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat  the direction was so abysmal i looked back yearning to my nephews grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage the fx of the movie was so bad that i thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade z horror flicks from yesteryear what robert wagner tom bosley and geoffrey lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie my warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your iq to diminish with prolonged viewing on a side note i noticed at imdb that sometimes salaries for movies are published i was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies beware and be safe avoid at all costs,negative,0

its said that this film is or was banned in the us since it was released since there is no information on imdb i must rely on my other sources and believe it if this is really true the movie is even more hurtful and frightening and is it is anyway  the movie is a socalled mockumentary although i think the topic is too serious call it like that it creates a scenario where america is like a military state and all revolutionary objects are arrested immediately without proof after an obligatory tribunal they have to decide if they go to prison for some years or choose the punishment park in that they have to walk through the desert for three days to reach an american flag posted 50 miles ahead while theyre are followed by police and army troops  the movie itself pretends to be a documentary about these incidents and follows both the tribunals and the hunting through the desert filmed by european film crews all the facts are explained the interviewers ask questions and film everything people stare directly into the camera shouting at it it seems very very real talking about realism here is nonsense this movie is not about how to make a realistic film it is about how such a film would look like if it was real and it certainly would look like this if it would be filmed anyway in an utopian state like this there surely wouldnt be a european film crew allowed to film those things  there are many things that frighten us the defendants are people from all social classes political leaders musicians authors philosophists unemployed etc they seem to be hopeless rebellious or scared they are no heroes they talk a lot in the tribunal knowing it doesnt lead to anything saying nevertheless all they said in speeches and books and songs before one says hes not afraid to die is this true well he doesnt have to run through the desert hunted by cops the defendants have no chance or at least their only chance the decision between prison and punishment park is no chance really the way they decide in the end and the way film ends makes it clear that this kind of heroism is suicide  these tribunals remind us a lot of tribunals in the third reich the officials use the same kind of idealistic speeching ignoring all the arguments from the defendants starting to scream at them and then telling them they should be quiet they warn the defendants of watching their language and insult them much more they ask them questions the defendants can not answer but its never intendend they should these scenes are a statement about what we call justice  the scenes in the desert are on a different level when we see the prisoners for the first time we realize that they realize they havent got a chance seeing the desert and the mountains feeling the sun and the thirst they dont have a clue how they should stand this free days the film crew follows them and talks to them while they try to escape this madness they argue should they play the game or escape or revolt it all leads to the same and no one is surprised some will question if such parks would exist in reality in such a state why not it empties the prisons and allows the government to punish the revolutionaries as they want to it is not a gas chamber but the nazis killed jews before concentration camps were built the comparison is fair since they is no real difference  the movie is scary and depressing the problems that are talked about sound to familiar to ignore these is not sciencefiction talking about poverty unemployment and crime is not utopic the film shows us that government and democracy as it is presented to us is not only useless but dangerous it also shows us that revolution is not definitely the solution the defendants seem to be confused because they dont really know how to fight this they do things but for nothing even is this delivers no solution to us it still is a statement  to me the most frightening thing is the fact of the banning of this movie here we have a film that accuses the loss of freedom moral and peace it accuses the government a fictional goverment nevertheless to be dangerous and inhuman and such a film is banned think about it when you see the american flag the next time,positive,1
this is sweet the actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays elvira mistress of the dark another little tidbit is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the landlord lady of roy munsin in king pin this is most glorious story ever to be told it should sell more copies than the bible my parents played a part in suggesting the release of this movie to a local movie theater the movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it the lady who gave the go ahead friend of the family was let go by the theater i was 3 years old i have burned through 4 copies on vhs and finally had it converted to dvd its beautiful,positive,1

while being one of the stars of this film doesnt necessarily give me sage insight i do know quite a bit of what was first thereand what ended up on the screen i remember seeing the original cut of incoming freshman and being very pleased it was funny sexy raunchy all the main requirements of a drivein film you have to remember this was shot and released before all the restanimal house porkys etcso in its own way this flick was truly ahead of its time for whatever reasons the film was given to the main distributors who editing out half the original film and then edited in should i say shuffled the most random scenes ever the fat guy the people with goat headswhat the heck was all that im sure it was put in for additional ta but it was so slowly paced it caused anything going on prior to it to grind to a screeching and painful halt but all in all its a fun memory for meespecially in that im able to say that the worst movie ive ever seenim in,negative,0
the 1960s were a time of change and awakening for most people social upheaval and unrest were commonplace as people spokeout about their views racial tensions politics the vietnam war sexual promiscuity and drug use were all part of the daily fabric and the daily news this film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining movie and largely succeeded  in this film two families are followed one white one black during the first half of the film the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles unfortunately the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family admittedly there are more characters in this family and the story lines are intermingled but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century  on the whole the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie the movie is a work of fiction but clips of wellknown historical figures are used to set the timeline  i enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the storyline was onesided,negative,0
after all the hype i had heard about the jane austin novel and different film versions of the book i found myself very disappointed with the movie i had expected a classic drama but that was not the case first of all let me preface my review with the fact that i love old movies particularly mysteries and dramas but not female oriented movies this probably makes a huge difference so take my review with a large grain of salt i thought the acting was a bit over the top but that is very common in movies of this era june allyson was good as jo but i found every sister to be stereotypical and form driven there were no surprises or overly dramatic moments i hate writing negative reviews but the movie left me very cold it has always been my intention to read the book but after this that seem unlikely the only warming story line was between the old gentlemen and the youngest sister that was a very welcome bright spot in an otherwise disappointing viewing experience again there are others who love this movie im just not one of them,negative,0
i see this movie as a poor tribute to the old slasher movies because it really doesnt hold a candle to the 70s and 80s goldera of horror this is of course where personal taste comes in  this movie just falls into the category of new generation of slashers in my book the cast is the typical ones 1824 years and potential models im personally quite tired of that image in horror movies the old movies at least had some variation in people one or more fat people and dorks in general just plain looking persons of course having a couple of good lookers is fine they always been there but when the entire cast is just a bunch of nice racks and butts its getting silly i mean ok yeah i like to watch hot chicks but not in a horror that is supposed to reflect some ordinary people getting hunted down by for example a knifewielding maniac you expect the people being hunted to look something like any random person you see on the street i think there are of course a few movies with just good lookers that is perfectly alright but they arent many wrong turn is one example of the better ones  next point is the killing scenes that slashers should be all about in this poor movie all you get to see is 23 frames of sudden high pitched soundscream and music in crescendo and thats it the little you do get to see isnt very graphical at all not for people who have seen some horrors during the years the oldschool slashers compared to this had much more and better death blood and gore not to mention the killers in those movies who surpassed the one youll get to see here  as for true horror fans it is more fun and exciting to watch horrors with new approaches because of the originalities that pops up the killer in this one doesnt add anything new and fresh to the genre in my opinion i have to agree with what someone previously stated as well the cgi is something i hate to watch personally i preffere the makeups in that sense im conservative unless the cgi is really well done but most importantly is to set a good setting of mood which allows you to get into the movie a good background story is one very good thing also revealing and explaining too much of everything in a movie to the viewers takes away all sense of mystic that adds very much of the mood and doesnt give you much to think about just as an example keeping the killers background a complete mystery for the viewer is a good move in many cases i mean if everything about the story or the people in it has to be explained or shown in detail then its not much content left over for the viewer at all to ponder about thats like watching a porno movie and hope for a great story in the meantime  why the oldschool slashers still works at least for some people is because they are established cult movies from the era when they were a new thing making new ones of that sort today is admittedly hard the exception might be for people who are newer to that sort of horrors of course i have noticed that many people does like this sort of horror movies so there are of course not a right taste for horror movies  but for people out there that might share my opinion here you have a frame of reference what to expect of this flick,negative,0
i own 2 home entertainment stores and ive seen a lot of bad movies in my time but this one was so bad it compelled me to register here and comment on it how bad was it lets just say that sofia coppola deserved an oscar for her performance in godfather iii when compared to giada colagrandes in this movie  it was robotic and uninspired her lover has just died one month prior to her arrival at the rubber house he had given her once there she discovers he has cheated on her throughout her relationship but none of it seems to register with her within a day she starts a relationship with leslie dafoe the caretaker of the house even though she is married to dafoe off screen her scenes with him were cold and unemotional  if there was a plot i missed it not even willem dafoe could save this movie from the amateur cinematic train wreck that it is,negative,0
one of the dumbest movies in the history of cinema wait i take that back this movie cant be included in any category related to cinema it belongs in categories like waste turds or similar categories ironically its even about two garbagemen the movie is men at work a lightweight crime comedy starring the estevez sheen brothers from 1990 setting aside the asinine and implausible plot line bad acting bad dialogue poorly executed stunts and slapstick continuity errors and high rate of noname actors never to be seen again all in all it was a pretty bad movie anyway at its core i mean it was the kind of movie that might be good for one thing you can watch it about 200 times learn every line and in a campy kind of way repeat them back and forth in public with your wasted friends thus securing your status as the biggest dorks in your tenth grade class  to make matters worse i actually submitted an imdb trivia entry along with this bad review to the movies imdb web page if only because i spotted a silly little punk music joke that apparently nobody else spotted yetabout the butthole surfer statue im so conflicted about why i should even waste my time submitting what looks like a supportive trivia note when what i really want to do is blow up emilios acting career no wait hes already done that himself thanks dude im so glad i wasted only time on this not real money for that matter can i maybe have at least one tenth of their budget anyone other than this director emilio could have made two or three much better movies with just what they spent blowing up cars carefully placing bikiniclad bimbos in the background and beating up useless extras henchmen in hazmat suits id mention emilios writing credit but it would be a stretch to call this screenplay writing  its more like crayonscrawled cartoon ideas and charlie sheen if youre reading this i assume maw must have been made during the part of your career in which you were a cokedup hookerloving hollywood brat who had not grown up yet oops sorry i guess that part of your life isnt over yet get well soon you half a man such a promising talent so wasted oh look theres that word again,negative,0

im sorry to say this but i didnt enjoy this movie at all it was just too boring so boring that i couldnt watch the rest of it its not as interesting as the lion king or aladdin thats why i hate this stupid days because these days are just not what they used to be the movies that disney have released lately really sucks i miss the old days when they used to produce good movies like the lion king aladdin pocahontas cinderella the aristocats and robin hood this movie is really awful i really tried my best to be interested in this movie but i just couldnt i dont think i could recommend this film to anyone i would recommend the ones that i just mention above,negative,0

this was the most unrealistic movie i ever seen  i cant believe that the writer and director didnt see that almost all the movie looks like a sf one  for example   1 it is impossible for the killer to stay on cold glaze and after 10 hours to get up so quickly  2 you cant get electrocuted trough a water pipe like in the moviebelieve me its my domain  3 with a saw you can cut 10 pipes in 10 hour very easy lets say that the chain was made from steel but the water pipe was rusty and it was made from iron  4 if you try to cut your foot with a saw you faint in the best case its more likely to die because your hart fails before to get to the boneshin  and there are more other examples,negative,0
this was like watching the trailer of a up and coming movie except that there was no movie coming up the film is so unsatisfying and obviously unfinished as to be almost laughable the subject of this film is over a very short time frame and frankly nothing much actually happens in the 90 odd minutes of screen time i was hoping for the definitive australian film about our soldiers in wwii and how they fought against incredible odds in awful conditionsthis is most certainly not it   having said that the acting was great and locations authentic this could easily have been a great movie given a lot more money and time instead it isnt even mediocre and i cannot recommend it at all,negative,0
you can generally ask two questions concerning 80s lowbudget horror films and this demon wind in particular 1 is it a good film no 2 is it a fun film you bet demon wind is a gruesomely filthy and nauseating tale filled with cheesy makeup effects and nasty violence the story is pretty much nonexistent and involves a group of young people revealing the horrible secrets of one of the groups ancestors apparently his grandparents used to live in a devilworshiping neighborhood and evil in the form of demons and fog still dwells around there but i got to hand it to this filmfrom start to finish it breathes morbidity the diabolical undertones the playful gore and the relatively decent acting all together make this film raise high above the mainstream uninspired 80s slashers for sure it shows some creativity and guts literally where other productions from this decade fall into routine and oblivion more easily this creators clearly got inspired by the success of the evil dead and perhaps even lamberto bavas demons but what the heck its fun and made with lots of enthusiasm althoughthis film does have a pretty high what the f standard at times especially near the end when flashbacks and laser shows are happily being mixed and what the hell is the story on those two wannabe magicians nonetheless demon wind gets my recommendation if your likes arent too high concerning crap horror,negative,0
i recall so many things about seeing this movie back during its original theatrical release  the post woodstock afterglow of peace and love along with the prewatergate tension of fear and paranoia its hard to believe that its thirty seven years later and i can still remember the thoughts going through my head while watching the film with my best friend like marveling at peter boyles characterization of the ultimate redneck sure to typecast him the rest of his career oh how wrong and how the counter culture jarred the sensibilities of most of the country to this day my buddy and i still use joe currans line from my summary above when faced with a dilemma curious how a simple line like that can stay with you for decades  its curious to read comments about the film from others on this board particularly the ones stating that the film has a dated quality and how over the top the characters were still if you were around during that time the picture gives a pretty accurate portrayal of the polar opposites that existed back then pretty much side by side as the events in the story reveal if you really want dated when was the last time you heard the words macys and gimbels in the same sentence or a line like joes  come on get with the pepsi generation for historical perspective you have that great nixon poster lingering in one of the background scenes  would you buy a used car from this man with minor intricacies like those director john avildsen captures many of the subtle but ever present hints of how life was four decades ago  todays viewing was only the second time ive seen the movie and i have to admit i dont remember susan sarandon in one of the lead roles but then again this was her very first picture the scenes of nudity and free love were something actually quite new and bold at the time shocking in fact as film makers began to experiment with their ability to push the envelope of propriety and convention joe took a major leap in that regard particularly since it was a mainstream picture  with the passage of time the thing that impresses me the most about peter boyle was how he overcame the stereotype of joe curran to appear in or star in some of my very favorite pieces of work i mean how do you go from joe to that hilarious rendition of puttin on the ritz in young frankenstein and my absolute favorite episode of xfiles has boyle as clyde bruckman in both a tender and tragic funny and serious portrayal that turns the tables on scully and mulder more than once and as a career capper frank barone has to be one of the funniest characters in the history of television even repeat episodes in syndication are funny as he whenever the elder barone lets loose with one of his observations he is one actor that this viewer sorely misses already,positive,1

first they came for the communists and i didnt speak up because i wasnt a communist then they came for the jews and i didnt speak up because i wasnt a jew then they came for the catholics and i didnt speak up because i was a protestant then they came for me and by that time there was no one left to speak up for me  attributed to rev martin niemoller 1945  when faced with intolerance or injustice the easiest thing to do is nothing  speak up and you risk becoming an object of scorn but when does enough become too much global antisemitic sentiments allowed hitlers genocidal policies to thrive and equal doses of fearmongering and ignorance made it possible for the anticommunist purges of mccarthyism to destroy thousands of peoples lives inaction makes one no less culpable  lawrence newman is a chameleon of a man quiet and nondescript he blends seamlessly with his surroundings lawrence doesnt like to get involved  when he witnesses an attack on a young woman he tells no one and goes about his business his world spirals into chaos when he buys a pair of glasses and is mistaken for one of them lawrences view of the world and its view of him is forever altered   while the subject matter of this film is not new its presentation is definitely unique it is much easier to understand the irrational nature of prejudice when placed within a certain context  lawrence is more concerned with the assumptions that he is jewish than he is with the views of his attackers he believes that if he corrects this oversight that everything will be all right not realizing that logic and prejudice never go hand in hand   whether playing a schemer the only thing i liked about fargo or a down home nice guy sheriff william h macys roles are linked by a common thread his characters share a subtle deliberate countenance that gives them substance macy nails lawrence down to the smallest detail and says more with a furtive glance or tremble in his voice than a page of dialogue by showing rather than telling lawrence is able to share his fear and bewilderment with the viewer the supporting cast brings the story together  laura dern is compelling as gerty lawrences bombshell wife with a past trailer park rough yet other worldly wise she has also felt the wrath of prejudice as the result of a mistake and unwittingly exacerbates lawrences situation michael lee aday aka meatloaf is frightening as fred the prototypical redneck next door equal parts ignorance and venom rallying neighbours to his virulent cause in the midst of the chaos is finklestein david paymer the focus of the aggression and the voice of reason that raises the important questions paymers even handed portrayal keeps finklestein from becoming a stereotype or someone whose sole purpose is to engender sympathy making his one of the strongest performances in the film  the tight editing and closecropped cinematography make for a clean picture with few distractions and mixes an air of claustrophobia in with the small town usa feel  it is simultaneously comforting and disturbing the deliberate use of harsh twotone lighting to accentuate the malevolent aspects of the piece and the carefully scored soundtrack are powerful without being overwhelming finally the set and costume designs recreate the feel of the era an essential component in the films message  focus unconventional approach in dealing with prejudice is reason enough to recommend this film just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses,positive,1
a lessthansubtle poke at the beliefs and teachings of the catholic church is given a darker shade of death near the end of the show throughout the show dark humour plays a medium through which several commonly heard rhetoric questions are asked especially if god is so good why does he allow evil to exist in the world  diane keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version though some might disagree of they stereotyped religious teacher who spouts the company line and condemns half the world to burn in hell to celebrate her schools 25th anniversary she invites her first students to return and perform their christmas pageant  however when the quartet update their play to parody sister marys fallacious teachings the nun is pushed over the edge sending the story spiralling into a chain of unhappy events the ending finally leaves the audience with a sick feeling in their hearts  not recommended go watch the play instead,negative,0
this movie was chosen quite frankly as a pig in a poke from our local video store it turned out to be quite a pig the plot linesuch as it iswas disjointed inconsistent and predictable the actors constantly looked embarrassed to be mouthing the poorly written lines the only funny moment in the entire film revolved around the dangers of smoking and the inadvertant deployment of an airbag the remainder of the film lacked the punch to amuse either of my young daughters aged less than ten years myself my wife my motherinlaw or even the cat or the dog my advice if you are tempted to borrow this turkey is to save your money and your time look for something else,negative,0
very dull show whats worse its very racist the white guys are dumb idiots and the only romance is between a black guy and a white woman there is nothing interesting about this romance it is not exciting it is not fun they dont even seem to care for each other at all its more like the writers and directors wanted an interracial thing going on why this is so popular in media today it is social programming and will lead to no good there is always tension when too many people want the same thing this show is not worth the 20 bucks for the season its a waste of time and harmful to society at least when they use tv shows to sell products they are more discreet selling whatever agenda here is quite obvious and without clear thinking some may feel wrong to oppose it but some of us know better,negative,0
this is a movie with a wonderful concept but very weak writing it should never have been released with out at least three more rewrites assuming it got any the story is too loosly held together and there are too many 90 degree turns in the story to make it a cohesive movie it would be great to see what a decent screenwriter could do with the story,negative,0

typically spanish production  slowmoving but with great sensuousness and sexuality oozing from the lead actress paz vega watch her in spanglish great sets lots of colour  you get to see cordoba seville spanish mountains and countryside the plot tends to meander here and there but if you follow closely i managed to even though the film is in spanish youll get the gist of it  its about how one very highly sensual young gypsy woman carmen uses her feminine wiles to seduce men to do her bidding carmen is being taken to prison after attacking a fellow cigarera at the cigar factory where she works she persuades jose the soldier in charge of taking her to prison to let her escape jose succumbs to her charms because she speaks basque he is navarrese and speaks the same language jose is punished by 1 month in jail and demoted to foot soldier he later meets carmen at a party and they end up becoming lovers but carmen refuses to commit to him and continues her lascivious and flirty lifestyle in a jealous rage jose kills a fellow soldier who has been with carmen they then have to leave town life on the run turns jose into a bandit carmen meanwhile remains the same a wildly promiscuous woman in the end jose loses his mind and ends up killing carmen  the story is told by jose in prison awaiting to be executed the person he tells the story to is prospero merrime a french writer and anthropologist whose fancy watch it plays beethovens fur elise was stolen by either carmen or jose  worth watching for the sets and for the delectable paz vega,positive,1
james j corbetts autobiography the roar of the crowd was the starting point of this lively and wellremembered fictionalized biography the author was heavyweight champion of the world succeeding john l sullivan before the turn of the century the events of the narrative depict corbett as a brash but likable and intelligent young man whose conquest of the world of boxing and social prejudice in his time when he was considered merely the son of irish immigrants a lowly bank teller and a nobody surprised everyone it took him several hours of exciting and often amusing screentime to prove his compeers were wrong he is an bank teller when the film opens but he somehow wangles an invitation to a sporting club for the welltodo he falls in love with a beautiful but snobbish girl with whom he always seems to be quarreling and he lives at home with a brawling clan of corbetts who seem to fight with one another as often as with others when he defeats the clubs best and a professional fighter borough in to embarrass him he finally decides to become famous by fighting he sets out on the road with his friend who acts as manager and trainer and despite a few near setbacks he wins all his bouts and attracts attention coming home to pursue his girl again he contrives to annoy the boston strongboy mighty john l sullivan who enters bars and claims he can lick any man in the world few believe he can win a bout against sullivan but corbett dubbed gentleman jim for his gracious manners and patrician appearance surprises everyone by moving dancing out of range and negating the furious sullivans power the films finest scene perhaps comes when a beaten sullivan comes to congratulate corbett the new champion rises to the moment tells sullivan a few years before it might have been different and shows him nothing but admiration and respect he gets his girl as a result of his two performances but by the end of the film as they visit his s parents his manager is able to tell the world the corbetts are at it again the films is attractive and has a consistent style without being flashy the script was written by veteran horace mccoy and vincent lawrence from the corbett novel sidney hickox did the cinematography with period set decorations by clarence steensen and art direction by ted smith heinz roemheld did the music and milo anderson the gowns the film was ably directed by actionfilm specialist raoul walsh flynn also liked working with walsh but did not care for the other director he worked for most often michael curtiz among the castwere ward bond as john l sullivan in one of his best performances lovely alexis smith a bit spotty but intelligent as the girl corbett loves and a very able errol flynn as corbett a young man he seemed to relish playinghe later said it was his favorite role from the periodjack carson was his manager alan hale his charismatic father john loder a rich foe with william frawley minor watson madeleine lebeau rhys williams arthur shields dorothy vaughn and mike mazurki along for the enjoyable proceedings it is hard to say enough about the logic and lighthearted fun this movies makers have generated it is one of the bestliked of all sports biography films and by my standards one of the most enjoyable as well,positive,1
basically this is a very good film it is very different from seagals other films though which unfortunately may turn off some of his fans unlike some of the other films this does not feel like a seagal vehicle you get to see plenty of the other characters as well and all of mr seagals actions are not the same as weve seen before the concept of him being an intellectual in something other than bombs and other weaponry is a nice change although there are some unrealistic parts to the film some more obvious than others in general you can let them slide since the film is fun to watch  it boils down to this if you are looking for a classic seagal action film sorry but youre going to be disappointed watch it anyway for the fun of it if youre open to seeing seagal without the action its well worth a look i personally believe it is some of the best work hes done in quite a while  ,positive,1
this is slightly less sickening than the first two films but otherwise its business as usual a scuzzy sleazy and unbalanced slice of diseased cinema charles bronson is back blasting into action when his friend is killed by yobs terrorising the neighbourhood crime you see is up 11 in the south belmont area so whats to be done a stronger police presence tougher jails harsher sentences nope the only solution is to send in a loose cannon like bronson to mete out bloodthirsty revenge  or as the writers would have it justice this time hes the personal killing machine of police chief ed lauter  the writers bend over backwards to make kersey the hero sending the useless cops into the area only to confiscate a weapon from an elderly resident who keeps it for protection and supplying a scene in which kersey has his camera stolen and shoots the thief right in the back to applause from the watching crowd capital punishment for theft well okay the attitude of everyone in the film is that this is a solution and the dishonest twisting of the characters into ciphers who exist only to cheer kersey on or back him up is appalling  sure these villains are scum but shouldnt the film leave the audience to make up its mind rather than slanting the entire thing towards kersey and his mindless answer funnily enough the beleaguered residents dont fear gang reprisals or blame kersey for any of the violence which is odd as one character is killed precisely because of kerseys involvement at the end of the film they all take guns from their sock drawers and gleefully join in with the massacre never stopping to think things through or struggle with the thought of having to kill another human being  the atrociously shallow performances dont help  bronson has literally one facial expression throughout and cant even put inflection on the right words new heights of stupidity are reached here  a machine gun a rocket launcher  and new lows of misogyny the movie contrives to desecrate every female character in sight whether by rape explosion or throatslashing and it sets them up in supremely stupid fashion like one victim who ventures into the crimeridden gangcontrolled neighbourhood to ask out a stranger or another who goes shopping alone at night this is dreck pure and simple mindless garbage put together without style or sense,negative,0
its a very good movie not only for the fans of lady death comics but also for those who like animated moviesseries of adventure and fantasy  the film is about a innocent girl who is about killed for something she hadnt done but for be who she is daughter of the ruler of hell lucifer himself  then she seeks revengeand the rest you better see it from the movie  i liked the movie a lot the characters are like the original comics form chaos i never had the chance of read the the first parts of the story in comics only the last ones after the passages in the movie so i cannot tell you if the events are exactly like the comics butone way or another its the story of lady death,positive,1
im working my way through the horror classics 50 movie pack collection and revolt of the zombies is one of the movies in the set i am watching them with my soontobe sevenyear old daughter which makes most of these movies a laugh riot  i had high hopes for revolt of the zombies after watching white zombie which is really the precursor to so much that is the mainstay of zombies in cinema think clive barkers serpent and the rainbow and james bonds live and let die funeral scene not night of the living dead  however even though the title includes the word zombies it is little more than a love triangle involving anthropologist armand louque who is smitten with claire duval who in turn is taken with his companion clifford grayson what a yawnfest my daughter fell asleep halfway through  i had a real hard time deciphering who these people worked for  the allies or the axis but i guess that doesnt really matter  i was shocked to see bela lugosi in the credits for this movie but of course those were his eyes from white zombie serving as the mindcontrol device for the zombies,negative,0
spacecamp is my favorite movie it is a great story and also inspires others  the acting was excellent and my wife and i went to see lea thompson in cabaret years later due to her performance in the movie it is unfortunate that the challenger accident delayed and hurt the movie  the 20th anniversary of the challenger accident is coming up i knew one of the challenger astronauts off and on since childhood on the carnegie mellon campus where my father went to school i also know a close friend of the late pilot  i was the technical review last year for national bsa for the boy scout astronomy merit badge and i still find spacecamp a great movie to recommend to scouts doing the space related merit badges i teach  i ran into the late astronaut again as an adult and was following a schedule of engineering education we had put together when challenger blew up i wound up sitting in with willard rockwell and his engineersinvisible going over things after the accident at the astrotech stockholders meeting by chance as a result so im much closer to the accident and any movie similarities i made sure that i was a good student and finished the degree four years later strangely enough on the recommendation of the rockwell engineer who told them not to fly challenger in 1986 and who later built endeavour,positive,1

well this is an ivan reitman film with the rare exception ivan likes to entertain his films generally arent deep but they are often entertaining enough my super exgirlfriend surprised me in that i laughed more than i thought i would uma thurman is just so grand and i love her portrayals i like luke wilson too and rainn wilson was a straight hoot never taking itself seriously the film is over the top and yet isnt very unique nor does it go where no one has gone before its a nice rent though and probably an ok date movie especially if you have a headache and dont want to strain your brain its escapist fun and theres nothing wrong with that when you strip away the supergirl stuff youre left with a story about relationships and relationships gone bad its a boy meets girl boy leaves girl thing and in the end the characters are looking for love not all of them take being dumped as well as they coulda slice of life with a twist,positive,1
from the late teens to the 1920s stan laurel was a solo act in films during this time period laurel was definitely not among the upper echelons of talent and his humor isnt nearly as good as contemporaries such as lloyd or keaton however for secondtier short comedies he did create a decent niche as far as the quality of the films go they varied wildly some such as dr pyckle and mr pryde were terrific whereas most were of average to below average in quality  frozen hearts is an odd film like many of the films he made for hal roach and distributed by pathé during this period the costumes were absolutely firstrate and the film looked very nice however despite this and having support from the likes of james finlayson one thing they forgot to include in this film was humor none of the jokes seem to work and the film looks almost like a drama not a comedy only the really silly intertitle cards betray the type film its supposed to be  my advice is try to see all his laurel and hardy films and then see the solo films in addition to dr pyckle try seeing the soilers and mud and sandtwo of his more tolerable solo shorts,negative,0
spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning but sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty nobody should love that  lucius shepard  the color purple takes place in the deep south during the early 1900s and tells the story of celie and nettie two african american sisters the film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather this motif  innocence interrupted by men  permeates the entire film  the film then launches into a series of short sequences celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather gives birth in a dirty barn has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named albert johnson a violent oaf who rapes her repeatedly forcing her to cook clean and look after his children  all these horrific scenes are given little screen time and are instead surrounded by moments of pixiedust cinematography a meddlesome symphonic score incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work the cumulative effect is like the merging of a disney cartoon and a rape movie a jarring aesthetic which caused stanley kubrick to remark that the color purple made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes ten minutes he lasted a long time  the film is often said to deal which racism sexism and black culture but this is not true alice walker the author of the novel upon which the film is based claims to be a bisexual but is actually a closet lesbian her book is a lesbian fantasy a story of female liberation and selfdiscovery which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women for walker the only way out of this maze is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian utopia black sisterhood and female independence celebrated  spielbergs film however reframes walkers story through the lens of comforting american mythologies this is a film in which the salvific power of christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men a film in which albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations moments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool a film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows the cast comprised of lecherous men always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins stereotypical fat mammies jazz bands and gospel choirs   this is a film in which black people are naturally childlike readily and happily accepting their social conditions a film in which black people are oversexed carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions a film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible albert lives in a huge house and black men are completely inept this is not the old south this is the old south as derived from gone with the wind mgm muscals song of the south warner cartoons halleluha and banned disney movies in other words its the south as seen by a child raised on 50s tv its all so cartoonish so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes that black novelist ishmael reed famously likened it to a nazi conspiracy  of course in typical spielberg fashion the film ends with family bonds being healed this reconciliation was in walkers novel but spielberg goes further by having every character in the story reconcile with their kin  beyond walkers hate letter to black men and spielbergs bizarre caricaturing of black life we are shown nothing of the black community we have only the vaguest ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and no insight into how they interact with others in their community instead spielbergs camera jumps about desperately fighting for our attention one of celies kitchen contraptions seems like it belongs in a home alone movie every emotion over played the director never stopping to just observe something or to allow a little bit of life to simply pass by couple this with quincy jones ridiculously white music and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history an angry feminist tract filmed by a white jew in the style of disney and griffith scored by a black man trying to emulate john williams  problematic too is the lack of white characters consider this the men in this film arent portrayed as being rough to each other nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which reduces their manhood no they are cruel by nature and the women whether quietly suffering like celie or rebellious and tough like her sister persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them a better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressed rather it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles and that african american domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factors women unable to support themselves and their children alone  and so theres a hidden ideology at work here late in the film one character tells another that since he didnt respect his wife she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites the implication is that blacks need to return to their african roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them ie respect one another in your poor minority community and you wont run afoul of the dominant white culture   310  a failure to confront sex and lesbianism inappropriate musical numbers countless sequence loaded with extraneous visual pizazz incongruous comic business emphatic music cues and wildly hyped emotionality all contribute to rendering the color purple worthless,negative,0
this was a great book and the possibilities for a truly great film were definitely there but the casting decisions completely wrecked the movie hanks is a great actor to be sure but lacks the smarmy morally ambivalent characteristics needed for the lead role jeff daniels would have been my choice  putting melanie griffiths in for eye candy reasons is understandable but again she did not portray the depth or ambivalence so need to pull this off  this movie is a great example of how every decision even those early on in the movie production can make or break a file,negative,0
the thought of sarah silverman having her own show worried me at first the films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off however i was very surprised to see her true colors shine in this comedy central gem i could possibly put her on par with the likes of amy sedaris in strangers with candy  sarahs character is a true sociopath very comparable to sedaris jerri blank  the one downfall of this show is its supporting cast her sisters character is good funny at times but ultimately meant not to steal sarahs show however the rest of the cast is extremely subpar in comparison  im glad though that comedy central has given sarah a chance to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor,positive,1
i have zero interest rap and in ghetto culture im white and like classic rock however that did not stop me from appreciating this fantastic comedy its pretty much a sequel of this is spinal tap in the sense that it is the same movie just about rap instead or rock yet its hilarious there are many funny jokes but not without a few jokes that just fall flat the characters are all very funny and believable i watched just because it made me laugh at 3 am and any movie that can do that warrants at least a test screening one of the reasons why this movies was so funny was that it makes fun of rap from a different rap today is concerned with the wrong things and get by with studio noise and little talent this movie comes from a time where rappers deserved more credit overall its a funny movie with many jokes about racism sex and music culture among the more obvious themes of humor this is highly recommend for any fan of this is spinal tap they are essentially the same movie just about different worlds and yes the same jokes work in both movies,positive,1
when this series aired i watched most of it i think it was supposed to be a long running series in the vein of the fugitive and the incredible hulk where the protagonist is being chased around the country looking for a solution to his problems in this case the heros problem is his progressive aging in reverse i liked what i saw of these shows the acting was good especially the sorrowful relationship between the lead character and his wife problem is they cancelled it before it had a chance to end either that or i missed the last episodes  they never got a chance to wrap up the story either knowing it had been cancelled poof it was just gone however like i said before i might have missed the last episodes but my proof to the contrary is this i rented the tape where i left off in the series the lead characters wife dies in a fire started by a chase involving kings famous organization the shop while getting away hero is kidnapped it ends with his friends realizing they have to go save him from the shop the end last episode on the video his wife does not die but escapes the fire with him right when he should get nabbed by the shop he and his wife share a weird moment then phase out of existence abrupt silly and cheap to the extreme they just wanted to put this video out and decided to tag on an ending not caring how bad it was they might as well of just shown some stock footage of the first atomic bomb detonations almost pythonesque  the show did have a cool opening title sequence set to the david bowie song of the same name,negative,0
ive noticed over the years that when a rock star makes his final album before his death that album if its not his best is usually prolific in some way and worthy of a listen at least the album is usually good enough to cement a legacy however when it comes to comedians especially mainstream comics who star in their own vehicles their final movie is usually god awful john belushi had neighbors john candy had wagons east chris farley had almost heroes phil hartman had small soldiers and rodney dangerfield had this movie  back by midnight although it may not have been dangerfields very last film is weak in every sense of the word it wrapped filming in 2002 according to this website and its safe to say that it would have stayed on the shelves if dangerfield was still alive i have been a big fan of dangerfields since i was in my early teens and it pains me to see how rotten this film was  what amazes me the most is that a number of other talented people took part in a movie with a very weak premise to begin with dangerfield a great comedian who usually played his comic persona on film is a prison warden who houses a close knit group of inmates when the owner of the prison coloneltomparkermeetssamwalton billionaire eli rockwood randy quaid cuts funding for the prison the warden sends a group of inmates to break out of prison rob rockwoods eponymous convenience stores of consumer goods and break back into prison with the loot by taking whats in the convenience stores they are i guess taking what they believe rockwood owes them  with this flimsy premise the movie sputters and stalls frequently on top of that the jokes that you think would be this movies salvation are not even close to funny not even from mr no respect himself that is incredibly disappointing too because youd expect a movie with oscarnominated  randy quaid kirstie alley gilbert gottfried ed begley jr yeardley smith and others to be at least a little bit funny instead quaid plays a character weve seen before in countless other comedies alley plays a british heiress with an awful british accent could this movie not afford an actual british person and every joke was poorly set up and poorly timed by virtually every member of this ensemble it was just not a good comedy in any sense of the word  back by midnight was rated r mainly for language and one scene of nudity the irony in this fact is that many of the jokes are so audience insulting that even kids if you edit out the language would walk out of this film the physical gags are also incredibly predictable especially when alleys pet monkey torments quaids character when the monkey grabs a pair of scissors and jumps on quaids couch who wouldnt know where that gag was going  being a directtovideo comedy of course i didnt expect any oscarwinning material on here the truth is though dangerfield has made some great timeless comedies before easy money and back to school are hilarious still and were definitely not oscarworthy in the slightest however theres a difference between making a dumb comedy thats funny and making a dumb comedy with the latter kind of comedy it seems like the filmmakers dont even try which is precisely the case with this lame excuse for a wasted 90 minutes rest in peace rodney but add this film to your batch of forgettable comedies like meet wally sparks 1997 and the godson 1999 this film dare i say it is not even worth seeing,negative,0
this ambitious film suffers most from writerdirector paul thomas andersons delusions of grandeur highly derivative of much better material altmans nashville lumets network this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere a couple of misguided detours along the way an embarrassing musical interlude a biblical plague dont help matters neither does the uneven level of performances especially bad william h macy whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether julianne moore for her unconvincing angst and how many times must we see john c reillys sad sack shtick chicago and the hours will suffice tom cruise comes off well by comparison  his misogynist foulmouthed holy roller was rather amusing speaking of foul mouths the script was so loaded with f bombs they lost their impact in no time dont even talk about that awful soundtrack full of insipid and annoying vocals by aimee mann her extended rendition of one a maudlin number to begin with drove me to distraction at the start of the film i should have heeded the handwriting on the wall and saved myself three more hours by which time id been pushed to the brink of hell one redeeming feature which i havent seen mentioned in other reviews is the best performance in the bunch by unknown melora walters in the role of claudia the damaged coke fiend bent on selfdestruction her credibility exceeded all others by far this film took itself way too seriously and just didnt know when to end,negative,0

i was thinking that the main character the astronaut with the bad case of the runsin his case his skin hair muscles etc could always get more movie work after hed been reduced to a puddle all he has to do is get a job as the blob the premise of this flick is pretty lame an astronaut gets exposed to sunspot radiationi think and so begins to act like an ice cream cone on a hot day not only is this a puzzler but apparently he has to kill humans and consume their flesh so that he can maintain some kind of cell integrity huh have you ever noticed that whenever any kind of radiation accident or experiment happens the person instantly turns into a killing machine why is that  the astronaut lumbers off into the night from the secret facilitywhich has no security whatsoever shedding parts of himself as he goes apparently he retains just enough memory to make him head for the launch pad maybe because he wanted to return to space   thus begins the part of the movie thats pretty much filler with a doctor wandering around with a geiger counter trying to find the melting man by the buzz he gives off he kills a stupid bill gates lookalike fisherman scares a little girl a la the frankenstein monster movie and finishes off a wacky older couplepunishing them karmically for stealing some lemons then theres a short scene where he whacks his former general and a very long scene where he kills a young pothead and chases his girlfriend around youd think that after she cuts his arm off and he run away the scene would shift but nowere treated to about ten minutes of the woman huddled into a corner panting and screaming in terror even though the monster is gone all i could think wasdirectors girlfriend anyone  the end of the movie is even lamer than the rest of it the melting man finishes turning into a pile of goo and thennothing thats it thats the end of the movie well at least that meant that there was no room for a sequel,negative,0

hayao miyazaki name became prominent with spitied away however what is often overlooked are directors first film efforts who remembers that spielberg directed duel or george lucas directed thx 1138 i remember seeing fragments of this movie  almost certainly the last 45 minutes in late 80s and what stuck with me was the visual lushness of the design and animation so when i found a copy in a well known store for £9 i couldnt resist but buy it the odd thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not tally with my memory of it memory is funny that way  viewing this movie now with all the gained knowledge of artists portfolios is how very like jean moebius giraud some of the artwork is i can only assume some influence here  when pazu catches a falling girl sheeta his adventure really begins  the quest for laputa  a reference to jonathan swifts overlooked portion of gullivers travels with healthy references to jules verne its a basic good vs bad chase movie with the final portion having the heroes end up on laputa  this is the portion that is strongest in my memory  the pastoral ecological aspect of laputa returned to nature  the multitude of robots covered in moss beneath the giant tree this is in my opinion the highlight of the movie  the views of the surface of laputa as opposed to the mechanised underground  although this is the dichotomy of this movie  to show that even technology cannot overcome nature  the irony of the last robot tending the garden and animals the ending of the movie silent running is almost exactly the same  it is incredibly stylish i would not say slick  very beautiful and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in the buildings airships and the design and look of just about everything  myazaki is a true master of this kind of japnanese anime buy this movie and treasure it,positive,1
as an antifootball person i on the surface grudgingly took my younger brother to see this film although secretly i hoped it might be east is east ii the trailers looked fun so i thought id give it a go  it took about ten minutes but after that i was glued to the screen and that wasnt anything to do with the neck cramp caused by sitting too near the front due to a packed auditorium the acting was fresh and vibrant the characters engaging and the jokes genuinely funny the entire auditorium was laughing out loud every minute or so football fan or no football fan sport became irrelevant to the main principles of love friendship family independence and rivalry add a dash of sikh culture and you have the formula for the best british comedy ive seen in a long time dare i say it better than east is east  this film trots along nicely at a lovely pace never dwelling on anything longer than necessary nor leaving anything unfinished keeping the viewer entertained and mentally engaged though not a characteristically twistingandturning film there are some pleasant surprises on the way and things dont always happen as you would expect  saying that there were elements of predictability but these were exploited satirically more than used as scriptfillers i suppose depending on your particular penchant for happyendings you could be either delightedlet down by the ending personally if there was any other outcome i would have written a strongly worded letter to the script writers  as for the actors i would have to say that juliet stevenson paula put in the finest performance i never knew that people like that existed but she her realism with sometimes bizarre concepts has convinced me that they possibly do prize for the most unconvincing of the main characters goes unfortunately to kiera knightley jules but dont get me wrong even she offered a great performance its just that someone has to be last of the best and sorry kiera this time youre it  tip dont leave before the credits once the lights came back up i realised to my horror that perhaps i shouldnt have watched this film after all my beloved but forgotten ice junkie had melted into a sugary blue juice oh what am i saying it was absolutely brill and i cant recommend it enough i will definitely buy it when it comes out and add it to my collection of 3 videos im a student i only splash out if its really worth it,positive,1

i have seen the perfect son about three times i fail to see how this film is a gay film i am not even gay but i dont see it as a gay film it is a film with a gay character i cant see why every film with a gay character should be strictly a film about being gay i find the film to be sympathetic to the study of death the death of someone who is your kin i think theo turns his life around fairly quickly after rehab because he wants to and watching his brother dying in front of him makes him reassess his life i found the dialog in the scene when theo tells ryan he is going to be a father to be very moving ryan states that he doesnt want to know about the things he is never going to see or share with anyone isnt that horrific and sad i highly recommend the film,positive,1
this movie was really well written and was very entertainingthere was great acting in it too luke perry did a very convincing job like he always doesif you are looking for a eventful movie to watch this should be at the top of your list there is a mixture of comedy drama and action you can literally feel what the actors are feeling at points i was very impressed by this movie the special effects were very well done the whole movie was very convincing this movie is one of my favorites what happens is north america could be torn apart and jack and his team have to try and to stop an eruption by destroying north america it was a very cool and creative idea i loved this movie and i know you will too,positive,1
two wildlife photographers are traveling through the amazon river basin on their latest assignment while trying to capture the wildlife of the area on film our photographers cross paths with a game hunter who is stalking the animals for another reason looking to eliminate the witnesses to his illegal activities the hunter decides to according to the dvd sleeves synopsis   handsome guide peter brown as jim pendrake takes pretty blonde ahna capri as terry greene and her goodlooking brother tom simcox as art greene into the venezuelan jungle to admire the view and take wildlife pictures after they hook up with hunky biggame hunter william smith as caribe psychological dramatics surface   a pivotal scene with mr brown reposing in the vee of a tree and sharing a cigarette with mr simcox is nicely staged the circular direction reappears in the later fight between brown and mr smith and it is effective simcox early sex romp adds nothing to the story it could have been cut to take advantage of what seems like flirting between the brown and simcox characters an attraction between brown and ms capri could have been played up also   the music including jim steins love all things that love the sun is fine but the film needs to be retracked to cut out animals which do not appear on screen and there is far too much superfluous footage on display piranha is a case where less would have been more,negative,0
four friends is one of those films that you go to without any expectations only to find yourself knocked for a loop you sort of file it away but then you hear the song georgia on my mind by ray charles and images and vague feelings begin to flicker on the edge of your consciousness and then you remember this crazy film which made you laugh and cry almost at the same time  why is this film so memorable first at least for people who lived through it all because it captures so well the tenor of the times  its dashed hopes its successes its sincerity and above all the emotional rollercoaster ride that leads to a poignant nostalgia and then the acting is just so amazing danilow all angst and passion georgia as difficult to grasp as a will o the wisp but enchanting nevertheless and louis the handicapped roommate with charm to spare who attacks life with gusto and takes each moment with a wry smile because he knows only too well that it just might be his last  how long has it been since you saw a film that made you really care about the people in the story even if they were far from perfect the film presents you with people whose choices are not necessarily commendable but the film never moralizes it just allows us to appreciate the human condition in all its variety even the minor characters have a welldefined personality and a history which is why this film seems so real even when some of the actions and reactions might seem over the top because thats the way life is when you think about it and why this film engages you with a complexity that is defined by character truly an amazing and satisfying experience,positive,1
after a love triangle story in har dil jo pyaar karega these 3 stars were again chosen in this controversial flick the film would have been considered as hit if there was not a controversy with the production values from bharat shah here director duo abbasmustan did a very different and unique job as compared with their previous and after directorial ventures they are considered as thriller makers of bollywood but in this cccc they proved that they can equally handle to make a romantic family drama hardly there is a single action scene when preity was being raped by salmans colleague in her apartment salman slapped him  the movie has almost all the standards and ingredients like song story casting performances etc which are required to make a movie hit but of course for salmans fan this was something a surprise gift from him why because for so long he has been doing roles where he has a scene to show his open body and dance lalala all around his role as a rich young businessman who has nononsense nature and of normal attitude is really impressive after all madhubala a prostitute role performed by preity is amazing later when she too turns out thoughtful about her life she deserve proper attention her facial expressions and body language become more attractive and focus mainly goes to her her previous role as a pregnant woman in kya kehna was not that hearttouching as it is here of course this can be termed as improvement then priya a very innocent and helpless wife of raj who only depends on him for a better result she has nothing powerful influence in the story as the main ingredients are in the hands of preity  finally the main point of the story which is something rare and unique in itself in real world of this age it is not totally impossible to happen such step of searching for a surrogate mother perhaps many are happening in this large world where these are kept secret and in this way the scriptwriter of cccc has uncovered a hidden truth which is taking place in others daily lives but still then it is a doubt,positive,1
a strange role for eddie murphy to take at the height of his career while there is a lot of the eddie murphy character he plays a truly decent person the rest of the cast is good particularly the lovely charlotte lewis her characters beauty and serenity held the tone of the film from getting to be too much murphy,positive,1
im not sure this film could ever match the first one even if it starred the original seven notwithstanding the fact that four were killed it just doesnt have the spark and chemistry all the actors seem tired and look as if they are just going through the motions to get their paychecks  its interesting how yul brynner is magnificent in the original film but stiff and unconvincing in this sequel yet when he stars in westworld and futureworld in the 1970s his character in the same matching black pants shirt and hat evokes the same mystery and presence of the 1960 films chris adams  theres nothing in this 1966 flick to make it worth watching even on cable,negative,0
i dont have words to describe how good this movie is only a genius like amrita pritam could have written such a real depiction of the days of partition the movie kept haunting me for many days  urmila did the role of her life in this movie she put life in the role of puroo and manoj vajpai did no less in his role as rashid it is hard to imagine anyone other than these two doing the role of puroo and rashid the punjabi costumes looked so natural on urmila and manoj looked like a natural punjabi mussalmaan  sandhali sinha as lajjo and suri as ramchand did fabulous job priyanshu chattarjee did good work as triloki  some of the scenes you just cant get out of your mind when puroo meets lajjo for the first time it brings tears to your eyes the climax is just killer i was expecting a tragic ending but thankfully the ending was wonderful  this movie is in the same category as pakeezah mughaleazam banaras etc not to be missed,positive,1
i personally found the film to be great i had it on preorder for a month and watched it twice the day i got it in the mail and several time since yes the time lapses may be a bit much but the rest of the movie clearly compensates for it all amature cast yet the acting was right on for each part the plot itself is just haggard theres no other way to describe it who makes a movie about someone getting fgered bam thats who genius simply genius two thumbs up i would be honored to work with him any day any time on any thing,positive,1
first saw this movie in about 1990 and absolutely died laughing through it it became a cult favorite with my circle of friends and wed quote from it at the drop of a hat im going home in a bag needless to say the humor is still there 15 years later its become a tradition at halloween time to expose many of my new friends to this film good thing you can still buy it off ebay ive found that halloween candy tastes much better with your tongue planted firmly in your cheekand this movie provides it all pathos suspense unrequited lovenobility and the list goes on royal dano provides an amazing heartfelt performance as old man wrenchmuller i remember seeing him in the 7 faces of dr lao as a bad guy who met a bad end here you really feel for the old guy right from the beginning   if you arent careful youll miss some of the levels of humor in this movie the creators got real subtle in many ways with offhand comments little subtle costume digs at other scifi movies and even a scene ripped from the pages of wile e coyote  dont spend too much thought processes trying to analyze a movie people this is fun fare without the need for nitpicking and shouldnt be offensive to anyone well maybe stupid people but they wont know theyre being mocked  now if youll excuse me im gonna go get a zagnut bar  ramsay rc cowlishaw karaoke djentertainer,positive,1
a recent post here by a woman claiming a military background contained the comment a womans life is no more valuable than a mans  this mantra of the politically correct is not true as history as well as biology show societies have managed to recover from heavy losses of their male population sometimes with astonishing speed germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the 1914 1918 war in which over two million of her men were killed in south americas war of the triple alliance 1865 paraguay took on three neighboring countries until virtually her entire male population was wiped out but fought to a stalemate in the 1932 chaco war against much larger bolivia  no society however has or ever could survive the loss of its female population only when the very life of the nation is at stake are women sent to fight israel faced that situation in 1948 but since then has never considered coed combat units for its defense forces despite the popular image of the israeli girl soldier  gi jane is hollywood fluff,negative,0
oliver the musical is a favorite of mine the music the characters the story it all just seems perfect in this rendition of the timeless classic novel turned stage musical director carol reed brings the broadway hit to life on the movie screen  the transition from musical to movie musical is not an easy one you have to have the right voices the right set the right script and the right play all signs point to yes for this play it almost appears that it was written for the screen  our story takes place in jolly old england where a boy named oliver manages to work his way out of the orphanage he winds his way through the country to london where he meets up with a group of juvenile delinquents headed by dodger the smart talking quick handed pickpocket the leader of this gang is named fagin an older fellow who sells all the stolen goods  but all is not well in london town when bill sykes played by oliver reed and his loving girlfriend nancy get tangled up with oliver fagin and his young troops and the law what ensues is a marvelous tale of love affection and great musical numbers  whether or not you like musicals or not one listen to these tunes and you will be humming them all day long oliver is a triumph on and off the stage and is a timeless work of art,positive,1
see three colors blue and three colors white they are both wonderful films and will give an added dimension to the finale three colors red red is a fantastic film it can be enjoyed in a single viewing and indeed the climax of the film is very powerful in that first viewing but watch it again once you understand the use of symbolism and character parallels in this movie you will see new things with each viewing with the first viewing you understand that the film is the work of a brilliant mind with each additional viewing you find yourself discovering that it is in fact a work of genius red is meant to symbolize fraternity in the french flag the story turns the theme of fraternity around to be viewed at angles one would never suspect the facets of fraternity shared by the different characters is as deep as you care to peer if you are used to the blatant symbolism in most mass films you may find red a bit slow you may find yourself looking at a screen filled with intensity that you do not fathom and yawning wonder what all the excitement is about this is not a mindless vicarious experience everything is not explained to you you must think as you watch you must see not simply look wonderful movie one meant to be enjoyed by a wonderful moviegoer,positive,1
gods i havent watched a movie this awful in a long while maybe not since the new guy or various freddie prinze jr movies yes it is that astoundingly awful mira sorvinos blank and wooden acting surely mustve been inspired by freddie the movie staging was awkward like a play rather and that feeling of confinement does not work well on film the actors had no idea what they were doing especially sorvino her accent was awful and her sex appeal nonexistent here so it was painful to see her seducing other characters and they falling for it and what was with the occaisional shots of a live audience in lawn chairs nonsensical i had to turn the dvd player off it would have been selfinflicted pain to finish this film,negative,0
no artful writeup here because it doesnt deserve one not an art film not even one of those hidden gems you know like those movies you hear about through a friend who saw this amazing movie downtown where they show all the good independents and art films  just pack it into the christmas boxes and dispose of quickly,negative,0
it is a tricky thing to play a queen on the one hand the actress has to be majestic and imperious and on the other she has to show vulnerability in a tough situation as well as the gathering of the courage and resolution to overcome the odds since almost all movies about queens have that basic plot line   emily blunt is quite radiant as victoria but its not as full a performance as id like no blame to her i cant help but feel like this is a mills  boon novel adaptation compared to a darker more dramatic movie about another young queen elizabeth hence blunt doesnt get to run the gamut of queenly emotions at least not to the full extent since shes yknow the young victoria to see the old victoria check out mrs brown  jeanmarc vallee is an interesting choice of director for the movie he last did crazy which was excellent and propelled him to fame it was quite a different movie but i remember it looking gorgeous and thats probably the main similarity between the two movies but while vallee wrote crazy this one was by julian fellowes and though i really enjoyed his gosford park the story for this movie was much less interesting i soon got lost with all the governmental politics maybe it was less engaging because there was no potential beheading of the monarchy im just saying,positive,1
excellent writing and wild cast the tech is poor but its obviously very low budget looks like they didnt cut the negative but had to release on a video output in any case one of the most inventive comedies ive seen lately the screenwriter in particular is fine,positive,1
there are bad movies and then there are movies which are even worst saw is just that  the movie is simply bad on all points the plot the acting the camera work the music and everything else is absolutely terrible and i cannot begin to comprehend how such trash made it to the big screen  the simple fact is that saw is riddled with plot holes the beginning is enticing and leaves much to be expected but it does not hold up and the plot becomes absolutely ridiculous and absurd the film is not creative and will not leave you with a single bit of credibility people that claim that this movie is gory violent sadistic and scary are sissy girls who have nightmares after watching csi because it is far from that  so i am warning you know do not attempt to watch this if you have any form of intellect because you will be disappointed a true bore and a mediocre film as can be,negative,0
eichard gere  diane lane back again in another romantic love story they are an excellent teambut somehow this film will not be among there best   the director george wolfe using a screenplay by ann peacock  john romanao for nicholas sparks novel does a capable job this is yet another tale of 2 strangers meeting  falling in lovethen they go on there waythen when they are about to meet again  start a life together  spoiler but not really tragedy happens one of them dies  how many times have we seen this already  those who never saw tearjerkers like this will hopefully like it more than i did this story has about every cliché there is  the only reason this has the ratings i will give it is because of the fine acting  excellent production  the cast besides our 2 stars includes christopher meloni viola davis  scott glenn they all give real good performances  do the very best with the material they were given  there is a good but not over done storm sequence the sex scenes are well done no nudity  next to no foul language  ratings  out of 4 82 points out of 100 imdb 7 out of 10,positive,1

this 1986 italianfrench remake of the 1946 film of the same name turns up the heat early and doesnt let us come up for air the story is about a highschool student federico pitzalis who cant keep his eyes off the mysteriously beautiful young woman played by dutch phenom maruschka detmers who lives next door to the school one day he follows her and his persistence pays off theres only one problem shes engaged to a sketchy character riccardo de torrebruna who may or may not have committed a heinous crime and if he repents will probably be let off with a slap on the wrist also the young woman is a little funny in the head and this is corroborated when we discover she has been seeing the boys father who is a psychiatrist giulias emotional instability is only equalled by her prodigious sexual desires hot hot hot from the word go with handsome leads and a bombshell performance from detmers who plays us like a yoyo as she does the boy from scene to scene with enough suspense to keep us guessing right up untiland even afterthe end available in r and x  rated versions,positive,1
i really enjoyed this film because i have a tremendous interest in american history the antebellum years and the civil war in particular i purchased it recently from a rack of previouslyviewed videos on sale at the supermarket and i was very glad to add this one to my history video collection though not of the caliber of civil war films such as glory or gettysburg provides a lot of history on the precivil war brotherhood among cadets at west point  maybe its the gray uniforms the youth or the military discipline but i am fascinated by the story of the corps of cadets from around 1830 to the brink of the war i imagine what it must have been like to sit in a classroom with other young men learning how to make war then later putting the lessons to use against your own classmates  actually there were two classes graduated in 1861 one class in may the other in june the movie makes no real mention of this except to mention henry a dupont first graduate of the may class and george custer last grad of the june class the reason for the two classes was not so much about the war but it was the result of switching back to a fouryear course of study after a few years of experimenting with a fiveyear course i think the first class had attended five years the other for four as the movie portrays cadets were like brothers and often had nicknames for each other george fanny or autie custer alonzo lon cushing james beauty stuart for jeb stuart class of 1854 etc  i say this film is santa fe trail as it should have been because that 1940 film while enjoyable really fudges history cadets from several different classes are all graduating together jeb stuart and george custer are portrayed as the best of friends and are sidebyside in stopping john browns 1859 insurrection at harpers ferry in fact stuart and custer were never friends but enemies during the war they faced each other for the first time i think at gettysburg in 1863 stuart was at the harpers ferry raid but custer was still a cadet at the point when it took place  fanny custer plays a role in class of 61 though his classmate chums dev oneill and shelby peyton are fictional i believe they are respectively based on partick henry ororke and john pelham two people you can look up  anyway i truly enjoy this film or any film which provides a window into mid19th century america,positive,1
though the plot elements to the eighth day seem like they have been done plenty of times the film still has much of the spark mystery and symbolism that jaco van dormals first film had though not as good as toto the hero which will always remain on my favorites list the movie still leaves us with lots of emotions daniel auteil from 2001s flavorless the closet downplays his part afraid to overact rightfully so the role could have easily been ruined if the actor was overly dramatic however i felt the part needed a bit more realism to it focusing more on the character itself instead of simply the characters growth  dont walk into this movie expecting the dark humor and unexpected twists that you got from toto the hero because you will be disappointed however the film still serves as a decent if not flawed movie,positive,1
watching marlen brando on screen is like watching a master carpenter chiseling intricate details into a piece of mahogany brandos acting is the only thing that makes this movie watchable the plot is inane and laughable not comic the other big name actors seem to be making desperate attempts to give the characters they portray some modicum of humanity these characters have the humanity of wet cardboard everything about the technical side of this film is either mediocre or just plain awful the director throws freezeframe and slowmotion shots about with impunity the incidental music is cartoonish and destroys any hint of dramatic effect its not something i really look for in a movie but even the wardrobe was way off the venerable brando couldnt take focus away from the awful rags they had him decked out in ive heard this movie called david lynchesquire and irreverently funny it is neither david lynch films are borne of wicked creativity  this film was in no way creative and dont confuse irreverence with stupidity,negative,0

the black castle is one of those films that has found its way into a boris karloff collection and is mistakenly expected to be an outright horror movie whilst some horror elements exist within nathan jurans movie this really is a multi genre piece thats tightly produced and effectively portrayed joining karloff in what is a small but critical role are richard greene stephen mcnally lon chaney jr rita corday john hoyt  michael pate its produced unsurprisingly out of universal international pictures the plot sees greenes english gentleman travel to the castle home of the sinister count von bruno mcnally hes following an investigation into the disappearance of two friends an investigation that is fraught with danger and surprise at every turn  this has everything that fans of the old dark housecastle subgenre could wish for genuine good and bad guys a fair maiden dark corners for doing dark deeds devilish traps ticking clock finale and we even get a good old fashioned bit of swashbuckling into the bargain the cast are all turning in effective performances particularly greene and the wonderfully sneering mcnally whilst jerry sackheims writing is lean and devoid of the pointless filler that has so often bogged down similar films of this ilk a very recommended film on proviso that karloff fans understand its not really a karloff movie and perhaps more importantly that horror fans dont expect blood letting to be the order of the day a fine atmospheric story with a sense of dread throughout the black castle is a fine viewing experience 710,positive,1

does anyone think that this show actually helps some people or does it only anger the people who watch it when i am flipping through the channels and come upon this show i half to watch out of morbid curiosity i understand that pat roberson is not all together what i do not know is if his viewers are like him or if they are good people and think they will have a better life if they listening to what he has to say pat roberson is of little consequence he is an old man who thinks in an old way fear of damnation no longer has the same affects as it once did thank god now if someone will please answer my question i will be dodging lightning bolts for the rest of eternity,negative,0
i was at school in the late sixties and early seventies and this film is very much how my school was the school play where the leading actors kiss that happened at my school a crazy gang of lads my school again only when we went on a cross country run we would have a smoke getting the whack some one at my school broke in through a sky light and broke the canes after that they were kept in a safe and as for certain nocternal activities what can i say the film actually came out in 1982 i remember that as it was when i bought my house and the film was showing at the same time if you like british films and films about school growing up and period pieces then this is for you another film very much like it swalk came out a few years before and i for one would like to see that again also kes is in the genre highly recommended but trust me 1982 is when it came out,positive,1
who doesnt have unresolved issues with parents and which parents dont have unresolved issues with each other  i know that sounds heavy but this is played for laughs in the movie making both the comedy better and the drama better ive always like paul reiser and peter falk and although i was a bit concerned that their star qualities might be too big for a small movie i was enchanted from the very first scene  especially entertaining were the discoveries that the son makes about his father as a person and peter falks monologue about being a hardworking sacrificing father and husband was the perfect balancing point without that scene being acted so well the movie would have seemed far less nuanced and the character far less interesting  nicely done paul and peter,positive,1

hundstage is an intentionally ugly and unnerving study of life in a particularly dreary suburb of vienna it comes from former documentary director ulrich seidl who adopts a very documentarylike approach to the material however the film veers away from normal types and presents us with characters that are best described as extremes  some are extremely lonely some extremely violent some extremely weird some extremely devious some extremely frustrated and misunderstood and so on the film combines several near plot less episodes which intertwine from time to time each following the characters over a couple of days during a sweltering viennese summer very few viewers will come away from the film feeling entertained  the intention is to point up the many things that are wrong with people the many ills that plague our society in general it is a thoughtprovoking film and its conclusions are pretty damning on the whole  a fussy old widower fantasises about his elderly cleaning lady and wants her to perform a striptease for him while wearing his deceased wifes clothes a nightclub dancer contends with the perpetually jealous and violent behaviour of her boyracer boyfriend a couple grieving over their dead daughter can no longer communicate with each other and seek solace by having sex with other people an abusive man mistreats his woman but she forgives him time and again a security salesman desperately tries to find the culprit behind some vandalism on a work site but ends up picking on an innocent scapegoat and a mentally ill woman keeps hitching rides with strangers and insulting them until they throw her out of the car the lives of these disparate characters converge over several days during an intense summer heat wave  the despair in the film is palpable many scenes are characterised by long awkward silences that are twice as effective as a whole passage of dialogue might be then there are other scenes during which the dialogue and onscreen events leave you reeling in particular a scene during which the security salesman leaves the female hitchhiker to the mercy of a vengeful guy  to be beaten raped and humiliated thankfully all offscreen for some vandalism she didnt even do  arouses a sour almost angry taste in another scene a man has a lit candle wedged in his rearend and is forced to sing the national anthem at gunpoint all as part of his punishment for being nasty to his wife while we might want to cheer that this thug is receiving his comeuppance we are simultaneously left appalled and unnerved by the nature of his punishment indeed such stark contrasts could act as a summary of the whole film  every moment of lightheartedness is counterbalanced with a moment of coldness every shred of hope is countered with a sense of despair for every character you could like or feel sympathy for there is another that encourages nothing but anger and hate we might want to turn away from hundstage to dismiss it as an exercise in misery but it also points up some uncomfortable truths and for that it should be applauded,positive,1

here is the explanation screenwriter pamela katz gave me for why mvt introduced jg as a specific character in the film  the historical record is very clear joseph goebbels was directly responsible for the release of the rosenstrasse prisoners so we needed a way to get goebbels himself into our film for a woman like lena a woman from an aristocratic family with connections it wasnt unthinkable that she would make an attempt to go to the top the idea of getting to goebbels wasnt impossible for her so that became our hook  those of you who insist on seeing an actual sex act here can read my new thread below  then fire away  jan lisa huttner films for two,positive,1

a fascinating slice of life documentary about a husband and wife and their marriage told through the eyes of their son we all like to think that our parents lived happy lives that their marriages were full of fulfilment love and happy memories sadly many of us know this not to be the case of their own families and that of their parents this wonderful little documentary is told through the camera lens and emotional perspective of the son of a family that has just experienced the death of their mother the son being a documentary film maker has filmed his elder family for many years for as he states posterity three months after the death of his mother his father remarries his long time secretary the suddenness of this occurrence stuns the family and pushes the son to dig into the past lives of his mother and father what he reveals is a fascinating look into the lives of two rather ordinary people who like so many of their generation married early for the wrong reasons and found themselves stuck in a family life where they found they just had to make do a wife who found herself at times bitterly lonely and unloved and a husband who buries himself in his work she and intellectual at heart he a much simpler individual who seems to find most of his pleasures in the quiet solitude of work they are obviously wrong for each other this much is clear yet they stick it out for what well thats part of the mystery they clearly show affection for each other at times if not ever much love you wont find any truly shocking disclosures here aside from infidelity on both sides which in good part is what makes this such a gem you really feel that these could be your own parents if circumstances were different and indeed makes one question the lives of ones own parents,positive,1

youre in the navy now is painfully bad very likely the worst movie gary cooper ever made its supposedly based on a true story but the incident which inspired this film doesnt seem to have enough plot to sustain a featurelength script  i saw this movie on local television while i was housesitting for my motherinlaw in long island new york there was a raging blizzard outside and i was literally snowbound if id been able to get out the door i definitely would have stopped watching this movie  there are some interesting names in the supporting cast notably charles bronson under his original name lee marvin harvey lembeck jack webb and jack warden forget it everybody stinks in this movie even the usually reliable millard mitchell is awful lee marvin and jack warden are onscreen so briefly theres no point in your watching for them  gary cooper plays an obscure naval officer who is assigned to command a ship which is powered by a new experimental steam turbine basically the whole ship is a giant teakettle cooper realises that the assignment is not a prestigious one if it were it would have gone to a better officer  cooper was a good actor in dramatic roles but he simply had no ability for comedy he made several bad comedies and this one is his worst jane greer has always bored me and she bored me more than usual here this ship went down with all hands and sank without a trace have i mentioned that this movie stinks ill rate youre in the navy now one point out of 10 toot toot,negative,0

usually when i dont see a show on an original run i find it later on cable and realize its a gem the gimore girls is one of those rare exceptions im glad i missed it  i truly despise shows that fill every minute of the actors space with rambling stupid boring banter this is one hour of just that the mother lorelei made me wonder if she is bipolar and off her lithium she never stopped talking every minute every second talking to every person she interacted with worse yet her speech is childish and soooo like valley girl she talked about guys her hair her mother her clothes like whats the sitch for situation ive watched this show three times and still dont get the point of this series its not a comedy its not a drama it has no point except to make three generations of females in one family look like the girls from planet mars the males by comparison are smart and make the show somewhat watchable if lorelei ever existed and attempted to latch onto me with conversation id have to mace her to get rid of her she obviously doesnt know how to take a subtle hint to stop talking and start listening to someone else she also doesnt know how to really notice the existence of others  in one show lorelei comes home from a date close to 10 pm she got the date after pursuing a guy she met at an auction she goes into her daughters room where the daughter asks how it went she dithers on about how boring the guy was her date somehow got a few words in edgewise lorelei complained about how the man didnt stop talking choke hopefully the date learned how fortunate he was  one other person here commented on how the mother acts like a teen and the daughter is the adult personality lorelei even dresses like her kid this obviously 40something mom dresses and looks like she hit the mall with her high school pals in tow  i thought that this show should have been followed by just shoot me because thats exactly how i felt,negative,0
vincenzo buonavolunta a man that has spent years working at a steel mill as a maintenance man that the italian owners are selling to the chinese comes at the end of the meeting where the purchase is being arranged because he wants to tell the new buyers of a flaw he has discovered and he thinks he has the solution he doesnt exactly endear himself to the italian old management or to the new chinese owners he even fights with the translator about the exact term he wants to use in expressing his concern  the next thing we see is vincenzo arriving in china trying to contact the new owners to his amazement there is someone new in charge as mr chong the man he tried to warn in italy has been fired his next quest is getting to the woman that was the translator liu hua he finds her working in a library but she tells him in no uncertain terms she blames him for being fired from her position liu who sees the desperation of vincenzo agrees to accompany him to find his steel mill plant   thus vincenzo and liu begin a voyage through some of the bleak countryside that involves traveling by train steamship bus and truck to remote parts of the giant country finding the correct factory proves to be elusive at best but vincenzo discovers a life that is completely alien to him as well as finding a kind soul who doesnt hesitate to help the italian man in spite of her initial distaste for him  gianni amelios film is a sort of travelogue he takes the viewer into unknown territory some comments compare vincenzo to marco polo the great italian traveler although the similarities are not quite tangible the film keeps our attention in the early stages of the trip but it starts getting somewhat less enjoyable as vincenzo gets stranded after separating from liu mr amelio is an interesting director as he clearly demonstrates with this film for which he worked on the adaptation of ermano reas novel which we havent read  sergio castellitto is the sole reason for watching the film this versatile actor brings a lot to the movie which in a way is a tour de force for him as he is seen in almost every frame of the picture the combination of amelio and castellitto proves to be a winning combination ling tai who is making her debut as liu hua has some lovely moments and shows good chemistry with her costar  luca bigazzi photographed the chinese landscape in all its bleakness we see a china that is not picture post card pretty mr bigazzi captures all the greyness so typical of the areas where the film is set franco piersantis musical score serves the film well,positive,1

i remember when i first saw this movie i was in sixth grade when it happened before i saw this i had listened to the original broadway recording of it and i really loved it but when i saw this i was like what the heck this movie is missing a lot of the songs from the musical for crying out loud who decided to do all of that  i really am a very huge fan of gene kelly but this movie is probably the worst of a musical that he ever did the movie looked more like a hollywood set than the beautiful highlands of scotland and who the heck decided to cut all of megs songs out of the movie   i am willing to bet that when they saw this movie lerner and lowe were probably wondering who in the world decided to do this to our masterpiece well they had a right to say that if they did they were probably mad at the fact that hollywood turned their great musical into this rather blank movie  song and acting wise mr kelly you passed the audition with flying colors but you are in a movie that is missing a lot of the text  so in short if you want a good movie based on a musical by frederick lowe and alan jay lerner this one isnt it   310,negative,0

the thirty years that have passed since the making of this movie have made the suspense wither somewhat and will not keep the public as attentive as i am sure it did in 1979 it is still entertaining enough though  and regains some of its power when one finds out its sad relevance today check out the story of firstenergys davisbesse nuclear plant with the top of the line actors and steady pace one can learn to overlook the dated 70s environment and see it for the political critique that it is i doubt however it will survive the test of time it might not be entirely forgotten thanks to its cast but otherwise the dialog setting and score will make a remake of this movie unavoidable  as the oil situation now is comparable to the situation in the 70s and alternative sources of energy are again becoming a hotter topic we can only hope the current generation gets blockbuster warnings about the risks of privatized nuclear power like this,positive,1

i am a motion picture production major at wright state university in ohio and yesterday i was sadly given the opportunity to watch this godawful film in class we were informed by our professor that it would be very funny to us but the reason we were watching it was because it was one of the first sound films  a complete disaster  the problem with early sound films was that hollywood actors only knew how to do silent movies and they werent good at memorizing lines so producers and directors would look to the stage to get actors sounds like a great idea right well the kind of acting one does on stage doesnt show up too well on film most of the actors in atlantic look and sound like theyre acting in a play which results in lots of hearty laughs at the overacting another limitation of early sound film was the technology of microphones you couldnt move the mikes like you can today you had to keep them static or it would pick up the sound of air moving through there was usually one mike used in any given scene in this movie in one particular scene there is a man sitting at a table someone walks right up to him and delivers their line then walks away another actor comes up from behind him delivers their line then walks away it goes on like this for a couple more people the microphone is obviously right by the man at the table making for a laughable actor carousel  those are only technical problems if you get into the story and direction then it gets even worse the story is a fictionalized account of what happened on the titanic the characters are unbelievable and pointless a story about a man cheating on his wife and their teenage daughter has no place in the movie it is barely resolved and leaves you wondering why it was there in the first place a lousy attempt at high drama the actors take long pregnant pauses between lines many times it is tiresome and you cant wait for this 90 minute feels like 180 at least movie to get over with im not going to talk a whole lot about the issue of racism at this time in our country but it really offended me that there were only two blacks in the whole movie and they were portrayed as animals they both pushed past the women and children to try and get in one of the lifeboats they were ordered to stop or be shot and of course they didnt so they were shot i was appalled  i give this movie a 210 i would have given it a 110 the lowest rating possible but i gave it an extra point just because it was one of the first sound films and i tried to put it into context if you want to see a good early sound film check out alfred hitchcocks blackmail that also came out in the year 1929 you will find that the best directors were able to adapt to new technology immediately,negative,0
a lonely depressed french boy mathieu jeremie elkaim on vacation in the summer meets and falls in love with cedric the gorgeous stephane rideau quiet and slow this is a very frustrating movie on one hand i was absorbed by it and really felt for the two boys on the other i was getting annoyedthe film constantly keeps flashing around from the past to the present with no rhyme or reason its very confusing and pointless   spoilers ahead  also there are tons of plot holesmathieu at one point does something that ends him up in the hospital what is itwere never told then he breaks up with cedric and tells everybody else hes living with him why were not told then he hooks up inexplicably with another guy at the end why no explanation its clear cedric loves mathieu and mathieu is living in the same town so however it is a tribute to the film that you really care about the characters so much if only things were explained  elkaim as mathieu is not good hes tall handsome and has a nice bodybut he cant act his idea of acting is sitting around with a blank look on his faceall the time rideau on the other hand is great hes very handsome has a very nice body and is one hell of an actor also he has an incredible sexual magnetism about him there is full frontal male nudity lots of kissing and a fairly explicit sex scene in the movie which is greatmost movies shy away from showing malemale love scenes this one doesnt and it helps to see how the characters care and feel for each other  so a frustrating film but somewhat worth seeingespecially for rideaus nude scenesthat is if you like goodlooking nude young men  ,positive,1

i enjoyed this film i thought it was an excellent political thriller about something thats never happened before  a secret service agent going bad and involved in an assassination plot unfortunately for michael douglas character pete garrison they think hes the mole but he isnt   hes just a morallyflawed agent having an affair with the first lady since hes doing that hes unable to give an acceptable polygraph exam and that makes him suspect number one when its revealed there is a plot to kill the president  garrison is forced to go on the lam but at the same time hes still trying to do the right thing by protecting the president douglas does a fine job in this role i dont always care the people he plays but hes an excellent actor keifer sutherland david breckinridge is equally as good at least in here as the fellow ss boss who hunts down douglas until convinced he has been telling the truth when he does the two of them work together in the finale to discover and then stop if they can the plot the crooks are interesting too by the way also i have never  and never will unfortunately  see a first lady who looks as good as kim basinger  this is simply a slick action flick that entertains starttofinish are there holes in it of course probably a number of them and a reason you see so many critical comments however it is unfairly bashed here it just isnt intelligent enough for the geniuses here on this website my advice chill just go along for the ride and enjoy all the action and intrigue yes it gets a little ramboish at the end but otherwise it gets high marks for entertainmentwhich is what movies are all about,positive,1
bergmans skammen is one of the most realistic depictions of war ever set to film this is not an action film by any means though the pacing is faster and there is most action than in most any other bergman movie nor is this a romanticisation of war or patriotism unlike most war movies in fact the gritty realism and the deliberate ambiguity of the characters loyalties has a very contemporary feel  skammen is a darkly lit movie that should be watched at night so as to let it work its magic many of the effects are conveyed indirectly but so effectively that some scenes compete in intensity to a contemporary insanely huge budget film like saving private ryan of course the action in skammen is on a much smaller scale but it is impressive nonetheless  while the filmmaking style feels contemporary the setting of the film feels timeless and placeless the wartorn countryside and even the yet intact provincial hamlet could be anywhere any time and this film is not so much about specific historical events with specific names and dates but about universal human reactions to adversity and chaos  the acting in skammen though typically impressive from ullman and sydow is not of primary importance in this film unlike most other bergman movies through much of the film they are spectators much as we are bergman has the war imposed on them and through them on the audience and their reaction is perhaps what any of our reactions might be  highly recommended 1010,positive,1
just got back from seeing black snake moan i had spent time reading reviews  most seemed to focus on the obvious  skinny white girl chained to a black mans radiator  i hate when critics miss the point of a film now i suppose it helps that i live in memphis  and have lived in mississippi a couple of times too it may also help that i am the former director of the delta blues museum in clarksdale  but i get this movie brewers simple redemption tale is easy to follow and could have had various themes to tell the story  but i believe it is highly effect as a blues it would be my hope that people dont read all the hype  andor various reviews  and miss a really good movie get past the various things like skinny girls in white panties  get past justin timberlake accept his character ronnis which he plays very well  get past snakes on a plane and see how mercuricul samuel l jackson is  as he has transformed himself into a very believable midsouth blues man if you know little about midsouth culture a lot of what goes on may strike some as cartoonish  but accept the fact that craig brewer knows how to paint the canvas and let the actors tell the story and you will enjoy this film not one to tell endings  so go see this movie  and yes i will agree with one thing the critics got right  the music is wonderful,positive,1
i honestly think that that was the best version of war of the worlds ive every seen it was funny but it was also educational i learned whole lot the movie and if i could i would by that movie my favorite part was when the soldiers killed on robot and another one came right from behind it in the last movie war of the world i think that it should have been more like the first one and it would have been better but any way i give this movie 2 thumbs up   and if they where to make another movie like this i will definitely watch it  thank you,positive,1

this is a weak sequel it lacks the interest and light touch of the magnificent man called horse in nearly every aspect and when compared to each other they hardly seem to be the same genre  the return is almost a parody of the first and tries to evoke different indian ceremonies but comes across as trying way too hard to bottle the magic of the first in this film the tribe is lost and abandoned having lost their homelands modern life has encroached on paradise and they are living in abject misery and poverty perhaps this is the point the first film took us to a place where we would want to be a simpler time this takes us to broken indians in a miserable world and the white man is the hero and savior which rather negates the whole idea of the film  the beauty of the first lay in the fact that the white man learnt and discovered that real civilization lies in values rather than western materialism in the second film this is all but lacking and so we end up with a weak film  a huge disappointment,negative,0
i watched this movie or part of it in hope that it would be fun to laugh at how bad it was but it soon became clear that this was just plain silly for one you have the worst acting ever the lead actress birgitte nielsen is terrible uninspired and hardly even attractive and she certainly do not look like the female warrior who could easily kick some veteran warrior kings butt but she does and whats with the feminist attitude its plain hypocrisy for one her family was killed by a women then she joins some warrior school or something so she can learn how to fight men she then joins up with a fat servant and his child king whose city was destroyed by gedren those two characters are just plain stupid and destroys the little of atmosphere that the movie managed to create after this i could not take any more of nielsen painful acting and the stupid clichés and lack of some real action  schwarzenegger as kalidor was the only part of this movie which actually made it remotely watchable   i liked the conan movie but this is pure crap,negative,0
to the small minority seen here praising this film get serious i know its down to peoples personal opinion at the end of the day but anyone with more than a couple of brain cells can surely see that this is total rubbish so bad it does not deserve to be part of this franchise i can only assume those saying how great this is are friends with somebody involved in the film and are trying to give their career a push poor in every way dont con people by saying otherwise storyline is a weak rehash of the previous entries script is likewise attempts to hide the lack of originality by using a girl instead wow dont disguise the filmmakers lack of ideasand there is sadly a complete lack of any scares absolutely no redeeming qualities utter utter turd ive awarded this pair of chancers one mark simply for having had the nous to get someone to fund this piece of crap they must have put more effort into that than they did into actually making the film shame,negative,0
i liked this movies its a another yash raj film which you know will look good on screen all character are always nice or very nice with one exception who you know will eventually covert to being nice another rule of yash rajs film is that either hero or heroines have only one or none parent think back to all of those films mpk suman didnt have mom hmapk salman didnt have parents and final rule is that you are 90 likely to see alock nath crying  the film is good too its a bit slow at first but keeps you entertained there is almost no comedy but it does make you smile often enough the little kid heros nephew is well placed and deliver very good one liners the actress is very pretty but shy you wouldnt get that in real life this film doesnt have massively big happy families living in big house which i thou was a good idea and allowed the film to be differentiated from other films there will be lots of women crying at the end of the film there isnt a strong message from this film but its a good watch if you are married arranged marriagethe film will remind you of what you went through and if you are not it will inform and may be scare you   overall a very good looking film no big plots or twists but a very gentle film very much like bollywood classic,positive,1
functioning as a sort of midpoint between waiting for guffman and a mighty wind best in show portrays a dog show and the various people who bring their canine friends to participate some are weird some crazy and otherwise but they all make the movie good director christopher guest is particularly funny as gay harlan pepper very much trying to promote his dog eugene levy parker posey michael mckean catherine ohara and bob balaban also do great jobs i cant imagine them not doing great jobs at least not in a christopher guest movie as someone whos never attended a dog show this movie is my main exposure to them they sure look neat,positive,1
the first toxie film was dark gory and hillarious this film is ungory battles to cheezy jazz music no real gore at all and the worst toxie mask i have ever seen his deep voice is now a light happy voice characters from part 1 reappear by actors that look nothing like them claire mom junko characters names change claire or sara it is lacking all the brutal violence dark humor and political incorrectness of the first film if it werent for nudity this movie could have been rated pg really lame i am a huge fan of part 1 though just cant stand this one,negative,0
i remember this game it was always sitting on the shelves alone until one day i decided to try something new for a change and got this game i stared in awe at it since it was the first ever game for the ps1 that i owned that had 4 discs when i played it i couldnt put the controller down seriously  the storyline of this game is so good and twisted its almost as good as the final fantasy vii storyline and that is hard to accomplish when you play the game you get so involved with the characters its unbelievable that its only a ps1 game as it feels like a movie and i believe it should be made into a movie  too bad this game is a very unheard of game and barely no one has played or liked it as it is one of those games that is sitting on the ends of the shelves with a 50 off sign sitting on it trying to sell well i am one of those people who always look at those on the ends and try them out and most of them turn out to be really good heck that is how i got into final fantasy vii looking in a catalog and finding it but this is different than final fantasy  legend of dragoon is the only game or rpg that is better than most square enix games surprisingly i wouldnt be surprised if it was made by square enix but its not hardly any games i play are better than the final fantasy series or the dragon quest series but this one is but what really bugs me is why it is very little known and is not praised which it should be  graphics are pretty good for a ps1 game but what can you expect from it its ps1 man made in 1999 story i have already mentioned is amazing almost beats vii characters are a amazing you get involved so much with them and their actions  a definite 10 out of 10 definitely deserved more praise and a very well done rpg by a company other than square enix,positive,1

the bbc and hbo teamed up to create dirty war a 90 minute tv movie about a terrorist dirty bomb attack in london the film gets down to business quickly as it packs both the terrorist and the government antiterrorist efforts into the film leaving little room for human interest subplots on the terrorist side we follow the bomb from the smuggling of radioactive materials to assembly to deployment to detonation on the government side we see pr and training exercises intelligence gathering and analysis interdiction postdetonation response and follow up the film also imparts a sense of how alqaida type terrorist cells are organized the radical islamic terrorist mentality and terrorist strategies a sort of anatomy of a dirty bomb incident dirty war will answer many questions lurking in the minds of a public becoming ever more aware of this insidious threat b,positive,1
i had a bad feeling ten seconds into the film as a pair of overworked tumbleweeds probably left over from a bad western blew across the scene the bad feeling grew ten seconds later when the obligatory opening strangerturnedhumansacrifice for no apparent reason lowered his rear view mirror to see a shadow in the back seat for the next five minutes over the opening credits we are treated to an overhead shot of the car rocking back and forth and only the dramatic madefortvmovie music informs us a killing is taking place not a makeout session for the next 27 or so hours we are treated to two idiotic psychotics who for some reason seem compelled to drive through the desert southwest together going after each other like a demented abbot  costello even with the shocking twists at the end we are merely left to shake our heads and wonder if the producers and directorwriter feel as ashamed and embarrassed as they should for creating this inconsistent incoherent nonsense,negative,0
a flying saucer manned literally by a crew of about 20 male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from earth to check in on a colony founded some 25 years ago on a forbidden planet what they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman and her father a hermit philologist haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization he has immersed himself in  on the surface this story is a pulp scifi murder mystery some compare it to shakespeares tempest but this is a stretch and in some ways an insult to the scifi genre stripped of what makes it a scifi film sure its the tempest but how many hundreds of films can you say something similar about   underneath this is a cautionary tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for its appropriate and safe use yet the film still proceeds with all the hopefulness for our future that we have come to expect from shows like star trek  anne francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful the special effects and even the aesthetics of the backdrops are powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven acting almost unnoticeable if it were not for the goofy retroartdeconess of 1950s scifi props you might think you were watching a 1960s piece  this is a classic of that very special subgenre of sci fi i like to call 1950s scifi and though not in my opinion the best it is certainly a must see for anybody interested in scifi film and special effects the clever plot now rendered trite by its reuse in six or seven episodes of star trek lost in space and even farscape is worth paying attention to and will sustain the interest of most scifi fans trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film which seem to have inspired themes of star treks original series aired about 12 years later though they may find themselves disappointed by the relatively mild 1950s sexism and the lack of any kind of racial integration while i do not mean to nitpick the lack of social progress manifest in this film was the one major problem i had with it   some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young goodlooking leslie nielsen in one of his first starring roles unfortunately nielsens performance is only average and at times downright poor especially at the climax of the film walter pigeon though quite excellent in other films overacts his role as well ms francis earl holliman and the amazing robby the robot are the standout actors in this crowd though on the whole the character actors filling in the ensemble do a good job the problems with the featured performances i think are as much the fault of the director and the editor as anything though they certainly got most of the film quite right,positive,1
dumb is as dumb does in this thoroughly uninteresting supposed black comedy essentially what starts out as chris klein trying to maintain a low profile eventually morphs into an uninspired version of the three amigos only without any laughs in order for black comedy to work it must be outrageous which play dead is not in order for black comedy to work it cannot be mean spirited which play dead is what play dead really is is a town full of nut jobs fred dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of billy bob thorntons character from a simple plan while jake busey does a pretty fair imitation of well jake busey  merk,negative,0
this is one of those filmspilot that if you knew battlestar galactica it helps but isnt necessary what makes this even more believable of a story than bsg is that this isnt something so far away in the future this has such a depth to it that it is quite astonishing it was not released theatrically the leads could not have been chosen better in such experienced  quite talented actors eric stoltz is superb as the father who will do anything to be reunited whis daughter however real or not she is  hell do it no matter the cost paula malcomson of deadwood fame is terrific as his wife as well you are not sure completely of his motives whether its love or money or both but that is what makes this pilot even more intriguing i see a star in the making of zoe played by the relative unknown alessandra torresani  her performance esai morales is terrific in his desire to see his loved one again  just how wrong to be even considering what he wants more than his moral objections i didnt think this would be a good idea when it was announced but from the pilot alone i am thrilled to see how we got to the bsg stage story its great to see adama as a child already being affected  influenced by the different sorts of robots starting to permeate life at this stage i just hope that they can keep up the stories so we can figure out even more how they got the the humanoid typed robots this is an almost perfect pilot  i hope they can keep up the fantastic storytelling even the visual effects are better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen if you havent gotten into bsg  least try this  ill bet you become a fan  will want to see how the bsg story came to be,positive,1
i wonder how much this movie actually has got to do with the 1984 movie bachelor party starring tom hanks is this movie even an official sequel this movie is lacking in every department and youre obviously better off not watching it  for a comedy this movie simply isnt good or funny enough it relies mostly on the characters their stereotypical assessments rather then the movie actually features some good original and funny moments  of course there also is very little story present and the movie nude breast than script pages you just keep waiting for things to finally start off there is a main plot line in it somewhere but that one is so terribly unoriginal and gets executed so poorly in the movie that it feels more as if its something nonexistent i guess there even is a message and moral story in it somewhere but this again is so terribly unoriginal and poorly done in the movie that it simply does not work out  its basically a typical teenage comedy with lots of sex jokes and nudity only without the teenage main characters which makes the story all the more sad and tasteless the movie makes some really wrong jokes that are misplaced for any type of movie  i regret ever watching this  310,negative,0
i really like harrison ford so i eagerly rented this movie only to be disappointed minute after minute mr ford seemed to be walking through very warm water looking for a place to urinate his costar was very good and had the better lines the story intrigued me but the mistake  big mistake  as everyone is identified via drivers license or passport before they board any american commercial aircraft left numerous plot questions in my mind   i could have cared less about these people in fact the subplot of the internal affairs investigation was more interesting than the two lovers killed while flying first class to miami  i am disappointed in the director sydney pollack who gave us the classic tootsie and other films this one is a waste of time and energy,negative,0
my father the hero used to be my favorite movie when i was younger its about andre a divorced french man who wants to take his beautiful daughter katharine heigl on a vacation hoping to get a little closer to her but of course nicole isnt that easy to get along with she just started puberty im guessing she is angry and hurt that her father was never there for her and decides to give him a hard time one day at the beach nicole meets handsome ben and she makes up a wild story about her and her dad the whole island gets involved and the movie turns into a hilarious wild entertaining movie i would give my father the hero 810,positive,1
i feel very sorry for people who go to movies with a pad and pencil to write down flaws and keep notes on how bad a movie is i feel equally contempt for people who go to movies and cant suspend reality andor let themselves enjoy 90 minutes aways from their boring or busy lives get a grip people ecgtb is a very entertaining movie if you take movies seriously this is not for you if you are expecting the movie to resemble the book in any way this is not for you but if you enjoyed the utter hilarity of priscilla queen of the desert or the what the hell am i watching of moulin rouge or the gross out comedy of the sweetest thing then let yourself escape to cowgirls it has some really funny parts hilarious actually it also has some really good musickudos to kdlang also did i mention it has 90 minutes of uma thurmanneed i say more,positive,1
spike feresten is a comic genius talkshow demonstrates a fresh take on the kind of odd ball irreverence that have made shows like letterman and the daily show successful his likability is palpable he seems to find the unique angle of the joke not the predictable sitcom paththank god his comedy is reminiscent of the award winning arrested development cross your fingers that talkshow has a longer life span the topics he highlights tend to be those things that pass by unnoticed by everyone else yet when he creates a joke around them out you wonder how you missed it the first time around i particularly enjoyed the sketchesunfair target will be a cult classic in no time set your tivos peoplethis is a show not to be missed,positive,1
now this is one of bigs best jack hulberts single role in 1931 split into two for the band waggon radio team askey  murdoch it boasts a great stalwart cast who ham the play up for all theyre worth especially askey of course histrionics were provided by linden travers melodramatics by herbert lomas and pragmatics by richard murdoch  the group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find more than they bargained for ghostly trains spectral porters hairy sausage rolls and arthur trying to entertain them all his repartee with everyone falls between sidesplitting and ghastly dull when the formula works its very good but it sometimes gets very contrived and forced making the film seem more dated than it is but those damn treacherous fifth columnists  thank any god britain hasnt got any nowadays  ultimately a nice harmless film to welcome back to the tv screen as an old friend but if you were expecting to be shivered out of your timbers youll probably be very disappointed,positive,1
in the 1980s patriotism and in some cases flat out jingoism was pretty high do we get to win this time a line famous from rambo first blood part ii could almost sum up how many people felt at that time a longing for the style of films they grew up with flat out balls to the wall were good your badnow lets blow something up and go home while rambo rocky and for the most part top gun seemed more geared towards attracting an older crowd iron eagle went straight for the kids canadian writer and director sidney j furie brings out everything that you love and hate about that time period the kick in the pants rock out 80s anthems never say die road of the gypsy etc to the over the top and sometimes almost unbelievable action adventure iron eagle succeeded for one reasonit was fun  fun its the type of movie you can turn on and sit back and enjoy every ridiculous totally 80s moment you dont have to think about if it could really happen or if the acting is truly believable its just funand thats all you can really ask for in this type of movie,positive,1
spoilers herein  my high school did all they could to try and motivate us for exams but the most memorable method they used to get us into the right state of mind was a guest speaker who was none other than australian kickboxings favorite son stan the man longinidis the first mistake they made was giving this guy a microphone because he was screaming half the time despite us sitting no more than 3 or 4 feet away from him now his speech was full of the usual if you fail to prepare then prepare to fail stuff but there were various instances where i got really worked up the guy stood there in front of us preaching how throughout his life he did everything for himself and noone else he was offered many deals in the past to give up kickboxing but he never took his eye off the prize of becoming australias greatest kickboxer he said that he wasnt a sellout he was happy and a retiree he wasnt ever involved in any other activity other than kickboxing then he plugged his film yes you heard right he plugged his new film as he talked about it he got a woman to come in and hold up a poster advertising it and then he showed this shitty 4 minute clip of this vile film called trojan warrior this all being before he was defeated by gurkan ozkan in his final career fight for now  stan plays ajax a kickboxing exspecial forces agent that is pulled into the seedy underworld of melbourne ajaxs cousin theo arthur angel recently sold out well at least stan didnt stray too far away from everything to the feds and as a result is on the run from all walks of organized crime ajax and theo get into all sorts of ridiculous situations from fighting in a kebab shop to posing as playboys at a bondage party its all pretty ridiculous but if silverstein was actually aiming to make a credible film here this man should never be handed a camera again   ill admit i was actually pumped to see this i love action films even if theyre corny and especially if its set in my own backyard but what i was introduced to was a film with acting that was appalling from the word go and continued to do so after the words for the love of god please make it stop subplots were introduced and not even touched on again after they were out in the open characters were just thrown in for absolutely no reason whatsoever and the most overchoreographed fight scenes that didnt even remotely reflect stans actual talent in kickboxing the cast consisted of useless cameo appearances by just about anyone remotely famous dermot brereton mark chopper read and greg matthews the whole time youre sitting there and playing the guessing game of just who is standing there in the background too bad the movie relies heavily on splitsecond appearances by former celebrities remember those plotholes i told you about ajax once upon a time was apparently locked up wrongly accused for murdering his wife now we hear that ajax was in special forces via one single sentence in the whole film and then leave it for buggery this is followed by another single sentence which persuades ajax to help the same people who wrongly locked him up then get this at the end it is revealed to ajax that his wife isnt actually dead but was sold into prostitution do we see her no does ajax go off to find her as soon as he hears this no now thats a marriage   amidst all this irritatingly puerile crap some website described this film as a cross between jackie chan  guy ritchie has this man ever sat down and watched a jackie chan film chan shows more dexterity taking a dump than stan did doing well anything and guy ritchie is the crimefilm messiah and youre comparing him to salik silverstein this film is more like a mix between pizza and enter the ninja   now where do you thing the whole trojan warrior title comes from ajaxs fierce fighting skills like that of an ancient greek warrior no the gangsters unification to find theo like that of the trojan empire no its because wait for it theo carries a condom around with him yes that right because theo is always prepared with a trojan brand rubber in his pocket he is a trojan warrior   i had the displeasure of seeing trojan warrior on dvd as well as its special features    video clip of chop chop a rap song by mark chopper read chopper did this for the sole purpose of proving that anyone can rap the funny thing was chopper just rapped for 30 seconds and then threw it over to these two albino teens from doncaster using such words as dis and dope etc in their australian accents face it people rap was developed in the states leave it there the clip looked like something a channel 31 cameraman on ecstasy put together    bloopers there was no real difference between these and the actual film    stan the man longinidis kickboxing featurette this wasnt too bad considering it was just 6 or 7 different fights shown from different angles i think i saw dennis alexio fall over about 15 times in that 3 minute montage  i dont want to say this film contributes to the reason this country is going to hell when it comes to film but oh wait i just did my advice to anyone reading this is for you to go out and buy 4 or 5 copies of trojan warrior tape them together and use it for a paperweight because this movie is just that damn bad,negative,0
i recommend idiocracy to everyone luke wilson is very funny the movie is insightful and made me laugh so hard i had tears running down my face several times until the end when i took a breath and realized just how close we are to mr judges vision of tomorrow  keep an eye out for a cameo by the guy from the mac commercials justin longas dr lexus i found his performance oscarworthy especially considering what oscars have been handed out for in the recent pastbesides hes cute  in short idiocracy is a fatally funny glimpse into a possible future where people are named after product brand names the presidents middle name is mountain dew hospital visits cost 5 billion dollars there are mountains of garbage because no one is smart enough to figure out what to do with it all and nobody cares about anything but money all because only stupid people are breeding sounds familiar to me somehow oh yeah its what i think of when i see professional wrestling  seriously watch this movie its a good laugh and it will make you think,positive,1
what a great show a very underrated dramatic show it is great how there are no main characters and every episode some other characters are the main charactersi think the best character on the show is vern schillinger he is a tough bad guy and an aryan on top of that which makes him a true bad guy prisoner who there are many that are known to be this show has many murders i think it is a little over exaggerated for the killing on the show but i have to admit that is one of the reasons why i think the show is so greati think some characters were killed off a little early but some sure still made their mark you cant compare things like prison break to this show they are totally different i think some of the actors on the show are also very good and underrated and should what is due to them a great show my favorites a show that should be considered of the the greats for years to come,positive,1
during my teens or should i say prime time i was eating up all kinds of sf novels every day of the week it was in the sixties and seventies when tv was not such a important leisure time killer like today one night in the mid seventies i watched the movie on tv i think it was ard and i was stunned i was impressed in a way that i can almost remember each scene even today  nowadays i observe my kids playing the sims or something like that and i think we are close to what that fassbender movie expressed i also would highly appreciate if i could buy this movie on a dvd but in vain i tried almost everything to get a hint where the movie matrix cannot touch by far the quality and the state of art of this movie and by the way by now we do not have a glue if we were a superior reality or just one of a couple simulation models probably after our death we definitely will know,positive,1
i watched this again after having not seen it since it first came out in 97 and it still made me laugh out loud its skillfully written kevin kline and joan cusack are both perfect in their roles and if you can look at bob newhart in this movie and not chuckle youre more of a man than i  for that matter i think the scenes where tom selleck kisses kevin kline where kevin kline listens to the how to be a man cassette and the postalmostwedding scenes w joan cusack are three of the funniest scenes in any movie  sure the last scene is a bit of an excuse for a happy ending butfew movies are perfect,positive,1
fans of gerry andersons productions will recognise several actors and vehicles from ufo which was made after doppelgänger  as well as sound effects from various anderson series barry grays excellent music mostly unique to this film adds to the feeling of familiarity for these reasons alone i think any gerry anderson fan would find doppelgänger worth getting  judged simply as a film it has to be said that doppelgänger is flawed it is known that there were major problems during production and i suspect this is why there is a timeconsuming plot thread that ends abruptly and appears to have no relevance to the rest of the story presumably timebudget constraints prevented the relevance from emerging  distractingly the special effects range from outstandingly good  better than any 1960s film that i know of  to disappointingly bad   nevertheless even with these flaws doppelgängers main story is well told and keeps the viewer or at least this viewer engaged throughout the ending is perhaps not what one might expect from anderson yet at the same time it is typical of anderson and it is certainly appropriate to find out what i mean youll have to watch it for yourself ,positive,1
its not just that the movie is lame its more than that this movie is just unnecessary do we need another western how about a western with afroamericans in the titles roles sound stupid implausible and a lame attempt at modernizing the genre it is incredibly lame and simple minded its like that lame baz luhrman film romeo and juliet where he set it in modern times to attract young folks and create some hype with his revamping of a classic tale well baz luhrman failed miserably and so does this mess the story is actually not bad however the whole idea of removing the racism out of a racist genre by casting an all afroamerican cast is racist in itself its also puerile and simple minded like baz luhrmanman hes a bad director hey i hear you say this was directed by mario van peebles hes also in the film how can it be racist its not i said the idea of casting all afroamericans instead of caucasians was the film isnt racist its just pointless stupid and very very boring,negative,0
from the upper shelf of great classic books comes this masterful story written by pearl buck the book like the movie is called  the good earth it relates the story of wang lung paul muni a simple chinese farmer who begins his day with a trip to the great house where he has taken a slave woman called olan luise rainer and made her his wife almost from the beginning she begins to adapt to his kindness by saving a small peach seed and planting it near her new home during the following years olan proves her worth by steadfastly sharing her husbands toil troubles and changing fortunes through the passing years they raise a family and watch their simple household weather both feast and famine indeed its at the lowest point in their lives that each discovers the value of companionship loyalty and love with the changing times their growing family is both aided and threatened with friends and relatives like their uncle walter connolly who is a scoundrel and charlatan but is compassionately tolerated wang has his old father charley grapewin to advise and remind him of lifes fragile and fickle nature two notable actors who make impressive appearances in this film are keye luke who plays wangs elder son and phillip ahn who plays a nationalist soldier the film is in black and white and is wonderfully adapted from the novel highly recommended for all audiences ,positive,1
this is a terrible production of bartleby though not as the other reviewer put it because it is unfilmable but rather because this version does not maintain the spirit of the book it tells the story almost painfully so watching it i could turn the pages in my book and follow along which is not as much fun when dealing with an adaptation rather see the 2001 version of bartleby featuring crispin glover that version while humorous brings new details to the film while maintaining the spirit of the novel whats important is the spirit not the minutiae of things like setting character names and costumes the difference between these film versions is like night and day tedious and hilarious this version is a lesson as to what can go wrong if an adaptation is handled poorly painful mindnumbing schlock,negative,0
after dark my sweet is a great modern noir filled with seedy characters dirt roads and of course sweaty characters it seems that most of the truly great noirs of the last two or three decades have taken place in the south where the men glisten and the ladies um glisten too why because its hooooottttttttttt and because everyone looks better wet at least the men do  sweaty women leave me clammy   anyway  there might be some spoilers in here   this film is a wonderful example of everything a noir should be  steady pacing though some with attention disorders refer to it as slow clearly and broadly drawn though not simple characters and tons of atmosphere noir if anything is about moods and attitudes thats why the great ones are not marked by your traditional definitions of great acting look at bogart mitchum hurt and nicholson  they and their characters were anything but real  but they had style and sass and in a crime movie thats exactly what you want or quickly paced adventures again all great noirs seem to be on slow burn like a cigarette great noirs create an environment and you just inhabit it with the characters for a couple hours   after dark my sweet lets you do that  and it lets you enjoy the company of some very interesting and complex characters uncle bud and collie are intriguing  never allowing the audience to know what really makes them tick  and patric and dern i love bruce dern by the way are pitch perfect dern especially see previous comment they take the basic outlines of a character and give them depth and elicit our sympathies   the story itself is also interesting therere better plots in the world of noir hardly any mystery here  mostly its suspense but this one is solid if anything the simply okay plot has more to do with jim thompsons writing than anything else with thompson plots are almost secondary he eschewed the labyrinthine tales of hammett and chandler for simpler stories with stronger more confusing characters look at a novel like the killer inside me and and youll see right away from the title what its all about when it comes to thompson its not what its about its how its about it to quote roger ebert so really the relatively simple plot of a kidnapping is not the point and if you dont like it well the jokes on you   why this is an 8star movie rather than a 10star one is because of the female lead shes not bad per se but shes not angelica huston or anette benning see the adaptation of jim thompsons the grifters if you dont know what im talking about  besides its a better movie and you should start there for contemporary noir  its the best of the 1990s and challenges blood simple for the title of best since chinatown she simply doesnt have the chops or the looks for that matter and though she and patric have some chemistry i dont have it with her so there,positive,1
nothing could have saved this movie not even superman  ten years ago the special effects would have been amazing better directing might have gotten some more feeling and better performances out of the actors but nothing but feeding the script to a dragon could have fixed it plot holes bad lines terrible pacing endless replaying of the same shots of a cgi dragon stomping through hallways ugh  avoid this one at all costs  ,negative,0
just another film that exploits gratuitous frontal male nudity awful acting plus the lovemaking scenes are the most unsexy ive ever seen and this is not about me not linking the idea of two young men making love since im gay  again as in mil nubes de paz julian hernandez directed an incredibly pretentious film with a story that makes enough argument for a short film of about five minutes but manages to make a 2 hour film with it and this time there isnt even the issue of racism and commodification in the mexican gay community to talk about god gracious have mercy on us,negative,0
one of those classics held up next to deep throat and behind the green door  sure it was clever but the female lead isnt that attractive and sex isnt that hot but if not for this film porn would not have blossomed into what it is today  harry reems was the ron jeremy of his day worth a look if youre a fan,negative,0
a movie visually graceful but interesting is mainly the plot the film depicts a zigzag progress of exploring the main actors innermost feeling max who has lived in new york for two years and intend to marry a girl he met there comes back to paris and unexpectedly meets his exgirlfriend whom he still fancies very much but finally finds out the one he loves the most in fact is her best friend nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well the three women max has met symbolize something we must pursue although possibly having no clear picture about the underlying motivations his fiancee is the one he needs rather than the one he loves and thus completely no loyalty we can see she gives him also no love but only stability true love also cannot be found in his relation with the exgirlfriend merely a fantasy for him to escape  many things very romantic he has done for her but almost nothing seems amenable the one who really animates maxs life in fact is her best friend the equilibrium achieved at the end is not identical to the initial equilibrium because max has understand much more about his innermost feeling the nonlinear structure makes the progress of searching look more complicated not equally ingenious as pulp fiction but things seem much more natural in the apartment max is not the only character who undergoes a transformation and in fact interesting is also the description to romane bohringer the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing   ,positive,1
the silly saying you cant touch this surely applies here with all the clone horror and scifi films coming out along with all the inferior remakes its hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your time thats why i always rely on the classics that scared the weewee out of me when i was a preteen  the thing is without an ounce of doubt in my mind the goriest ickiest screechiest scifi horror classic that john carpenter or any other director sorry even you mr spielberg ever made what really gives it power though is not the gore it ooooozes of slime and blood and god knows what other fluids but rather the sense of dread isolation and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer  you cant get more remote than antarctica and in this howling freezing white setting is where the story takes place several americans researchers and military men are stationed there one day they witness a siberian husky dog running for dear life from gunwielding norwegians before they know it the american outpost is battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants it may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before its finished but once its finished if you didnt see it in progress you cant tell it among humans or other normal earth animals  kurt russell keith david wilford brimley richard masur donald moffatt tk carter thomas waites and charles hallahan are just a few of the fine cast this film is the reason why horror can be a great genre it actually still scares me the alien blood jumping out of the petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes me jump  still the scariest of them all,positive,1
followup to 1965s my name is barbra and shot in brilliant color color me barbra has la streisand alternating nostalgia clowning comedy feminine romantic angst and beguiling seriousness for a crazyquilt hour of showbiz razzle dazzle shes a cutup and a femme fatale a sprite and an enigma with her egyptian eye makeup and everchanging hairstyles shes also a chameleon her voice is rich and moving even if a few of her songs are not one kiss yesterdays the circus sequence isnt as intriguing as the museum trip with the conceit of barbra becoming the images in the paintings an idea which works better than you may think the circusmedley built around songs featuring the word face is girlishly cute without ever really becoming enchanting still this is a lively jazzy specialnot quite as emotionally tantalizing as my name is barbra but certainly a sterling sophomore effort,positive,1
literally every aspect of this sciencefiction lowbudget flick falls under the categories that have been classified for its predecessors contemporaries and those to follow bad special effects a weak storyline ridiculous amounts of blood and gore annoying and pointless characters all that you can expect attack of the sabretooth is about a new vacation resort where the proprietors are genetically engineering smilodon cats for an attraction the cats escape and begin to kill people the guy running the show wants to save them and not warn the unsuspecting visitors about them and there is a band of visitors and some employees who rebel and plan to kill the cats  special effectswise the film is about an average achievement given its budget the sabretooths are portrayed through poor cgi amazingly though the cats look more realistic in an upclose detailed shot rather than the longer more distant shots where the cgi is better concealed their attacks are recklessly bloody and distasteful just as youd expect they attack rip off some arms and legs and leave very little behind this is part of the reason why the film descends into poor schlock  the plot and characters are just as horrendous we have some college kids who come to the island and they plan a scavenger hunt and take it very very seriously even so much as to trespass on private property tamper with security systems and steal why are they taking a simple game so seriously did i miss something was there money involved or were they sent to do it i dont know i could barely follow the film but it seemed to me like they were just doing it for the fun of doing it even so they went too far for normal  attack of the sabretooth is a very poor film even for a lowbudget scifi flick it is a very poor and cheap example it will bore most viewers to tears might be attractive for some and will make you chuckle and laugh all the way through and keep in mind this is not a comedy this is a cheap horror flick so its not suppose to be comical,negative,0
i was probably one of the few australians not watching the tennis when this series aired i have to say when william mcinnes first appeared i though that is one crappy actor but as the series continued he toned down his performance and i totally loved him he was such a rotten guy but he did make me laugh i watched the show to see hugo speers heart and bones the full monty and tom long seachange two hands it was interesting to see speers play a nice quiet man and even more interesting to watch tom longs rippling muscles sigh seriously longs performance was a total shock and really brilliant he stole the show martin sacks was good also in a small role and the leading actress put in an entertaining performance id recommend this programme if you enjoy stories with a twist and watching tom long walk around with no shirt on,positive,1
my giving this film a score of 8 is relative to other featurelength films from 1930 by the standards of films made just a few years later this film might receive a score of only 6 or 7mostly because the sound quality was so poor now it is possible that the film sounded better and the fox movie channel did show a degraded print it did have a lot of lines and scratches but i assume the sound problem was always an issue thats because sound in movies was still a novelty in 1930 and many of the hollywood talking pictures of 1930 sounded terriblewith background characters often drowning out the leads characters huddled together to make sure they are picked up by the microphones or inconsistent quality such as what was seen in the bishop murder case hells angels and other films of the day this was all made much worse in the big trail because most of the film was shot outsidesomething unheard of at the time quite an innovation but also something that really stretched the talents of the sound technicians so while the film was very hard to listen to i realize that they had to start somewhere so i can forgive thisespecially since the outdoor scenes are breathtakinga major innovation for 1930  the plot is rather similar to cimarrona western that came out the following year and which captured the oscar for best picture unfortunately cimarron isnt all that great a film and i actually like the big trail more due to the scope of the film while some might balk at the big trails slowmoving pace i saw it as a great history lesson about the hardships endured by those traveling west on wagon trains plus the whole thing just looked so beautiful as director raoul walsh went to significant trouble to film on location and the big trail looks almost like a film version of some ansel adams prints  as for the acting it was pretty good this was a major break for young john wayneas his previous screen appearances were at best minor and unremarkable here he was given the lead and did a dandy jobthough he was obviously young and a little less john wayneish than he was in later films as his screen persona was not yet firmly established another interesting part was played by tyrone power ii tyrone powers father he looked nothing like his extremely handsome son and looked and sounded almost exactly like bluto from the popeye cartoons he made very few sound filmsdying just a year after making this filmso its a rare opportunity to see and hear this once famous actor  overall the film is well worth seeing despite some sound problems and a few overly long scenes here and there for 1930 it was a remarkable achievementmore so than the much more famous and awardwinning cimarron made the following year much of the reason the big trail didnt win an oscar most likely was because all quiet on the western front came out the same year and it is truly one of the great films,positive,1
i saw this movie in the theatre and it was a terrible movie the way michael oliver who now turn even worse in the sequel is the biggest intolerance i cannot bare junior upset his father because he would not go to school which got his father ben madly insane also the crazy dance ride operator is not fair to junior for not letting him go on the ride and that lawanda dumore is as horrible as a serial killer to junior because she made threatening insults to junior which is why i cannot tolerate this movie even if the movie is rereleased back into theatres in the extended version i still would not see this movie because this movie is not something i can even tolerate in fact it stinks,negative,0

there has been a lot of love that has been put into wes andersons fantastic mr fox unfortunately all the love is for himself granted there has been a lot of time and effort been put into making this ever so selfconsciously quirky universe but if only the same time and effort had been put into the script to try and make it funny the worrying thing is that i think it was and this is the best that wes anderson could come up with  the animation is good in the closeup shots of the animals however when the camera is further away everything becomes really harsh on the eyes and to be perfectly honest looks like a bit of a mess there wasnt really anything special about the acting either with wes opting to choose his buddies and big names over more specialised voice actors that could have probably made the film better im pretty sure george clooneys voice acting resume consists of two cameo appearances in south park one of them where he played a dog  the film is too smug and trying way too hard to be clever and different and is typically despite the film being set in england all the good animals are typical americans playing baseball whilst the bad guys are stereotypical english with the most insulting english accents i cannot stress how much of a waste of time this film is i didnt laugh once,negative,0
gómez pereira is the responsible for some of the most despicable comedies of latest spanish cinema just take a look at his curriculum vitae so i didnt expect that much of cosas que hacen in fact i dont know why in the world did i decide to watch it anyway i just did and what a surprise it looks that gómez pereira has finally matured and now hes capable of making a good movie hes last work deals with the midlife crisis the disappointing and the seeking for a second chance after youve ruined it all the last half hour of the movie the more dramatic is the best part and it just makes worth watching the film also we have eduard fernandez playing the main role and i keep on thinking hes the best actor of his generation by far  my rate 710,positive,1
hedy lamarr who may have been kept by more men on screen than any other actress is again the kept mistress of kent taylor society playboy and general all around rat on a boat from the yucatan after taylors given her the brush she tries suicide but doctor spencer tracy saves her from drowning in the caribbean  tracys quite the all around medical fellow i guess he never heard the word specialist he runs a clinic in manhattan for the poor and his trip was a sideline into medical research lamarr and he marry and she tries to introduce him into her world and he even becomes a partner of society doctor louis calhern of course kent taylor reenters the picture and the hollywood inevitable happens  watching i take this woman it seemed to me that the writers were very much influenced by tracys oscar winning boys town unfortunately his role as doctor karl decker aint a patch on what he did as father flanagan maybe they were trying to give father flanagan a little romance in his life in this film so to speak  tracy and lamarr did not get along too well in fact this film was dubbed i retake this woman because the original director joseph von sternberg walked off the film presumably because lamarr was not working out for him the way marlene dietrich did she did lady of the tropics and then mgm went back to filming this with their contract director woody van dyke who was known for the speed of his productions and a whole new supporting cast was brought in  fortunately both spence and hedy had better roles in store for both of them,negative,0
its a good movie maybe i like it because it was filmed here in pr the actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome the guy is cute too so its a good match if you want to the guy or the girls,positive,1
  attack of the killer tomatoes is a parody of bad monster movies which ends up being worse than the movies it spoofs the very meager story tells of tomatoes who revolt against those who treat them badly basicallythey spin and growl yesthey growl and the next thing you know the person is covered in ketchup the actors are nonames who never made movies after thisso there would be no point to name them theres a guy whos hired by the governement to try and stop the menace of tomatoes hes accompanied by a black guy whos master of disguise and a girl and a guy who dives anyway theres another woman who spies on the first guy that works for the government if this isnt making much sense to you you understand this movie never would have been very good in the first place but it even lacks the fun of laughing at stupid attack scenes the movie is horribly cheezy which although being the whole pointreally really hurts what couldve been a reasonably entertaining movie at one point a giant wax tomato slides on an unconcealed plank of wood with wheels on it maybe i wouldve recommended the movie if it would have enjoyable camp value but even this is lacking from this terrible movie 210,negative,0
i was very willing to give rendition the benefit of the doubt when it came to all the negative press i had read concerning it even about threequarters of the way through i still thought it was jumbled and a bit incoherent but otherwise a solid tale reaching its conclusion and then the bottom fell out not wanting to necessarily ruin the film for anyone but the conclusion flips everything you held to be fact about what and when things have been happening on its headfor no particular reason whatsoever except to maybe tell the world yeah im cool and i know it i love a good twist i love a good ahha moment but only when it is relevant to the story at hand the complete misguidance on the part of the filmmakers serves no purpose on the overall tale timelines didnt need to be parallel and they didnt need to be separated by a week all the revelation did was destroy any merit i was about to give director gavin hood and screenwriter kelley sane which may be a good thing because looking back it wasnt really as solid a movie as i initially was going to blindly give it credit for  it is an admirable thing to try and get the term rendition out into the filmgoing publics consciousness but it needed a story that delved deeper into the connotations and politics involved rather than gloss over those issues for a tale of a woman in distress over her husbands disappearance and the angstfilled rebellion of a daughter against her interrogator father i understand that the bottomline film attendee needs a human quality to grasp onto and for that reason i dont fault it for going that route my only qualm is that we dont get enough of what the title says we should be getting instead we are shown numerous plot lines all confusingly brought to the forefront before being sent back into the nether regions of our consciousness never to be returned to so much is going on that you forget what you are supposed to be caring for the wife the interrogator the cia agent the victim the senator the middle eastern daughter and her zealot boyfriend at the end i really just gave up and let the film take me where it would which ended up being someone totally different than what it first laid out  everything that occurs happens as the result of a bomb explosion this bomb is at the center of every story thread and finally ends up being so innocuous that you cant believe how huge the waves it spread were the old butterfly wings flapping quote is in full effect because one boys mission for revenge ends up destroying the lives of so many whether by death destruction physical and emotional abuse or career suicide no one really escapes unscathed however at the end of the day only the story about the man who has been excised to egypt for torture is really interesting we are led to believe he is unequivocally innocent from the start yet he is waterboarded electrocuted etc in order to extract any information he might have when those in power include a man with no compassion or reason to stop until something is spilled whether true or not and an observer without the guts to partake or stop it the situation lends itself some intrigue as to how it could possibly end the three actors involved all are the best parts of the film and prove once more that the movie should have concerned itself with them for the entirety  i dont want to belittle people like reese witherspoon the victims wife or her senate employed ex played by peter sarsgaard because they actual do a good job with what they are given even meryl streep her kooky accent and alan arkin dont detract too much however it is the trio of jake gyllenhaals cia agent yigal naors interrogator and omar metwallys victim that truly shine naor is brilliant as the egyptian trying to stay sharp as a razor during working hours yet compassionate and worryfilled as a father attempting to locate his daughter this man is brutal but he is because that is what his occupation calls for and why he is relied upon to find answers metwally never gives a false second during the pain and suffering inflicted upon him whether he is lying or truly knows nothing about the terrorist who has been calling his cell phone we totally buy into his plight and desperately wait to see how the situation turns out as for gyllenhaal someone who seems to have one performance recycled throughout his career with varying degrees of success he finds a part that suits him the demons entering his soul throughout the ordeal he is forced to be a part of wear on his body and mind causing both ambivalence and a need to intervene the two feelings wrestle with each other until he makes a final decision and his stoic boyish demeanor suit that battle perfectly  it is just too bad that the one plot line working never finds itself as the main focal point despite being the namesake of the film with all the clutter around the edges we as an audience get bounced around too much lulled into a sense of time and sequence and then slapped in the face as it all unravels in more of a laugh on us then a bet you didnt see that coming i felt cheated and unfortunately that is the lasting effect i have taken from the movie had it been more straightforward i might have enjoyed myself more but as is one can still take some positives from the severely flawed whole,negative,0
anyone who rates this movie above a 3 has a very distorted view of movies anyone who rated this piece of sht 7 or higher i have absolutely no respect for their taste in movies and doubt they have ever seen a good one i am always up for giving any movie a shot and i did with this one i tried to pay attention i tried not to let my money go 2 waste but 15 minutes in my friends were laughing at me cause i was listenin 2 my ipod 25 minutes later i couldnt even watch the overacting that was occurring within the film so i up and left i have never ever ever walked out of a movie until this garbage anyone who said they enjoyed it is a liar or they should be banned from this site i get so angry when i see a person rate this an 8 when the godfathers overall rating is a 91 its like saying that that movie was close which it isnt,negative,0
rating 1010 master piece  some years ago i heard spielberg comment that he would redo the movie here and there if he had a chance well mr spielberg i guess nothing is perfect but this movie  together with schindlers list  is your best even oprah acts well in this one   what got me most is the realism of the story and drama stuff like this happened and is still happening in the world,positive,1

i was intrigued by the title so during a small bout of insomnia fueled by my curiosity i stayed up and watched it i then checked my tv listings and watched it again there is one very obvious realization that occurred to me when i saw this film in spite of politics traditions culture etc teenagers everywhere are virtually the same the characters of the kids from belgrade could have been transported to lets say somewhere in the american midwest during the same time period and language differences aside would be impossible to tell apart from any of the local teens of that era they certainly displayed the same growing pains and preoccupations politics aside music sex movie idols music drinking sports music as a matter of fact much the same things that occupied my time growing up in 1970s southern california  this was a bittersweet story but the joy of youth made it very enjoyable the characters especially the young actors were completely believable also i wont say this was the yugoslav american graffiti but i will say that it fits in nicely with other 50sthemed movies,positive,1
this movie is actually funny if youd like to rest your brain for an hour so then go ahead and watch it its called blonde and blonder so dont expect profound and meaningful jokes what this movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about two blondes its just a funny movie to watch on a date or with a company of friends especially if youre not too sober lol  pamela and denise are still pretty hot chicks its a mistake to judge this movie as a piece of art cmon this movie is about blondes its supposed to be light funny and superficial one more thing i do not think that girls will appreciate and like this movie but guy definitely will,positive,1
ive spent quite a while going through all the reviews for this film im in total agreement with almost every reviewer in saying that noahs ark is crap crap crap crap crap dont the executives at nbc have any class i feel sick to my stomach for actually watching both parts of this miniseries the script is so dumb so pointless and yes totally inaccurate i can understand making a few changes for dramatic purposes but this film changed just about everything in the story god himself is going to go through the trouble to kill off the entire earths population but he somehow misses one guy thats sailing around trying to sell stuff to noah give me a break and what was up with noahs sons acting like indiana jones saving girls in distress if all that isnt bad enough theres the part where god apologizes to noah and says im sorry noah i was wrong newsflash nbc god can not be wrong this film is the most tasteless and disgraceful biblical film ever made,negative,0
when precious bane aired in america i was stunned by this beautiful story all the actors were brilliant clive owen really understood the character he played i went right away to a bookstore and ordered the original novel which is even more beautiful and which went out of print just after i bought the book  although ive seen it online a few times now i had also hoped with the oscar won by janet mcteer and the huge popularity of clive owen the bbc would naturally get this fine production on dvdi cannot believe all these years later we still have no dvd it has to be the only production ever created by the bbc that is not for sale come on bbc  you have money to make off us fans here get this on dvd please,positive,1

connie hoffman is very pretty and is attractively topless at times  thats it folks the sole reason for even considering whether to watch this film or not  these 70s sexploitation period pieces are sometimes entertaining by virtue of their very datedness flared trousers big hair zapata moustaches etc this one isnt  the script is bad the acting is bad the direction is bad and the idea of having a senior citizen romantic leading man is exceptionally bad  the title hinting at a sex comedy is grossly misleading  i heartily recommend avoiding this one like the plague,negative,0
i think this movie is a very funny film and one of the best national lampoons films it also has a very catchy spoof title which basically sums up what the whole movie is about men in white the story is a spoof of many films including a will smith film as you might have guessed men in black i will not give the ending away but it has a very good ending in is very funny leslie nielsen style humour from start to finish especially the bit near the beginning when thy are in the street collecting the dustbins garbage cans also they have a pretty cool dustbin lorry garbage collecting truck in that scene too the acting is not superb actually it is not very good but that is what makes the film funny it is a comedy loosen up i love the story line partly because it is so far fetched and partly because it is interesting to see how subtle or should it be unsubtle they rip off all the other films i am great fan of unserious spoof films but i am also a fan of the real thing and with this films it is hard to decide which is better the film it mainly rips off mentioned earlier i this review or the actual film it is but also when you are actually making a spoof of comedy films it actually makes it even harder but this film carries it off successfully the two garbage men are so funny it reminds me of a tv sketch show in the uk called little britain this film is a must for your collection and is one of the best most entertaining funniest best storyline national lampoons film to date,positive,1
after some of the negative reviews i heard on this movie i was doubtful of giving it a go but i had £399 in my wallet  thought id gamble on buying a budget like movie  saw this and gave it ago  im glad i did i enjoyed it directed by the star of films such as chain reaction the ring bourne identitybrian cox i had to gamble with this even if it was rubbish but it werent at all i found some of the humour quite funny especially alfred molina the star of spiderman 2 the character doc ock he was excellent the most enjoyable part of the film of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw matthews name and that made me get it and no his part isnt big at all its very short at the very end of the film its not a big part which makes me believe thats why people hate the film i suggest you give it a go some parts are a pit poor that needed polishing the acting and a bit more action but its watchable,positive,1
as a fan of henriksen i liked him in the millennium series and of course lorenzo renegade lamas i had expected at least something from this film sadly the plot is predictable the acting is bad and the computergraphics used for most stunts dont work out sometimes it even looks like theyve captured some shots from microsoft flight simulator  the cinematography sucks as well unnecessary funky camerawork in the beginning only detracts from the cheesy dialogue and gives the film a cheap madeforvideolook it works in hiphopmovies and jet li movies but seems out of place in this flick  i would have liked this film 10 years ago i was 11 then,negative,0
have you ever wondered why these guys  seagal stallone willis et al  manage to survive all those gunfights in which theyre outnumbered i think ive got it figured out the enemies always miss and the hero doesnt  here seagal has a pistol and outshoots a half dozen heavies firing at him from a few feet away one of the heavies has a shotgun or maybe two of them have it doesnt really matter there could be a thousand shotguns blasting away at him and seagal would still emerge with his ponytail intact  and when it comes to mano a mano combat  forget it the evildoers may or may not be armed with swords or knives or blunt object but seagal with his skill in aikido or tempura or sushido or playdo or whatever it is brushes them aside with a few dismissive blows not only is he a master of these outré skills but his physical strength is herculean more than once he snaps somebodys long bones as easily as we would break a toothpick one he breaks a guys spine over his knee  ill tell you something im getting into the spirit of the film here because seagal uses that line ill tell you something several times along with whats that supposed to mean these guys are fully deserving of extinction in any good xenophobes handbook they are all black speak with unintelligible jahmaycan accents wear dreadlocks that look in dire need of a shampoo they torture and murder with aplomb and  heres the worst part theyre unchristian thats right they practice voodoo  actually the voodoo element comes close to being the most interesting element of the film they got the constituents of the ritual pretty well  cigar smoke rum spitting the sacrificial chicken they only left out the possession dance in which the spirit rides the dancer they should have read metraux on voodoo  otherwise the plot adheres to the usual conventions what was done to jaqueline bissett by the voodoopractitioners in the deep is done here to a friend of seagals what was done to john wayne when he was stuck between trucks in mcq is done here to seagal himself at the movies very opening when seagal makes a brief speech about having seen too much pointless violence in his dea career so hes now happily retired and when we are introduced to his friends and family i tried to keep track of his affiliates to see if i could pick out which ones would be horribly murdered or maimed to generate his quest for revenge  the acting doesnt really require much comment but charles the jamaican cop played by tom wright is really pretty good wright has considerable range here hes an associate of dubious allegiance rather sinister but in the pentagon wars he has a comic part that he underplays perfectly  the jamaicans never flew as movie villains i dont know why exactly its a small movie market and if you go to jamaica stick to montego bay however if you want to see jamaican voodoo drug dealers as heavies and if youre in the mood for another typicalstandard action flick this should be a satisfying view,negative,0
i may be getting ahead of myself here but although the film itself was a technical masterpiece for its time i watched it piecebypiece on tcm last night the question arises to me why did they do that putting their lives in jeopardy many of them died on the trek why would they undertake such a lifeendangering journey just to find food for their animals  once they reached the land of milk and honey why didnt they just stay there would you endanger your life and that of your entire community just to find food for a herd of cattle as dangerous as it was to do it for that purpose alone shows the inbred simplicity of these types of people risk death for a cow better them than i,positive,1
this movie really has no beginning or end and its really very unbelievable maryk and ashley are supposed to be interns working in a mailing room for an italian fashion company but for some reason theyre put up in a 5star hotel conveniently located across the street from the coliseum and all of the other interns they work with are just as abnormally modellooking as they are one thing that i found obvious in this movie is the way that one of the twins doesnt end up with the guy i guess they tried to twist their usual plot a bit nice try,negative,0
i had recently been watching johnny test in an attempt to find humor in it i failed horribly cartoon network usually has a tendency to make their shows enjoyable by all audiences but johnny test is entertainment in its lowest form the writing is incredibly predictable and the running gags arent much gags at all kids will love it and thats about it  now this isnt to say that its all bad the original opening theme was actually pretty catchy but for some reason they took the skeleton of it and figuratively smashed it with a figurative aluminum bat its a shame because that was really one of the best things it had going for it  some of the characters could be very interesting in theory with a little work the characters could work well together but theyre too onedimensional then again this makes it easy for the kids to follow   the pace is a bit too fast as well the episodes are too busy leaving little time for clever writing this is a real shame because there are so many interesting concepts that the show brings forth on the upside however the fast pace will stop the kids from losing interest and thats really the entirety of the target audience  overall the show looks very good on paper but just doesnt succeed in being funny or interesting this is a show i want to like but im incapable of it theres just so much potential that isnt realized kids will enjoy it but thats about it,negative,0

im a big fan of lucio fulci many of his giallo and splatter flicks are amongst my favourites of all time but this made for tv movie is extremely sub par and not what ive come to expect from the great italian director the film is neither interesting like some of fulcis more tame giallos or gory like the majority of his cult classics thus leaving it lacking in both major areas and ultimately ensuring that the film isnt very good the film works from a plot that has been used many times previously but still its an idea that always has the chance of springing an interesting story just because it focuses on the theme of the afterlife which is the ultimate unknown this film focuses on giorgio mainardi a man that isnt exactly well liked and after he dies of an apparent stomach hemorrhage there arent many people that are sad to see him go this means that his ghost is trapped somewhere between life and the afterlife and so he decides to try and get to the bottom of his death and his only ally in this endeavour is his daughter  the video that i saw this film on is proudly proclaimed that the film is in the style of hp lovecraft and thats one of the most blatant attempts to sell a film ive ever seen there is nothing even slightly reminiscent of the great horror writer in this tale and the reason for that tagline would appear to be because of title similarity to the stuart gordonlovecraft film from beyond  which is a lot better the film does benefit from a distinctly italian style and the score is rather good unfortunately however fulci has seen fit to positively roast every scene in it  and so the theme quickly becomes annoying the plot plays out in a really boring way and most of the scenes simply involve the ghost desperately trying to find things out or the daughter placing her suspicions over her family members this movie was made for italian tv and so its not surprising that its all rather tame theres a little bit of gore and a nightmare sequence with zombies but this isnt the fulci we all know and love overall this film is extremely mediocre and not a good representation of fulcis talents not worth bothering with unless youre a fulci completist,negative,0
while i was watching this movie i never thought id be defending it its honest enough from the begininning about not having much of a plot theres no real characters to latch onto except the killer some of the acting can be better but most of it is capable  i know a three out of ten isnt stellar but there are reviews saying it was shot poorly and completely useless etc i think it set out to do what its supposed to fairly well the lighting is minimal at times more natural than most audiences are used to but its supposed top look like a camcorder snuff film in fact at times the quality is probably still too high to be true to that but nobody would make it through tne minutes of camera work thats truly that bad  its not particularly scary but it is disturbing at times there are one or two characters who dont come across as believable at all and the soundtrack does get tiring at times but overall it was put together cleaner than a lot of camcorder movies,negative,0
this was an excellent movie with good acting and it keeps your attention through to the very end maybe people are either tired or uncomfortable with the subject matter and thats why its being trashing so much it could also be too deep for many of the viewers out there who give movies like the american pie series higher ratings  jake gyllenhaal is a cia analyst not an agent who is to observe an interrogation of an egyptian man by moroccans not egyptians hes not supposed to be a hardened agent and so comes off as naive of the interrogation techniques used this is more believable than if he were to come across as being an old hat at it  the story jumps around a bit and can be confusing but it also makes you stay focused on whats going on until the end when everything comes together as the puzzle falls into place the supporting actors did a good job of helping to carry the movie i found the movie to be powerful and thought provoking,positive,1
altioklar master of the thieves   watch some movie steal some parts of them write a script it must be very easy to be a director in turkey i think altioklar watched identity 2003 saw 2004 a few series which is about crime murder etc then he said eureka eurekai have found it after that he wrote the script of the movie  you can guess the murderer at the beginning of the movie it took only 10 minutes for me he shouted im the murderer im the murderer there is no mystery   tamer karadagli is samesux exaggerated mimics funny macho man   there is only one good thing in the movie the performance of demet evgar is very good you may see the movie just for that,negative,0
i remember devil dog playing on tbs almost 20 years ago and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day its not that bad for a madefortv horror movie but it is derivative mostly of the exorcist and businesslike for lack of a better word it wont blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting but its not a waste of time either its the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you arent in the mood to think too hard  however if you go into the movie looking for some laughs you wont be disappointed the early scenes with lucky the devil dog as a cute little puppy with children of the damned eyes are hilariously nonthreatening and the climactic bluescreen effects of a giant black dog with horns are pretty sidesplitting and keep an eye out for the cloaked satanist in maverick shades toward the beginning  not a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination but i wish they still made stuff like this for tv,negative,0
about 15 minutes in my wife was already wanting to leave not so much because of the material but the lack thereof they decided to fill in the blanks where the funny stuff shouldve been with as much language and absolutely vulgar talk as they could when this would let up very rare wed sit back and watch not laughing mind you and wait for the next grossout or offensive remarks after about 35 minutes we both got up and left everything wed read said how great this was the trailer looked good and roger ebert actually called it intelligent and said it wasnt a crude sex comedy did he go to the right movie along with be cool its the only other movie ive ever walked out onand i have no regrets im sick of trying to go see comedies in america,negative,0
108 tarzan and his mate 1934  released 4201934 viewed 8608  john dillinger escapes from prison and robs a bank in iowa bonnie  clyde kill two highway patrolman in texas births ralph nader gloria steinem alan arkin richard chamberlain  doug after we were rather disappointed with the original tarzan the ape man we discovered among fellow users and historians that the second film tarzan and his mate was the best in the series its true i got a huge kick out of this movie johnny weismuller returns as the titular vineswinging animal dueling wild superhero and maureen osullivan reprises her role as his entirely fantastic lady love jane who sports a twopiece outfit for the first and last time here in my review for ape man i stomped on jane pretty good for her obsession with clothes and her incessant screaming but shes redeemed herself for me here make no mistake osullivan is the star of this movie and jane is the most capable character in the entire cast she acts as the ambassador between holt and tarzan she can function perfectly in the jungle and get along with the animals and she knows how to hold off an angry pride of lions when shes out of bullets shes even got her own jungle scream now the chemistry between johnny and maureen is irresistible shes totally got him trained cheeta is quite charming as well taking drags off of martins cigarette the plot is mostly an excuse for tarzan to do battle with the jungles most vicious animals especially lions crocodiles and rhinos the effects though always visible are much more dynamic and cool and complement the action nicely oh and you cant talk about this movie without talking about the nude swimming scene all i can say is yes she is naked very exciting stuff  kevin wow just wow when it comes to downanddirty precode actionadventure nothing holds a candle to tarzan and his mate the inevitable sequel to tarzan the ape man is a kickass violent and risqué jungle epic i doubt there will be another tarzan movie in the future that takes no prisoners the way this one does youd be hard pressed to find a full scene in this movie that would be codeapproved or animal rightsapproved for that matter the gruesome violence doesnt even wait for the happy jungle couple to show up before it pushes even the limits of todays adventure movies and after tj enter the picture theres plenty of early morning cuddling and assnaked afternoon swims see it for yourself if you dont believe me i love maureen osullivan most of all in this film in the first film jane seemed like a walking contradiction like the writers back then just didnt know how to portray a character like that but here she is a great precursor to kickbutt females of later cinema although she still requires tarzans assistance in getting her out of most jams she does a lot more than just waiting around to be rescued her personality is perfectly believable for a woman who has been living relatively comfortably in the jungle for a year i watched this with my mom and i enjoyed pointing out to her just how much jane has tarzan trained as jeff foxworthy put it she totally has the ape man at her every beck and call although there is a host of dated optical effects throughout the film there is still plenty of hairraising tarzan vs predator battles that are performed mostly for real that and the mendressedasapes are a lot more convincing this time around spoiler the film climaxes as the jungle erupts with a shocking orgy of animal kingdom violence that leaves tarzan and jane the only two humans still breathing although the couple rides off into the sunset reunited and victorious i cant help but imagine how this story will seem to the next safari who will hear about the previous bunch of humans who went to find tarzan and jane and were never heard from again end spoiler one of things that still bothers me is johnny weissmullers smooth hairless bod and overstyled coif other than that this is precode actionadventure that is absolutely not to be missed  last film it happened one night 1934 next film twentieth century 1934,positive,1
congo is another multimilion dollar adaptation of crichtons works like jurassic park the lost world sphere etc the film raped the book of its true meaning and essence ill make this short and to the point the scenery is beautiful the actors well its the best they can do the script try congesting hundreds of pages into an hour and half movie you get a mess in the end but how neat of a mess is what counts and congo falls somewhere below that there were some silly moments like why did the killer gorillas decide to jump into the lava and amy raised by humans surrounded by humans yet can intimidate dozens of killer apes around her what sort of twist of common sense is that which brings me to this if there was an annoying character in every movie amy ranks of one here you see amy is this naive little female ape who can talk with a special backpack and harness strapped to her neat idea but it gets annoying after awhile hearing her talk congo is worthwhile to see and not deplorable but certainly not a memorable film either,negative,0

this is yet another bad movie that you should probably avoid watching the plot could be a lot thicker than it actually is and would be better made as a blockbuster type movie  the acting leaves something to be desired though you can not quite place your finger on what it is  this is one of those that you watch on late night tv perhaps on usa simply because you can not get to sleep watch it if you want but do not expect too much from it,negative,0
when i first saw this show i was 9 and it caught my attention right away when stewie was trying to call lois on the phone in the hotel i laughed and kept on watching when the episode was finished i wrote down the name of the cartoon and watched it regularly this separates itself from the simpsons and other shows on say cartoon network because the jokes are more mature not too much but its tv14 for a reason the quick film cuts after each punch line and cute funny movements and behavior of the characters make it special talented seth macfarlene is the creator and the voice of quite a lot of characters in the show a good theme song and a crazy family that theres always something funny makes this my favorite cartoon along sealab 2021 and aqua teen hunger force check it out its funny stuff,positive,1
flat characters that you do not and never will care about cringeinducing dialogue at places no twists they think they have one but if you didnt figure it out after about 40mins youre not too bright lots of well know actors in roles and performances that fortunately for everyone involved will be forgotten as soon as the end credits roll  i dont mind slow movies but theyve got to be going somewhere this one doesnt  the plot wasnt what made this a directtodvd movie thats just a rather convenient excuse to try and drum up some fake controversy  the asofwriting 37 ten 10 ratings must be from people involved with the production,negative,0
ive seen directors cut version and can be nothing but content excellent acting esp cole hauser i was sad about little space for claudia black though subtle visual effects and photography in overall believable plot considering the genre without a lot of logical holes really nonpredictable twists buildup characters these are the greatest assets of the movie combined with style  some may consider this movie a bgrade effort but i would disagree with that the whole thing really is very original and stylish  and even though im not a fan of vin diesel this tough guy role of riddick suited him well cant wait for chronicles of riddick its really cool this flicks gonna have a sequel  910 if you ask me,positive,1

i cant even believe that this show lasted as long as it did i guess its all part of the dumbing down of america personally like david spade said i liked this show better when it went by its original title  seinfeld what bothers me the most about this show aside from the obvious base sense of humor and general smuttiness is the pretentious way the episodes are titled truly great shows are still funny after many repeated viewings like the one where rob gets accidentally hypnotized on the dick van dyke show or the one where lucy and ethel work at the candy factory in other words its an honor bestowed upon great programs by the viewers that the writers and producers of friends would have the unmitigated hubris to actually title the episodes themselves in such a fashion before anyones even had a chance to even see it a second time speaks to not only the mediocrity and lack of original thinking on the part of said writers but also of the stultified minds of their viewers  you read the comments of some of these people and can only come to the conclusion that they live in a hallmark cardlike neverland full of greeting card sentiment the true meaning of friendship i want to be a friend i want to live in manhattan wake up these people are supposed to be working in coffee shops and looking for work as actors but they somehow manage to live in 4000mo apartments get real all i have to say to those amongst us that want to move to manhattan and live the idyllic new york life with your rosses and monicas good luck with all of that that new york doesnt exist for anyone making less than a serious sixfigure income but good luck with all of that anyway now shutup and pass the soma,negative,0
do not be misled this is not a zombie movie take it from a guy who loves zombie movies and who rents them all the good and the horrendous yes this movie has an extended zombie sequence but its basically an artsyfartsy exercise in existentialist dread which is a long way of saying its boring if youve worked hard all day and want to spend a couple of hours being entertained rent something else  rise of the undead has cheap special effects mediocre acting and crummy dialogue all of that is understandable in an indie lowbudget film and i can forgive such flaws as long as a movie has an entertaining story to tell unfortunately rise of the undead hardly has any story at all moreover the acting is not laughably bad so much as nonexistent all of the actors seem to have studied at the buster keaton school of wooden faces would it have killed them to show some emotion and no yelling does not equate with emoting the one character who actually had some pizazz was killed off first granted there was another character who briefly held my interest he looked and acted like kyle mclachlan channeling norman bates but it was too little too late  the filmmakers seemed to have forgotten a tiny detail film is a visual medium that means lighting your scenes well enough for the viewer to actually view whats going on and all those artsy jump cuts and close ups might have seemed cool at the time but all they did was make watching the film jarring and confusing there is nothing wrong with telling a story in a simple clear fashion  just look at george romeros lowbudget night of the living dead to see how its done superbly and i know these folks had a small budget but if you cant hire the equipment and technicians necessary to actually make the dialogue audible then just go ahead and make a silent movie then those buster keaton wooden faces might actually work  i will say this for the film the zombies were creepy unlike most zombie movies where the undead are shown in all their decomposing glory the grosser the better the zombies here were just shuffling bloodyfaced people it actually worked to make them more like us and therefore scarier thats the reason i gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1  the sad part about all this is that despite all of its flaws rise of the undead does not insult your intelligence the filmmakers seemed to have actually wanted to make a smart scary original movie and its a shame that they failed so miserably if they could just forego the toofancy editing buy a few extra lightbulbs crank up the dialogue and come up with a real story that actually goes somewhere then i think they have the talent to make something really good  trust me do not waste your time on rise of the undead,negative,0
just watched it me and my better half could not believe how awful and badly acted it was if anyone else thinks its good then you must be easily pleased i actually gave up a night out to watch this its all been done before ie hostel springs to mind but at least that did not make you cringe with the bad acting and lack of story line same old stuff rehatchedi read so much about this film i even recommended it to my mates my faultsomeone said it was good no more goryhorror or reeling back in disgust than your average scary movie it has to be said please dont bother with this movie get mary poppins now thats scary im off out now go to the cinema and watch something scarier than this little miss sunshine maybe,negative,0
as an avid fan of cary grant i expected to watch this movie and howl with laughter as amc billed it as a comedy i have never been more disappointed with a film carys usual charm and effortless comedy are awol from this entire movie he comes across as strained bored and just not himself mississips character ranks among one of the worst stereotypes i have ever witnessed  his accent is terribly exaggerated and incorrect according to which part of mississippi he claims to hail from and whenever he does deliver a line its several decibels higher than any other cast member mississip tried to make himself stand out in the film as a lovable countrybumpkin goofball but in the end he manages only to detract from the already weak plot mansfield looks more like an obscene blowup doll than a hollywood sex kitten and while she was never known in hollywood for her acting ability this film screams that she never had that ability to begin with ray walstons character was sugary and ultimately contrived for four men on shore leave it was the tamest leave ive ever seen i watched this nightmare until its very end and while i wont spoil that for anyone i will tell you that its the most absurd youll ever see the film tries to spark patriotism and a sense of debt to the fighting men but the film misses that point totally because of its weak plot line and weak cast sorry cary,negative,0
i watched this movie for the first time the other day and was bored to tears i guess i just was looking for some flashback to the wonderful series that i remembered i watched the mod squad television show religiously back in the day and it was fantastic it was action packed and the relationship the 3 had with greer was endearing there wasnt any of that here when greer was murdered you get the idea that these 3 could have cared less the actor who portrayed pete is a really good actor but they wrote his part like he was mentally challenged pete in the television series was quiet and serious but had a funny side also they had this guy acting like he was either on drugs on the time drunk or just plain ignorant i wouldnt recommend this movie at all especially if you were a fan of the tv series it will be a complete letdown,negative,0
if there was ever a call to make a bad film that reflected how stupid humanity could become this one would take the prize the plot centers around bible prophecies that lie in hidden messages of the scriptures that prompt a group of powerseeking thugs to attempt total control of the world just how stupid does this writer believe people to actually be    the acting was bad at best casper van dien wasted his talent doing this film michael yorks work was a fair match for the role since he was the center of the film and did a good job    this plot was sickening and very disturbing no tender or immature minds should see this film this is how a basic good vs evil plot can go astray   there must be a lot of mental disease floating around the film circles who look for ways to market this type of junk there must have been something censored out to get a pg13 rating but it was still awful,negative,0
walter matthau is best remembered for the long series of comedies he did with his equal comedy partner jack lemmon from the fortune cookie to the odd couple ii but people tend to forget that in the late 1970s he appeared with another partner in two films  a female partner this was glenda jackson the english double oscar winner who demonstrated her comic abilities against matthaus first in house calls and then in hopscotch matthaus role was slightly larger in both films because his characters were more central to the plots but the chemistry between them was quite good if you ever want to see two pros demonstrating how sexual intercourse can be crazily funny watch walter and glenda as dr charley nicholson and ann atkinson experimenting to see if two people could have sex on a bed under the old movie code rule of the two parties each having one leg on the floor never has sex been looked at from such a clinical and mechanical point of view  matthaus charlie has just been widowed before the film began he has only had one woman in his life  his wife so now hes the eligible bachelor he also is the leading surgeon in the hospital he works out of but the chief surgeon is dr amos weatherby art carney carney is apparently senile there are moments later in the film that show he turns his senility on and off  see the scene where he rams richard benjamins car amos is up for reelection charlie is his closest competitor for the post  if he wants it however amos manages to convince charlie to let him keep the job for reasons of selfesteem  one day charlie notices ann in the hospital she has had a slight accident and is resting in bed but amos has put her into a cage like apparatus which charlie remarks has not been used since about 1920 he gets her out of the device and soon is romancing her she joins the staff of the hospital but she is critical of charlies willingness to cater to amos and she is critical of certain selfish tendencies she sees among the doctors in the hospital  amos bungling causes the death of a wealthy patron of the hospital lloyd gough who owned a baseball team his greatest innovation being separate admission costs for double headers amos tries to calm down the young widow of the team owner delivering the eulogy at the burial service the line in the summary above is the peroration line of the eulogy however she is still determined to sue her lawyer thayer david says the hospital is the most incompetent hes ever seen so amos suggests that charlie romance the widow to satisfy her from that expensive lawsuit but how will ann react to this the film is quite amusing and was so successful that besides causing a sequel for jackson and matthau it led to a television series as well,positive,1
i absolutely loved this movie i am not even sure what particularly about it but i think it was wonderful and should be available for dvd the women were strangers and yet got along well enough to spend the time they did in the villa in italy the actors in my opinion did an excellent job the characters were all so different and yet clever story that made it work there is humor drama and relationship issues all in good time this requires 10 lines but i just cant think of any more to say so i will just rattle on until i get 10 lines so sorry about this what else can i possibly say it has been a long time since i last saw it i am looking forward to view again but it isnt available,positive,1
when i read the reviews of kahin pyaar na ho jaaye i thought huh it was that confusing to be sure i went to watch the film and what do you know its a remake of the wedding singer several scenes have been changed to suit the whole essence of indianness but the rest of it is a direct lift from the 1998 hollywood hit bollywood is no stranger to remakes but this is one so poor that it pains me just to watch it i groaned so much watching this and i realized i wasnt the only one doing so one guy actually walked out of the theater and never came back salman khan should seriously stop doing comedy roles he shrieks and whines too much why cant he just take it easy he doesnt do justice to the role originally acted out by adam sandler he doesnt have sandlers sense of comic timing rani is a wonderful actress and one of my favorites but shes no drew barrymore either the scene where she stands in front of a mirror practicing to say her new surname hi im mrs pugalia doesnt match up to barrymores version hi im mrs julia gulia i felt embarrassed watching that scene even though i had loved the original the music is not too bad its probably the only saving grace of this otherwise horrible film avoid this at all cost,negative,0
dont listen to the misleading title werewolf woman the europeans are well known for putting an emphasis on sex and nudity over actual scares in their horror films but this one here is just a bit too much werewolf woman seems to have a sleazy sex scene copped off with the title character going crazy and brutally killing her partner fun the first few times but a hundred minutes of this becomes very monotonous quickly shes not even a werewolf but a schizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy the film cant even decide its tone with the first ten minutes a flashback being legitimate supernatural horror i thought i was in for a trash classic after these to a rather poor character study of the female being repeatedly abused and tortured to a revenge thriller at the end the director insists this is based on a true story yeah all right  to be fair there are a few entertaining aspects of the production the title werewolf woman is a looker and there are a few nice gore effects and nude scenes however these become rather monotonous quickly also the dubbed dialog is pretty hilarious in a camp fashion especially the worlds most swinging doctor he drinks on the job unfortunately the film becomes pretty irritating fast theres no actual plot or anything else really its a shame because reading a description i felt the film had some real potential werewolf woman is far overlong slow moving and a bit too pointless even by the standards of the exploitation genre 410,negative,0
i rented this one to see vanesa talor one more time she can act but doesnt get a chance in this clunker the opening sequence is an elaborate crane shot of mountain landscapes must have come from a stock archive because the movie is shot direct to videotape the production values make blair witch look professional theres a really cheesy animated statue but no other effects worth noting this movie is bad but not amusingly so the players would do well not to mention it on their resumes,negative,0
i saw this film and heard the writerdirector juan gerard speak at the santa barbara intl film festival  all i knew about it was that it was the story of an 8yearold boy at the time of the cuban revolution in 1958 and how it affects his home and family  its opening scene will bring to mind cinema paradiso in fact the film is filled with references to classic films the roulette wheel casablanca chicken clucking rebel without a cause references to bunuel touch of evil youll find more the homeless man georg stanford brownis a reference to cuban folklore which often uses a black man as a type of greek chorus  what this film really is is the culmination of a dream gerards wish to honor his family and medium of film that he has loved all of his life  this is the true story of juan gerard and all the people in it are realas are the events depicted gerard is actually an architect and engineer and passionate film lover but his dream was to make this movie he and his wife decided to live that dream and harvey keitel became an angel who believed in gerard and agreed to produce and star in it keitel holds the screen powerfully as the mysterious and secretive grandfather che brown and keitel are the only americans in the cast iben hjejle high fidelity and gael garcia bernal y tu mama tambien offer strong support in key roles  truthfully the first half of the film suffers from stiff delivery of lines and some overracting but stay with it the last half is much better as the events of the revolution combine for the bittersweet and honest climax it is the first effort of juan gerard but it is honest as he is and his passion and heart really come throughin this sincere first effort i would definitely see it again and hope that he continues his film career  ,positive,1
i just finished dark chamber aka under surveillance and im stunned stunned not by the film but by some of the rave reviews i perused which influenced my watching it the story was so ravaged by plotholes and the majority of the acting so flat categorizing it as a comedy seems appropriate seriously i found myself shaking my head and laughing in bewilderment as i endured this movie  justin leaves the confines of living at home with a pain killeraddicted mom to go live with his cop father despite moms warnings that dad is no good when a young woman is found murdered justin becomes suspicious of the tenants who reside in the adjacent apartments with the help of a couple pals he installs covert cameras to keep tabs on these folks as the truth begins to unravel justin uncovers an unexpected secret  one positive point is that felissa rose is hot i would have generously slapped an extra star or two on here had she peeled down a bit but no such luck it would have been the films potential saving grace eric conley played justin very adeptly i thought and i wouldnt be surprised whatsoever to see more of him in the future   the general premise of the film although plagued by clichés might possibly have worked had it not been for the ridiculously hollow performances of key cast members most notably alexandra eitel kayla and david h rigg justins father the horror pardon the pun  i have nothing against lowbudget films indeed i believe independent film is our only hope for decent film making in the days to come ill cut lowbudget films quite a bit of slack when it comes to special effects lighting even musical score and the overall picture quality i dont give allowances however for stick figure acting and a swiss cheese lovers script there are a vast number of competentlymade low budget films out there sadly this isnt one of them i cant help but suspect that at least a few of the reviewers who have praised dark chamber here are in some way affiliated with its production,negative,0

first of all what is good in the movie  some pretty actress  the exotic background  the fact that the actors dont laugh while acting i would have if i had been in their situation  i dont know the storyline is simple  a catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who another abstract painter killed his little brother a male prostitute raped by another priest when he was young im afraid there is nothing here to learn or to let think a little about serial killers art or religion dennis hopper is not very good here this is the worst episode of the worst season of profiler the serie with replacement actors and unbelievable coincidences the uncle is the policeman who the girl who lives at another victims house could have a baby with the priest etc etc,negative,0

i was going to say this was the worst gaythemed film ive ever seen but i can honestly say this is the worst film if any genre ive ever seen  you know youre in trouble when a movie starts with a personal note from the director asking for the audiences understanding for the many challenges facing a firsttime director the audio track is so bad in many scenes its almost impossible to follow the dialogue and this from a dvd version bad lighting bad sets bad photography poor script generally bad acting all add up to make this film unwatchable i did make it through to the bad ending after several attempts and immediately gave away the dvd i foolishly purchased im sure there are many challenges facing a firsttime director but dont try to palm off this lame attempt as a finished product i see from imdb details that this was not only the first directing attempt of richard natale but also the only thats the one positive thing i can say about this alleged movie,negative,0

professor paul steiner is doing research in matter transference he has developed a machine that he can use to make an object like a wrist watch or rodent disappear only to have that object rematerialize in a different location but there are those at his research facility that do not like or approve of his experiments and will do whatever it takes to see that he doesnt succeed after a failed demonstration that might have saved his funding professor steiner decides to test his machine on himself as expected things go horribly wrong and he is transformed into a heavily scared madman whose mere touch will kill  in hindsight maybe it wasnt such a good idea to rewatch the projected man in the same week i watched the fly return of the fly and curse of the fly there seems to be only so many movies about matter transference and the potentially horrendous effects it can have on the human body that one person should be made to endure in a three or four day period im not sure what those responsible for the movie list as their source material for the projected man but much of it is so similar to the fly movies that it cannot be mere coincidence however the projected man isnt even nearly as good as the worst of the fly trilogy  besides being terribly unoriginal the projected man has several other problems that really hurt the enjoyment of the movie a big issue i have is with bryant haliday in the lead hes such a horses ass that not only do i not care about his suffering i actually root for it supporting cast members mary peach and ronald allen are almost as bad theyre so bland and dull they hardly matter in fact theres very little to get excited about while watching the projected man the soundtrack  not very memorable the look  i would describe much of it as muddy the plot  predictable the action  there isnt any overall this is one to avoid  fortunately i watched the projected man via a copy of the mystery science theater 3000 episode funny stuff while not an absolute very often the poorer the movie  the better the mst3k riffs the guys hit almost all of their marks with the projected man ill give it a very enthusiastic 45 on my mst3k rating scale,negative,0
jaded offers a premise with potential as it looks at the rape of a woman by two other women and ask the question when is rape not rape unfortunately the flick seems to suffer from bad direction as it slogs through legal minutia while trying to weave some kind of story with a handful of foul mouthed and poorly portrayed characters only to end abruptly jaded is lame stuff only for the blearyeyed couch potato in the mood for some dark drama,negative,0

wwf survivor series 2001  this was among the worst events of 2001 perhaps its biggest flaw was the fact that it didnt follow suit to most of the previous survivor series there was only one survivor series match and that survivor series match went on for 45 minutes whats more anyone with a working brain would know that it would end with the rock versus austin and the rock prevailing for his team and dont get me started on the preview before the event no matter who won it was obvious that no one was going to fing die there was no need for all of that pointless hype whatever the storyline it was just a wrestling event  and as for the rest of the matches the first match was christian defending his european title against al snow it was a good fast paced match and its good to see a heel winning a match fairly william regal versus tajiri was boring and weve seen it 2 or 3 times before edge versus test was good but nothing great the tag titles steel cage match was the best match of the evening the battle royal went on for 10 minutes and no one really cared whod win in the first place the womens title match wasnt great no not in the slightest the main event must have been the most hypocritical match in history the alliance lost but guess what after 5 months every single alliance superstar returned the match itself was poor the rock eliminated 3 of them and jericho eliminated 2 the rock was too caught up with his acting to be there when the invasion began jericho was the one that jeopardised the whole match if i wanted any 2 to be eliminated in the early going it would be them everyone knew that kane big show and undertaker were just fall guys 7 matches isnt enough for a survivor series if theres ever a survivor series as bad as this again ill,negative,0

its obvious that the people who made dead at the box office love bmovie horror overt references to the genre are peppered throughout from stock characters the authority figure who doesnt believe the monstrous invasion is really happening to kevin smith style discussions to reenacting duane jones last moments from night of the living dead not once but twice  unfortunately it takes more than love to make a good movie  the staging and shot choice are unexciting and unimaginative while a common admonition in film school is to avoid mastershot theatre telling the story completely in a wide master shot here we find the obverse as in several sequences its hard to figure out the spatial relationships between characters as the story is told in a series of medium shots with no establishing shot to tie it together editing is drab and basic and at times there are unmotivated cuts the lighting is flat and sometimes muddy making the scenes in the darkened theatre hard to make out was there lighting or was this shot with available light only some shots are out of focus the dialogue is trite and the performances for the most part onenote isaiah robinson shows some energy and screen presence as curtis and the fellow playing the projectionist has some pleasantly dickish line readings michael allen williams as the theater manager and casey kirkpatrick as enthusiastic film geek eric have some nice moments the premise is silly even for a b horror flick also its too bad dr eisner was unaware of project paperclip  he couldve saved himself a lot of trouble the zombies are nonthreatening and their makeup is unconvincing although the chunky zombie trying to get a gumball out of the machine raised a smile for a zombie fan film there is very little blood or violence although what there is is handled pretty well the incidental music while stylistically uneven is kind of nice at times and there are some good foley effects the time warp parody was a fun listen although the images going along with it were less fun to watch unfortunately the looped dialogue sounds flat was this shot nonsync doubtful it looks like video through and through i watched the special introduction by troma films lloyd kaufman before the main feature  although it consisted essentially of kaufman plugging his own stuff and admitting that he hadnt seen the movie while someone mugged in a toxie mask its production and entertainment values were higher than dead itself quick aside to whoever put the dvd together  the countdown on film leader beeps only on the flashframe 2 not on every number plus one more after for that matter the vampire film theatregoers are seen watching early in dead looked a lot more entertaining than this recommendation to avoid unless you know someone involved in the production or are an ardent lloyd kaufman completist he plays kaufman the minion in the filmwithinafilm  full disclosure my girlfriend is an extra in this movie i swear this did not color my review,negative,0
a talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state allstar high school football game when he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a full ride scholarship if he plays well  all too often these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen full rides matt sabo certainly fits this profile but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre matt is the center of the action and he is a realistic teenager both overconfident and vulnerable optimistic and cynical by turns influenced by amy matt grows into a man of character and heart he in turn forms friendships with his teammates which influences his growth as an athlete and as a team player  full ride has all the elements we love to see in a moviegreat acting admirable characters exciting sports scenes poignant drama and a love story still while one may have seen these elements in other films full ride is assisted by performances that are sincere and occasionally even moving perhaps whats most impressive about full ride is its sense of reality although the author of the previous comment would seem to disagree clearly a disgruntled student who for quite obvious reasons received a poor grade in his film class director mark hoeger grounds the film in a believable situation and location and does a great job of getting down to the grit of what life is like in a small town these characters are real people rooted in realistic situations which often create the most compelling entertainment on one level it is a love story on another it is a character study and yet another it is a simple football film all of these ideas come together to form a cohesive vehicle,positive,1
i just dont understand why this movie is getting beatup in here jeez it is mindless it isnt polished and it is as i am reading wasted on some the cast of this movie plays their characters to the t if you watched permanent midnight and became a ben stiller fan then yes you will be disappointed these are misunderstood wellintentioned misfits trying to save the cityworld with nothing but grit and determination the problem is they dont realize their limits until the big showdown and thats the point this is 3 times the movie that the spy who shagged me was yet gets panned by the same demographic group likely the same people who feel the first ap movie pales in comparison to the sequel i just dont get it the jokes work on more then one level if you didnt get it i know what level youre at,positive,1
this film was just painful to watch not in the good dramatic way that makes you cringe with emotions for well developed characters in dramatic situations yeah i pretty much made that last sentence up as i went along but in just an absolute dull way for over two hours now you all may think im just some ignorant reviewer who has no respect for shakespeare or artistic filmmaking well youd be wrong on both counts i love the works of shakespeare especially the tragedies of romeo and juliet julius caesar macbeth and hamlet and ive watched plenty of arthouse films such as the surreal and wellmade eraserhead and fellinis 8 12 but this was just over two hours of lostintranslation shakespeare way too much nudity i can understand artistic nudity in some scenes but not in every other shot of a movie it was pointless and served nothing for the story and basically just overzealous filmmaking i had high expectations for this film in that it was said to be very artistic and was an adaptation of shakespeares the tempest but this was just an extreme letdown i gave this film a three only because of sir john gielguds acting presence which far surpassed all of the nonames in this film and the cinematographyset design combination as it made a lot of scenes look like paintings in motion however a lot of this film wouldve been better off as just a painting with a scroll of text below it a true disappointment maybe if zeffirelli had been given the directors chair this wouldve been much better but this is one audience members opinion many others may enjoy this far more than me that being said if you cant find this at any nearby video stores its currently not on dvd dont try to go too far out of your way to find it its not really worth it,negative,0
i first saw this film during and international film studies course i am a nontraditional student and perhaps for reasons of yearslived or wisdomaccrued appreciated the slow reflective pacing of the films narrative languorous with the heat and dust of an arid clime the story is deeply psychological replete with multilayered symbolism and an articulate inversion of the theme of being the other in a land that one does not understand the understanding that does come is fraught with the unresolved memories and subjectivity of the outsider made nearly 20 years ago it is also a forerunner in a genre of numerous other international films that explore the themes of colonials in colonized spaces clueless to the nuances of the cultures into which they have entered much more lavishly filmedand heavily financed works that have been made since reflect the same themes indochine nowhere in africa are two that in comparison perhaps make chocolat seem pale and boring it has no adrenalinepumping action or extreme violence the struggles are mental emotional and subtle but that being said it is a fine film worth a viewing,positive,1
this is a novelty in danish film the mood is not unlike that of blinkende lygter also by anders thomas jensen but with a novel touch one difference is fewer characters leaving much more room for them to be dwelled into and what characters the two butchers are perfect mads mikkelsen is a dominating deranged parody and nikolaj lie kaas an indifferent looser with a twin brother more or less an unholy pairing of the two,positive,1
i shall begin with a disclaimer this movie is not recommended for anyone who lack interest or have never played ff7 the game before watching the movie relies on the audiences knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements and it does so very subtly do your homework before watching this wonderful piece of cg film and i promise itll be that much better  with that in mind this film has some of the most spectacular cg sequences i have ever witnessed the whole experience felt like an extra long fmv sequence from the game on steroids yeah the attention to detail in each scene especially in the heavy action oriented ones is so impeccable it left me with a sense of awe  i believe the soundtrack is simplified so as to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music again for those who are familiar with the ff7 story and background the music should not surprise anyone although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhances the animation  once again i myself having only played through ff7 once thoroughly enjoyed this piece of art from square enix and that is the feel in most scenes choreographed and organized like a dance  in short if you enjoyed the music or the game final fantasy 7 this film will blow you out of the water if youre in the unfortunate majority who has not experienced the goodness known as ff7 on playstation or pc doing so before watching the movie will allow for an exponentially greater experience  finally i just want to make a note of the quality in animating this film characters move with fluidity each scene background comes to life and tells its own story for those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the story plot i urge you to reexamine the animation facial reactions subtle clues that bring about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot delivery  square enix and the great tetsuya nomura has set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling advent children has ushered in a new era for cg animations allowing the subtleties that lie in each character to speak volumes in and of themselves  thanks square enix the wait was well worth it,positive,1
there should be a rule that states quite clearly that movies like resident evil are supposed to be made in the spirit of the game not in the spirit of blowing up everything possible re was a survival horror game and a damn effective one at that yet paul ws anderson managed to make it like any other video game movie to come along alone in the dark is essentially the same kind of a spirit as resident evil so of course there is the slight hope the director will manage to have some piece of a brain enough to make a horror movie and not an action movie instead alone in the dark just proves that there is no longer hope for video games becoming movies  the plot despite the fact that it obviously isnt supposed to matter is the largest of many problems with the movie the movie starts with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important as after a minute passes the audience stops caring and just sits through the rest hitting the object closest to them then theres something about an orphanage some artefacts an ancient tribe some bureaucracy and some demons all of which get so jumbled together that the viewers really cant follow with what is going on characters move in and out of the plot like candy some having huge buildups for meaningless deaths basically what i can understand is that some demons got released and edward carnby slater has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his orphanage which has failed on him he finds an artefact involving the demons and brings it to an exgirlfriend anthropologist reid who of course he manages to have sex with right away for no good reason then out of nowhere all hell breaks loose and the pair end up with a military team led by some asshole commander dorff who apparently has a mutual hatred for carnby  its all ridiculous and the reason i dont really understand it isnt just because its complicated and jumbled but it leaves no room for anyone to really care instead i highly recommend that if you must see this film bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusion  the action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little right too bad this movie is like any other ruined crap ever made with enough quick cuts to behead a coop of chickens considering that this is based on a horror game not an action game it is especially annoying  the first action scene involving a man chasing cranby from a taxi is among the worst i have ever had to witness and the rest isnt all that great either the demons look somewhat cool though the fact that they turn into powder when killed takes away all that effect scenes involving lots of guns which should be cool to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only source of light and the camera zooming and panning faster than the head of a crack addict its all the kind of seizure inducing crap that keeps children in bed at night  the acting is what i like to call taking actors and making them do nothing slater does nothing but sound important for the whole movie though he does seem to have more talent than he is letting on the same is true of dorff who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent something that has happened to him a lot reid is pretty much exactly what she should be background sex appeal as whenever she tries to act it is a disaster as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginning  in all this is the type of movie that worries me about future video game movies if they keep ruining the spirit like this its only a matter of time before samus aran is killing middleeasterns with an ak47 and tommy vercetti is fighting a squadron of aliens unlike resident evil however this one doesnt deserve a second chance as i dont think anything could possibly help me forget just how terrible this movie is its bland uninteresting and unexciting this is the movie equivalent of diarrhea its all thrown together nothing really fits and in the end youre just glad its over  total 4,negative,0

oh yeah this one is definitely a strong contender to win the questionable award of worst 80s slasher ever made the prey has got everything you usually want to avoid in a horror flick a routine derivative plot that youve seen a thousand times before and better insufferable characters and terrible performances a complete lack of gore and suspense fuzzy photography and unoriginal locations and  most irritating of all  the largest amount of pointless padding footage youve ever encountered in your life and thats not an exaggeration but a guarantee apart from the seemingly endless amount of national geographic stock footage which ill expand upon later this film is shameless enough to include a complete banjo interlude  and two occasions where characters tell dillydally jokes that arent even remotely funny the setup is as rudimentary as it gets with the intro showing images of a devastating forest fire with ott voiceover human screams fast forward nearly forty years later when an elderly couple out camping in that same area get axewhacked by something that breathes heavily offscreen this ought to be enough information for you to derive that someone survived the fire all these years ago and remained prowling around ever since enter three intolerable twenty something couples heading up to the danger zone with exclusively sex on their minds unaware of course they are sitting ducks for the stalking and panting killer the prey is an irredeemable boring film apparently it was shot in 1978 already but nobody wanted to distribute it up until 1984 and it isnt too hard to see why in case you would filter out all the content that is actually relevant this would only be a short movie with a running time of 30 minutes possibly even less theres an unimaginably large of nature and wildlife footage sometimes of animals that i think dont even live in that type of area and they seem to go on forever the only thing missing in fact is the typical national geographic narration providing educational information regarding the animals habits animals in their own natural biotope are undeniably nice to look at but not in a supposedly vile and cheesy 80s slasher movie for crying out loud the last fifteen minutes are finally somewhat worthwhile with some potent killing sequences and fine makeup effects on the monster who turns out to be lurch from the addams family movies but still silliness overrules  the scene with the vultures is too stupid  and the final shot is just laughoutloud retarded as mentioned above the prey easily makes my own personal list of worst 80s slashers alongside appointment with fear berserker deadly games dont go in the woods hollow gate the stay awake and curfew,negative,0
whether one views him as a gallant cavalier of the plains or a glory hunting egomaniac debates about the life and military career of george armstrong custer continue down to the present day they died with their boots on presents certain facts of the custer story and has taken liberty with others  he did in fact graduate at the bottom of his class at west point and got this overnight promotion on the battlefield to brigadier general his record leading the michigan regiment under his command was one of brilliance  it was also true that his marriage to libby bacon was one of the great love matches of the 19th century libby and george were married for 12 years until the little big horn whats not known to todays audience is that libby survived until 1933 during that time she was the custodian of the custer legend by dint of her own iron will and force of personality her late husband became a hero because she would not allow him to be remembered in any other way  i think raoul walsh and warner brothers missed a good opportunity to have the custer career told in flashback olivia dehavilland should have been made up the way jeanette macdonald was in maytime and be telling the story of her husband and her marriage from the point of view of nostalgia and remembrance even then the cracks in the custer legend were appearing but if done from libbys point of view they could be understood and forgiven  sydney greenstreet gave a fine performance as general winfield scott the only problem was that scott had nothing whatsoever to do with custer he was retired and replaced by george b mcclellan in late 1861 while custer was still at west point im not sure they ever met but greenstreet does a good characterization of the ponderous and powerful winfield scott a nice mexican war story should have been what they gave greenstreet instead for his very accurate portrayal of old fuss and feathers  the film though is carried by one of the great romantic teams of cinema errol flynn and olivia dehavilland this was the last of eight films they did together the last scene they ever did for the cameras was libbys farewell to george as he leaves to join his regiment for what will prove to be his last campaign both their performances olivias especially was a high point in their careers at warner brothers we know through history that custer is riding to his doom that and the fact that this was their last screen teaming give this scene such a special poignancy if your eyes dont moisten you are made of marble   as history they died with their boots on leaves a lot to be desired as western adventure that successfully mixes romance with the action you cant beat this film at all,positive,1
admittedly before seeing house of wax i assumed it would simply be a second tier low quality teen slasher film following in the footsteps of such movies as the darkness or amityville horror after catching an advanced showing at my college campus i can honestly say that the people at dark castle have done an excellent job with the task of making a slasher   starting with the usual staples of a teenage horror film such as the small group of friends departing on a road trip coming across an odd detour taking them through country backroads meeting creepy locals after the slow but mandatory backstory this movie really reaches a fast clip paris hilton appears in this film as many already know but i really have to give it to her for her ballsy performance clearly her acting wasnt worth an oscar but the filmmakers use her appearance to its fullest by squeezing two blatant satires of her lets just say less noble media appearance into this film ms hilton also claims the title for the greatest death scene in the movie and not simply because it was her death scene  this movie is full to the brim with jumpy moments and cheap scares but jaume serra has definitely created quality suspense and tension between the characters the causes for the horror are in part based on making the audience care for the characters which we do by making the usual buildup followed with a loud noise and jerked camera some other scary moments these standard movie techniques adopted from many movies past are almost perfected with this film and provide many good scares in fact there isnt a slow moment after they get to the small town where the dreaded house of wax museum is   this film owes a lot to many previous movies of this and other genres though im not too sure how much came from the original 1953 movie of the same title references to such movies as both texas chainsaw masacres saw and even titanic see paris hiltons big death scene and youll know what i mean are common but in the end the payoff will leave you scared and fulfilled if you are looking for a good scare with a few laughs not bad,positive,1

the egyptian is set during the reign of one of the most fascinating figures of the ancient world the pharaoh akhnaton who thirteen centuries before christ attempted to introduce a monotheistic religion atenism to ancient egypt the main character however is not akhnaton but rather the fictitious sinuhe as a baby sinuhe is found mysteriously floating in a basket on the river nile and adopted by the physician senmut and his wife when he grows to manhood he follows his adopted father into the medical profession initially working as his father did among the poor of the city but he comes to prominence after he and his friend the ambitious young soldier horemheb save the pharaohs life while on a hunting expedition in the desert sinuhe is appointed court physician but becomes obsessed with the babylonian courtesan nefer sinuhe not only ruins himself in a vain attempt to win her love but is also disgraced when his neglect of his duties means that he is unable to save the life of akhnatons daughter  sinuhe flees into exile where he achieves success as a healer in neighbouring countries but returns to egypt when he learns of a hittite plot to invade although akhnaton readily forgives him for his previous offences sinuhe finds the country in turmoil the pharaohs attempts to introduce a new religion have led to civil strife between his followers and those of the priests of the old polytheistic faith and he is too pacific by nature to take any steps to confront the hittite threat sinuhe becomes embroiled in a plot by horemheb now the general of the egyptian army and akhnatons sister princess baketamon to overthrow the pharaoh and replace him with a more effective monarch  the films weaknesses arise mostly from its two romantic subplots in the course of the film sinuhe is revealed as the longlost son of the previous pharaoh and halfbrother to akhnaton and baketamon it might therefore surprise a modern audience that she should fall in love with him marriage between brothers and sisters were not necessarily considered as incestuous by the standards of egyptian royalty but the standards of 1950s cinema audiences were generally less liberal on this point in any case the horemhebbaketamonsinuhe love triangle is an unnecessary complication and detracts from baketamons role in the film that of the voice of coldeyed cynical realpolitik  the nefer subplot which takes up most of the first hour of the film is overwritten and excessively melodramatic nefer is morally worthless but fascinating and the role needed an actress of great beauty and also great dramatic skill to make her credible especially as nefer achieves the difficult task of winning sinuhe away from a woman as lovely as jean simmons who plays merit sinuhes rival for her affections it is therefore unfortunate that the role went to an actress as comically inept as bella darvi whose only qualification was that she was the mistress of the producer darryl f zanuck darvi was not only a wooden actress but also spoke with a thick foreign accent made even more incomprehensible by a lisp she was not even particularly attractive by comparison with the two legendary hollywood beauties in the film simmons and gene tierney who plays baketamon  the film is better when it concentrates on its main political and religious themes the other actors are better than darvi although peter ustinov as sinuhes servant kaptah makes the same mistake as in spartacus that of trying to bring comic relief into a film that does not need it his voice anyway was far too patrician for a comic servant role  edmund purdom a littleknown british actor was thrust into the main role when marlon brando pulled out at the last minute but more than adequately fills the great mans shoes even though his style of acting was quite different he copes well with the challenge of showing the changes in sinuhes character from unworldly idealist to lovesick fool to embittered cynic to the enlightened visionary of the final scenes victor mature was never the most expressive of actors but he is wellsuited to the role of horemheb a practical downtoearth man of action he is better here than he was in his other epic from 1954 demetrius and the gladiators simmons is luminously beautiful as merit  michael wilding hitherto best known to me as the second mr elizabeth taylor plays akhnaton as a wouldbe philosopherking who ends as a sort of holy fool his inability to make difficult decisions makes him an unsuitable ruler but he has a prophetic vision of peace and justice which lend him an air of moral greatness far beyond those who hope to replace him on the throne although aten had more in common with the supreme being of the deists than with the old testament jehovah or the trinitarian christian god there is a quite deliberate attempt to draw parallels between atenism and christianity in the film the atenist symbol is the ankh doubtless chosen because of its resemblance to a cross but in reality it was a common egyptian hieroglyph for life not unique to atenism akhnatons language often has a biblical ring to it his comparison of himself to wind whistling in the desert recalls john the baptists voice crying in the wilderness hence the title of this review sinuhes finding in the river parallels the old testament story of moses  at the end of the film sinuhe who has become the inheritor of the spirit of the dead akhnaton achieves a moral greatness of his own the message of the film is that while we may need practical men of action like horemheb we also need visionaries and thinkers who are

bruce almighty looks and sounds incredibly stupid especially from the trailers nevertheless i found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more bruce jim carrey is angry at god and is given divine powers by him to be god for a week to see if he can do a better job morgan freeman plays a man symbolized here as god and though it isnt his usual type of film or one of his best roles he does excellent with what he is given to work with although crude at times the film does have quite a few laughs from bruce parting his soup in half like the red sea and the customers reactions to him as well as freemans seemingly laidback and wisecracking image of god it is overly exaggerated at times and there is some crude humor but overall it manages to be somewhat funny there is a decent supporting cast such as jennifer aniston lisa ann walter and steve carrell which always helps the end of the film proves to be very romantic and tearjerking and the message is clear that we should do what god has called us to do and be the miracle the film is far from perfect but still enjoyable and far better than i and many people probably would have expected especially if we see the deeper message of the film   out of ,positive,1
no words can describe how awful this film is its like the director literally took a s in a roll of film and sent it out to the viewing public  the acting in this movie is horrendous the plot is so dumb and the deaths of each character is laughably bad some stupid scenes include akshay kumar pulling a gun out of nowhere to kill a hologram yes a hologram akshay kumar carrying a bazooka around the town rajat bedi getting beaten up by a poorly animated skeleton rajat bedi and siddharth double penetrating monisha korella how did they think this was straight also id like to point out that the animations are absolutely terrible the scene that supports this statement is when kapal has the motorbike and somehow gains the glasses the shopping job looks like it was done in microsoft paint  the best parts in this movie are with sunny deol this man is so strong that he makes even god feel scared in one scene he literally breaks open a jail door by kicking it chuck norris roundhouse has nothing on that he is even so powerful that he can fly from london to india in a matter of 10 minutes overall this movie is perhaps the most poorly made movie in the universe if you were to watch it watch it for the hilarity that ensues throughout btw this movie is supposed to be serious,negative,0
welltremors i the original started off in 1990 and i found the movie quite enjoyable to watch however they proceeded to make tremors ii and iii trust me those movies started going downhill right after they finished the first one i mean ass blasters now only god himself is capable of answering the question why in gods name would they create another one of these dumpster dives of a movie tremors iv cannot be considered a bad movie in fact it cannot be even considered an epitome of a bad movie for it lives up to more than that as i attempted to sit though it i noticed that my eyes started to bleed and i hoped profusely that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the tv and kill me did they really think that dressing the people who had stared in the other movies up as though they were from the wild west would make the movie with the exact same occurrences any better honestly i would never suggest buying this movie i mean there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well,negative,0
spoiler alert  this was the worst of the series it is horror disguised as political satire and it is as subtle as a sledge hammer not very scary and not very insightful did micheal moore have anything to do with this piece of garbage  im really sick of hollywood using entertainment as a political campaign against george bush and constantly repeating the same talking points over and over again this movie wants to be deathdream but unlike that movie which subtly poignantly tackled the problems soldiers who came back from vietnam by clever making the main character come back as a blood craving zombie and slowly built on this theme it was a true horror film that was also good social commentary because it didnt get sanctimonious exploitave and preachy  i guess joe dante thought this was trying to make a horror film to scare republicans conservatives and libertarians and me being the last in that list found this film to be totally ridiculous manipulative and exploitave all at the same time and i dont mean the good type of exploitative that you often find in the  drivein type movies i mean exploitative in the most sickening and vile manner using the deaths of our soldiers as a manipulative political statement disguised as a horror film   this film assumes that all the soldiers who died in iraq would vote against a conservative president if they would come back to life as zombies which is a flawed premise because as i recall for the most part and going by george romeros rules zombies are mindless flesh eating creatures operating on pure impulse and even though the zombie andy in deathdream could talk he couldnt really hold a conversation and he was driven by his addiction to human blood okay zombies are mindless creatures driven by impulse and not intellect and obviously they are dead so why would dead people be allowed to vote in the first place my interpretation of this film is that the only war a liberal democrat could win is by having mindless dead people vote for him i guess they meant to say the people that vote for presidents like george bush are the mindless zombies while the real mindless zombies are actually the ones making the intellectually sounds decisions yeah whatever dawn of the dead tackled this idea much better but user the idea of mindless consumerism this film isnt dawn of the dead by any stretched of the imagination  the film addresses the issue while the soldiers are alive that a majority of them voted for a bush like president but after they die they would vote for a liberal antiwar democrat after they are zombies who are normally considered brain dead creatures and laughably has them destruct after they vote  if you are gonna make a zombie movie mr dante and invoke george romeros name in it you better have mindless zombies that like ripping people apart and eating their intestines not zombies that vote i also like how the zombies just go evil conservatives who support the war  if you want a good movie with social commentary skip this poorly made preachy piece of junk and watch deathdream instead  the worst of the master of horror series hands down,negative,0
the movie frailty is actually more of a psychological thriller than it is a horror film it has all the trappings of a horror film but this it is not frailty is a film about perceptions of religion and realizing the differences between right and wrong  in frailty a middleaged father bill paxton and his two sons claim to be doing the work of god it turns out that they are a trio of notorious serial killers called gods hands we watch the father kill the demons in some rather brutal ways while convincing his sons and himself that they are doing the work god and that what they are doing is right he claims that he received a message from an angel who gave him specific instructions to eliminate the demons living here on earth god has given him a list of names and in return for his services he and his sons will be given protection which basically means the police will never be able to capture them we see all of this unfold in front of us in a very disturbing manner but what is really disturbing about it all is the effect that it has on the two sons particularly the oldest son adam adam himself seriously doubts the existence of a supreme being that is until his father and a week in the cellar changes all of that he knows that his father has obviously lost his mind and is pretty sure the same is happening to his younger brother fenton fenton the other half of this puzzle takes everything in as if it were his own religion he seems trapped in his fathers world of god and demons i suppose this is because hes so young and easily impressionable but everything that happens to these three is rather convincing in fact too convincing   the events that occur in the film can be looked upon as a vivid hallucination that is being experienced by the three main characters i say this because they each react to the situation in different ways and at one point in the film they each claim to see god dad first sees the murders as his mission his mission eventually consumes him and quickly turns into an obsession with eradicating demons in fact his hallucination is the primary one his orders and the list of names he receives are all a part of this hallucination watch the scene where dad finds the ax in a barn to figure out where i am coming from fenton the younger son is easily impressed by all of this talk of demons and destruction since he is so young its easy for him to fall into his fathers trap adam on the other is very skeptical towards his fathers actions   spoilers   in a way the hallucination ends when dad is killed towards the end of the movie i will not say how or under what circumstances but i will say that it is not pleasant after his death it fastforwards to the present day the story is being told through flashbacks as seen through the eyes of the oldest son adam in actuality it is fenton that is telling the story not adam as originally believed the story is being told the way he perceived it through his actions and his brothers actions fenton has gone insane and is continuing what his father started by luring the fbi agent into his trap  since religion is a major theme in this movie the film also plays on how easy it is for religion to be misinterpreted by those that do not have a full understanding of it before dad discovered his newfound mission he himself did not have a clear understanding of religion nor did he fully believe in a supreme being his sons fenton and adam often sang innocent little childrens church hymns but yet probably did not have a clear understanding of what the lyrics meant after the revelation of dads newfound mission they both took off in separate directions  adam remained in doubt of there being a supreme being while fenton was gradually sucked into his fathers madness   a very good thriller that will creep the heck out of you do not watch it alone,positive,1
an assassination thriller in the mould of day of the jackal in the line of fire has the added twist that eastwoods oldtimer bodyguard frank horrigan is troubled by past failure on the job the chase becomes personal as john malkovichs reptilian assassin leary taunts him over this neurosis  with the rather clunky exception of the love of a good woman russos lilly raines nothings going to set franks mind at rest than taking leary down personally  malkovich is a volatile presence  not simply combustible on screen but often a changeable actor too this is one of his good films focused and playing director petersens game eastwood is too old but a the audience dont care cos its him and b his age is written into the script not only in the narrative but also as a recurring joke pretty much as youd expect but wellhandled 710,positive,1

i cant really say what i think about this movie its against the guidelines ive watched many many films and this has got to be the worst one yet extremely low budget im guessing all the money went into the slaughter house scenes cause i could of did a better job with a bw 8mm camera and a crew of monkeys it was so bad i registered just to leave a comment cause i had to tell someone movie rental place wasnt enough but this is my 2 cents worth i suggest borrowing it from some poor sap who rented it and watch it yourself cause i sure wouldnt waste the money on it myself again now i leave you with this comment i hope your not made at the rental place when they wont refund you your money  ,negative,0
first of all blythe danner doesnt look anywhere near old enough to play capshaws daughter and in fact she isnt  only ten years apart  i understand this is supposed to be one of those magical moonstruck type supernatural romances but this is beyond the pale very very weak in terms of acting script and direction   the only one who really shines here is ellen degeneres who makes this film watchable  if not really believable herself as shes cast as a bit of a heterosexual sex hound but endearing nonetheless actually degeneres and the skin shots of the young guy capshaw dallies with together make this watchable but no one can really tell if capshaw is really in love with the young guy or not neither the script nor her acting pull it together for us and were left to wonder how she really feels,negative,0
once you can get over nic cage playing an italian soldier who loves opera and believes in making love not war you can get down to enjoying this beautifullooking film this could be used as an advert for tourism in the mediterranean john hurt is great and penelope cruz isnt bad as you might expect christian bales character is somewhat onedimensional which is a shame  the main drawback of this film is the adaptation from the book  having been told subsequently the differences between the book and film plots i feel cheated out of a much better and more convincing storyline,positive,1
having to have someone hold your hand whenever walk up or down stairs having others taste your food before you eat it facing an overbearing mother these are only a few of the obstacles which the young victoria has to deal with in this film theres also the various power struggles going on as well as attempts on her life needless to say it makes for very fascinating and informative viewing  i had only previously seen emily blunt in the devil wears prada and little else as she was in that film she is once again the standout here i was extremely impressed with her portrayal of the young victoria and thought she handled the role very well she makes the transition from the young victoria we meet at the start of the film to the queen victoria she becomes later entirely believable blunt is perfectly cast in the role showing all the different sides from the vulnerable to the strong from the young victoria who makes mistakes to the queen who takes control not enough can be said about emily blunt in this role shes  quite simply  exquisite commanding your attention every second shes on screen she keeps you transfixed up to and including the final shot of the film  rupert friend proves to also be wellcast as victorias love interest and eventual husband prince albert the actors have nice chemistry and you absolutely believe in their developing relationship they have their disagreements but you can tell that they are in love blunt and friend are excellent in every scene that they share and keep you interested in what is happening between victoria and albert the other actors in the film are also very good paul bettany as lord melbourne miranda richardson as the duchess of kent mark strong as sir john conroy and jim broadbent as king william there is not a single bad performance in this film the lessfocusedupon people are wellportrayed also given what little screen time they have even victorias dog a cavalier king charles spaniel named dash is memorable and makes an impact in the film  although the movie does tend to skip more than a few aspects of victorias life  especially at the end  and instead tells us what happened with her and albert on screen what matters the most is what we actually see this is after all a film about the young victoria not the middleaged victoria nor the old victoria while there are some embellishments made on history with this film it remains focused on what it sets out to do  which is tell us the story of how the young princess rose to power  the movie looks amazing the costumes emily blunt wears are visually stunning and the music only adds to the film never detracts from it its exceptionally shot and unlike a lot of films these days this movie is actually a good length as it doesnt run on so long that you lose interest or feel that its needlessly being drawn out  it goes without saying that what makes this film so great is emily blunt shes in fine form here turning in another excellent performance and elevating this film above what it might have been had another actress been cast in this rather importanthistoric role this is one finelycrafted film with excellent performances that should definitely be seen if you have an appreciation for a fascinating look at a woman who was extremely significant in history this is a mustsee,positive,1
travolta and thurman deserved a better movie this one is very secondary in all aspects not a single fresh idea but the biggest problem is this films ridiculous philosophy a gang of black rappers after all their criminal activities and even killing people are becoming almost positive mickey mouselike heroes performing on stage and giving away awards at the ceremony perhaps this matches the real life but showing it as a quite normal happyending is beyond my imagination whats wrong with shooting a couple of bad ukrainians if they are not politically correct  the show must go on that makes me think that hollywood writers have a big problem with separating good and evil even if the genre supposed to be a black comedy,negative,0
i should have listened i was warned and still i paid money for this after reading all the reviews after knowing the original is so bad its good and that part 2 does not fit into that category at all still even then i couldnt resist exactly what happened here part one was hilarious it had so much politically incorrectness and other crazy fat entertainment and this one there just couldnt possibly be a worse sequel on gods green earth not basket case 2 hell not even troll 2 this is truly the worst sequel in history and thats really saying something considering the groundbreaking bottom of the barrel qualities of the original criminally insane part 2 was just a completely different brand of bad shot on video zero score zero entertainment value 13 consists of flashbacks of the original and on top of all that crazy fat ethel has lost a portion of her girth i mean honestly is this some kind of sick joke thanks a lot nick milliard 11,negative,0
probably jackie chans best film in the 1980s and the one that put him on the map the scale of this selfdirected police drama is evident from the opening and closing scenes during which a squatters village and shopping mall are demolished there are clearly differences between the original chinese and dubbed english versions with many of the jokes failing to make their way into the latter the latter is also hampered by stars who sound nothing like their chinese originals in fact the only thing the dubbing has corrected is the court trialat the time trials in colonial hong kong were conducted in english while the original has this scene in cantonese  nonetheless chans fighting style and the martial arts choreography inject humour where possible so noncantonese audiences dont miss much its not after all the dialogue that makes a chan flick but the action and the painful outtakes the story is easy to follow chan plays an incorruptible hong kong detective pursuing a gangland godfather cho yeun and assigned to protect a star witness brigitte lin the action is superb from beginning to end and theres not much time to breathe in between itll never get you thinking but what an entertaining and well strungtogether film arguably this is one of the best martial arts films out there,positive,1
i wouldnt have given this film such a low rating 2 if its average hadnt been ridiculously high but someone had to bring it down to something more reasonable i sat through most of this film watching scene after scene of tagging and shoplifting no dialog just tagging and shoplifting finally the two taggers kissed something happened but then back to tagging and shoplifting i left the screening i recommend this film only to those who are impressed by pretentious filmmaking i disliked the directors previous film a selfrighteous defense of manboy love but at least that film had a story interesting characters dialog the graffiti artist had only scene after scene of tagging and shoplifting i want more from a film than this,negative,0

not that i was really surprisedmovies are never as good as the books that they originated from i was looking forward to seeing this movie because this is one of my favorite books even though i knew it would probably suck i was hoping to be pleasantly surprised however they strayed from the books storyline too much and the movie version did not convey how horrible this house really was ending was different too lara flynn boyle looked terrible due to some really bad cosmetic surgery the acting was unremarkable at best perhaps if a theatrical version was made so that they wouldnt have to stay so much in lifetimes made for tv movie box it would be a better flick if you saw this movie i highly encourage you to track down the book and read it i doubt youll be disappointed and hope you enjoy it as much as i do every time i read it,negative,0
the house of the spirits is a gripping tale of family intrigue south american politics and supernatural powers meryl streep glenn close and jeremy irons bring isabel allendes novel to life with all its passion and suspense this in my view is one of the best films of the 1990s jeremy irons as esteban trueba ages and mellows very believably while meryl streep in the role of clara maintains her gentle loving warmth throughout her relatively short life winona ryder and antonio banderas make a handsome couple struggling for family acceptance in a racist culture glenn close as estebans sister gives a very moving performance the countryside of portugal is a reasonable substitute for a nontropical latin american country settings of claras home and estebans ranch are effective and the period us cars add nicely to the postwar atmosphere,positive,1
simon pegg plays the part of sidney young a young entertainment writer who has begun the beginnings of a career writing for a grassroots magazine that specializes in badmouthing the shallowness and superficiality of the rich and famous he is making a career out of lampooning celebrities although he has a desperate wish to be a celebrity himself the movie is based on the very bizarre career of toby young who also ran a small magazine in britain called the modern review which offered scathing criticism of pretty much everything imaginable until he closed the magazine in a hail of verbal bullets with his coeditor and then went on to a spectacularly failed career as a writer for vanity fair which is pretty much the part of his life told in this movie   he is at first thrilled to go work for a major publication called sharps magazine in the movie and despite active nerves he is positively beaming on his first day he meets the chief editor clayton harding played by jeff bridges who is hard as nails but who is also exactly the kind of editor he needs to be for a goofoff like young to keep his job at the magazine he offers little in the form of immediate acceptance of young but he also has what can only be described as a liberal tolerance of youngs offthewall antics and inappropriate behavior   much of the comedy in the movie is derived from youngs misunderstanding of or indifference to the generally accepted code of public behavior and the peculiar etiquette involved in dealing with the rich and famous but sidneys reasons for acting in such a weird way and for giving outwardly offensive interviews is because he believes that he loathes the entire celebrity culture and it would seem he believes in that ageold saying  if you cant beat em join emand then beat em  complicating matters are two very different women there is a charming regular girl at the magazine named alison olsen kirsten dunst who at first is appalled by sidneys obvious arrogance and womanizing ways and a stunning model named sophie megan fox who represents the celebrity culture needless to say sidneys endless attack of superficiality and stardom is a superficial lust for sophie the one with the look of a star  sophie is stunningly beautiful its true but also comes across as having not a single thought rattling around in her head alison is a regular girl not very interesting or attractive but dunsts performance makes her a real person a relationship with her would have all the reality of a britney spears marriage and yet the movie retains some level of believability because despite how obvious this is we also feel sidneys pain in not pursuing her i felt it anyway  how to lose friends and alienate people has a pretty interesting premise and is full of honest satisfactory performances and although it turns into a bit of your standard romantic comedy by the third act it has a variety of welldeveloped and interesting characters danny huston for example gives us a great performance as alisons other love interest who pays homage to the big lebowski also starring bridges with his everpresent white russian one of my personal favorite drinks buying absolute and kahlua here in china costs the equivalent of about 350 but my kitchen is never without them   i am looking forward to the day when simon pegg will branch out a little bit because i love his films but i am completely unsure about his range he played a serious character in hot fuzz but only serious in relation to the lunacy surrounding him and ultimately went back to being himself again which he has pretty much been in shaun of the dead run fat boy run and now how to lose friends hes a rising star it will be interesting to see what else he can do,positive,1

with the dialogue in the dubbed version of this film i dont think that shakespeare is in any great danger this is the story of an ancient aztec mummy who has been disenfranchised his stuff has been taken and this really ticks him off he seems to know whos doing this even though hes a gyrating raving entity i loved the two dull men who tell the story of how the mummy was found and the doctor who is determined to destroy the creature there are all these scenes in this ridiculous graveyard full of cheap crosses and other junk theres a mausoleum where the mummy is kept i cant begin to reproduce the idiocy of this including a snake pit where the good doctor is thrown there is a door next to it so he can crawl out to the robot a mass of metal cans with a guy inside the dialogue is awful there are long pauses between speeches as if someone offstage is feeding them their lines i love the scene where the two little kids accuse their mother of going out at night she goes into this zombie state or something nonetheless if your looking for a film that you can laugh at and never takes itself seriously watch this have a couple beers first like a direct line from the mummys tomb watch this and your eyes will bleed and your breath will stink what more can i say,negative,0
this movie took my breath away at some points i simply loved it   i admit that the character dialogs and storyline could have been done a bit better but hey this is just a simple short story of a couple of guys trying to slain a dragon theres nothing more to it  the overall design atmosphere the beautiful landscapes its all just magical   theyve put a lot of love in this movie character designs were great and funny a bit tim burtonish if you like i can recommend this movie to anyone interested in great design displayed in a simple small but lovely story,positive,1
this is a great small film i say small because it doesnt have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions as in a john woo film great performances by roy scheider and the three bad guys john frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days the film is very easy to watch the story is more of a yarn than a washing machineinstead of everything going around and around it seems as though things just get worse as the plot thickens wonderful ending very positive i never read the elmore leonard book but it cant be much different from the film because it feels like im watching an elmore leonard movie,positive,1
i saw the greek tycoon when it first came out in 1978 i found it extremely boring i thought it was no better than a travelogue except for one thing for the first time in my life i realized why it would be good to be rich seeing the scenery off aristotle onassis yacht and getting my first real peek into the lifestyle of the rich and famous opened my eyes to paraphrase martha stewart it was a good thing funny i dont remember the sex scene i hadnt seen the movie since it was on the big screen and found the lovemaking session with the mistress memorable this time maybe because i was younger and single back then it was no big deal,negative,0
atlantis the lost empire has some of the best smoothest animation and cleverly written dialogue of any disney movie ive seen and i was convinced of that in the first 15 minutes i especially love don novellos voice work on vincenzo santorini and phil morris as joshua strongbear sweet too bad the whole film seems to move at about double the pace that would be appropriate  at least in the first act one important aspect of any disney movie is a satisfying antagonist  which atlantis doesnt provide hes average at best halfway through the movie theres a mediocre twist thats all its a great movie nevertheless everyone should check it out,positive,1
the 80s were not very kind to onetime major star charles bronson starting with 1982s death wish ii and ending with this truly gruesome film from 89 bronsons screenwriters seemed to be trying to top each other in progressive grossness dw ii left little to the imagination in its depiction of the rape and suicide of bronsons characters daughter a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in disgusting detail 10 to midnight was the sort of loathsome film that made you want to take a bath afterwards nothing redeeming about it other films like the evil that men do and the remaining death wish films from this period straddled the line between high camp and high barf with their earnest depictions of brutality and revenge im not sure if the producers usually pancho kohner got a kick out of showing a weary looking senior citizenaged bronson destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what but the shoddy craftsmanship and terrible scripts of these films usually destroyed what little energy they may have generated  kinjite  the last of these films  is fairly wellmade but truly takes the cake in cinematic wretchedness in this film bronson sodomizes a perverse john forces a pimp to eat his rolex watch allows a male prisoner to get raped by another prisoner makes incredibly xenophobic remarks among other things ive thankfully forgotten also depicted is the gangrape of a young japanese girl fortunately this was offscreen though wellimplied  what were people thinking when they made this film what was bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible films for anyone interested in his best movies check out most of the films he made in the 60s and 70s like the mechanic death wish from noon til 3 once upon a time in the west red sun the great escape the magnificent seven rider on the rain etc etc,negative,0
actually that video camera effect is just that its an effect a rather good one u dont know much about directing a film do you this film is in fact better than the original its great fun to watch made for tv doesnt need to follow any rules i find it hard to watch number 1 because of how he kills the first girl its disturbing and all the time we are routing for judd nelson to get away with it we as the viewers are on his side i hope one day we will see a 3rd cabin by the lake but i doubt it watching this film you can understand how real movies are made as this is sort of like a film within a film judd is one of the scariest villains ever and hes more realistic he doesnt just mindlessly chop people up like in other horrors,positive,1
piranha starts out as expected stupid white people going to discover new lands and exploit them i thought for a while it might be a cannibal film it starts off like so many others showing nothing but shots off untouched amazon rain forest for all i know it could be florida at this point you figure some animal mutilation or natives will pop up instead you get the acting talents of william smith who starred in la vice and angels die hard he plays caribe an acclaimed hunter who i would describe him as jack palance light he is bigger in stature but not quite the jack palance goodness as for natives you dont really get that many wheres the piranha should i even ask that question caribe now hunts humans i guess he doesnt really pursue anyone till the end of the movie though just stares at them caribe does race one of the tourists on a motorcycle in a overdramatic smokey and the bandit kind of way the motorcycle challenge happens for no real reason other than an action sequence i cant tell you how many times ive seen a tourist challenge a stranger to a motorcycle race in the jungle never actually do they live do they die will you care anybody wanna race on motorcycles caution this film contains extreme dry look my advice is to rent a jack palance classic like craze,negative,0
i voted this a 10 out of 10 simply because it is the best animated story i have been able to see in quite some time the animation is stunning the artwork behind each and every landscape was beautiful from the colors to the lighting to the not standard fare of artistry i was amazed moving beyond the beauty on the screen you are immersed in a storyline that is at once timeless and at the same turn fresh character development is brief yet these touchstone moments are exactly what is needed to clue the viewer in to what and why and how the character has come to where they stand im impressed with the entire affair and think this is a must see for the entire family,positive,1
id have to say this is one of the best animated films ive ever seen i liked it the first time but really appreciated it on the second viewing just a few weeks ago i can see why sequel is doing such great business at the box office apparently a lot of people liked this movie  a gorgeous color palette man this looks good and a lot of good adult but clean humor make this a big winner the opening 34minute scene with scat is excellent as are subsequent interludes with him sid the sloth voiced by john leguizano however provides the main humor in the movie he usually has something funny to say throughout the movie  ray romano is the voice of the mammoth the big character of the film literally while denis leary is the ferocious badguyturnedgood sabertooth tiger  this isnt just humor and pretty colors but a nice sentimental story of how a little baby softens up a couple of tough characters this isnt interrupted with a lot of songs either one only brief one and there is nothing offensive languagewise  if more animated movies were this good id own more,positive,1
i think this is a great version i came on here before to help me find which version i should use and i went to jane eyre 1983 and read a comment from users comment and then helped me to get this version i do not regret picking this version and neither will you i tried watching all the other versions and none matched up to itthere is nothing like the bookand trust me if you are reading the book you want something that is going to match up with it when you are looking for something real and moving after you have read the book it is hard because you want something that is going to match up with that i would say god personally led me to this version it points to true love for a humans i would say gods love is greaterif there is anything better i would like to see it but so far there is none like it,positive,1
the thing viewers will remember most is the bad headache the movie has given them due to the overly flashy shaky camerawork and the fast confusing cutting i am not against those kind of stylistic devices if they are done right like oliver stone and steven soderbergh proof with most of their movies but in this case there was way too much it seems like the jumpcuts and light flashes that accompanied every flight over mexico city and every important scene were there to distract you from realizing that the story is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictable the biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily figure out how the whole thing is going to end for a movie that pretends to be violent ruthless and morally corrupt it is inexcusable that its story has been told so many times and with a lot more depth and character development that is another disappointing aspect of the movie if i want to watch an over the top action flick i do not need any justification but this movie tried to justify the killing spree of denzel washingtons character and poorly failed in delivering any believable performances the first half hour or so nothing much happens except that dumb archetypes and clichés are portrayed and when the action machine starts rolling it is so quickly cut that you do not know what really happens so the movie does not work either on the level of a believable dramathriller  nor as a pure action movie of course the movie is not as bad as some oft the totally messed up blockbusters of the last years but i absolutely cannot understand why so many people claim this movie to be something fresh and so cool for a video clip it is way too long and for a movie it has too little substance,negative,0
there is really no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made anything like it and no one ever will and it really should be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated at the very least it deserves to be seen with a great sound system  i saw this movie on the day it opened in 1968 my senior year in high school i went because i like sciencefiction and wanted to see a space movie remember this film was made before the first moon landing  there we sat waiting for it to begin but surprise there was no cartoon no coming attractions the theater owner at the cooper theatre for some reason chose to play the starspangled banner with the lights still up so we all stood never did that at a movie before or since and then sat down again as it ended then the theatre went completely dark and the strange overture began with the blank screen barely visible  the overture ended and my seat began to vibrate as the blue screen with the mgm lion appeared along with the first deep bass notes and then my senses were overwhelmed hearing also sprach zarathustra for the first time in my life the ride had just begun  i highly recommend you watch this opening this film in a dark room with your subwoofer turned up as high as possible to get the effect i felt in that theatre of course it took quite awhile before we got to outer space and the movie that followed was anything but a sciencefiction movie intermission came a good thing highly underrated and unused these days and we all looked at each other in wonder caught our breath and then the ride resumed wilder than before  i saw it 7 more times within the next year always in a real full size theater like all theaters were before multiplexes i might have been high once but i didnt go to see it again and again because i was tripping i went because i knew i was seeing a work of art it was so damn beautiful the sound that you could feel in your bones followed by terrifying silence the sights unimagined and unimaginable the affection for hal turning to terror and of course wtf was kubrick really trying to get across to me years and years and many more viewings later i understand it as well i think as i ever will read someone elses comments if youre looking for someone to explain it to you or search around the web youll find explanations thats not my purpose in writing these comments  what i hope to do is encourage you to watch it patiently enjoy its beauty the way you would enjoy watching a sunset while listening to the most beautiful music you know of eg gayne ballet suite or the blue danube savor it like you would a wonderful meal sip it like a fine wine look and listen for the clues and the hidden symbols that are there and then draw your own conclusions stanley kubrick wanted to share some things with you that he found beautiful and he wanted you to think about where you a human came from and where youre headed  if thats too much work for your brain and you cant see and hear and ponder the beauty and mystery of kubricks film then pardon my bluntness but your life is about as meaningful as that of a tapir or a premonolith ape if you want mindless escape this isnt for you  but if you like sunsets thunderstorms harmonies in music mysteries and sensuality and can have an open mind this film will add something to your life,positive,1
i just found the entire 3 dvd set at walmart in the bargain bin for 550 so i thought i would take another look total of 13 hours to watch it all 26 episodes i was born in 1948 and saw most of them on tv in the sixties many independent stations repeated them for many years  better than i expected actually time has been kind to the obvious sincerity of its creators and to the obvious gratitude and respect they give to all the allied fighting men and women more abstract and arty than a straight forward documentary but very truthful in its depiction of the causes and final results of wwii that war was greatly dependent on sea transportation and the final victory was dependent on who achieved the final mastery of the worlds oceans the allies were the ones who were able to do it  interesting too to see how they try to strike a balance between big events and the individual soldiers and sailors that made them happen the score is impressive if a bit too much by todays standards i read somewhere that robert russell bennett contributed just as much as richard rodgers to final score i imagine that rodgers provided all the major themes and it was up to bennett to fit them to the images great job  should be seen by every ruler or potential ruler a warning to tyrants that wars are eventually won by ideals determination and the supplies to back them up logistics their quality and delivery will determine the eventual victors the allies outproduced and surpassed the material quality of the axis attacked their very source in the process and insured their eventual defeat  sorry to see that the producer henry salomon lived a very short life imdbs facts were rather skimpy i have to find out more about him he did a few more outstanding documentaries before his early death might have more to say at a later time  trivia i had all 3 lp records made of the background music pretty good overall unfortunately the producers decided to add sound effects to the last one relegating immediately to just novelty status rather than for serious music listening too bad too because it contained some interesting but more minor themes in the series silly stuff like 16 inch guns firing torpedoes being fired bulldozers planesjust for kids mainly  rsgre,positive,1
i love it when they actually do a sports story well so many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to watch not this one its just a genuinely nice movie an oldfashioned type of story  and based on a reallife guy to did exactly what dennis quaid did in this film he plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out late in life athleticallyspeaking to become a pitcher in professional baseball eventually he reaches his goal of making it to the major leagues even if it was a very brief stint  all the characters in here are nice people the kind you root for from quaid to the players on his high school team to his little boy angus t jones now somewhat of a star on television  quaid is believable in playing jim morris because unlike actors in the past in sports films he knows how to throw a baseball he looks like a pitcher a guy who could fire it 90plus miles per hour and most of this film is true as testified by the reallife pitcher in one the documentaries on the dvd  so if youre looking for a nice inspirational true life sports film you cant wrong with this one,positive,1

after watch this movie i was surprised that someone had like it i think this is the worst comedy i ever seenever if you think you had already seen the worst comedy made wait for watch this crap not funny at all ok one or two laugh maybebut you have to be really high the acting is terrible and the story doesnt exist even if you like snowboarding  and i really do you will hate this movie ok ok you can see some nice babes  some nice snowboarding tricks and some beautiful mountains but thats all watch a porno set in the mountains instead because the acting and the story line might be better sometimes in imdb i read bad review about some movie and at the end they are not so awfulbut this one believe meis pure trash dont waste your time and money in this one,negative,0
i like steve buscemi i like his work very much both as an actor and a director you could say that i am into steve buscemi a steve buscemi freak i lurv steve buscemi  i remember when i first saw buscemis full length directorial debut trees lounge i enjoyed the movie although it wasnt as good as it could have been it was almost there it almost scratched that itch the itch of wanting to see small movies about small people in small bars that are in small towns it was close enough to where i would say that it was a very good movie  one that with a few tweaks could have been great but thats ok i like the movie and ive watched it more than once  but this review is not about trees lounge its about lonesome jim when i saw the description of the movie and then i saw whos movie it was i was excited at the prospect of finally seeing the movie that i knew that trees lounge could have been but what i actually experienced was not unlike that of leaving one of those smalltown bars with a belly full of cheap whiskey and an armful of cheap floozy heading back to your apartment with a mushy brain full of exciting prospects that inevitably disintegrate into the reality of alcoholinduced impotence and headspinning regurgitation  in other words this movie left me flat and unrequited and sorry that i wasted the time and the money that it took me to get to that state  the film equivalent of waking up next to that cheap floozy the next morning or if you happen to be the floozy waking up next to that stinking and farting and unshaven imbecile the film had all of the substance of a stale white bread sandwich with store brand white bread no less and the emotion of a cadaver i am not sure what the point of this film was and since it was supposed to have some sort of a point and was not an exercise in abstract surrealism that can get by without one then this lack of a point is a sin of omission sorta like those new cars that dont come with ashtrays anymore although there are millions of people who smoke and buy new cars im not one of them but hey i can sympathize overall it was a boring film about boring people doing boring things and had none of the grit and believability that can carry and save such a film i mean trees lounge was about boring people doing boring things but it was interesting   i blame a lot of this on affleck why do people keep casting these affleck turds they suck the life out of anything that they are connected with one affleck was in one decent film and wasnt even the reason why the film was decent and all of the sudden every butthole named affleck is stinking up as many films as they possibly can and liv tyler is no better being the daughter of a rock star does not necessarily make an actress she is as lifeless as affleck these people simply do not rise from the flat page of the script people pay to see films and they deserve to see actors and actresses with a bit of charisma  these two duds together dont have the spark of the old guy who hands out shopping carts at wal mart i always thought that steve buscemi was the type of guy who would rise above this type of pablum but oh steve you let us down this film makes me want to stuff you into another wood chipper,negative,0

this movie is like porn with all of the good parts removed its like all of the porn stars that didnt want to fulfill their obligations banded together around this awful trite useless piece of gargoyle abstinence  this is a helpful movie if youre in the mood to torture a loved or no longer loved one its important that if you choose to use this movie as a method of torture that you put in earplugs and put on a blindfold to keep yourself from going insane  if i had a choice between this movie and the 700 clubid choose girls gone wild  overall better if youve been drinking but only because it becomes a drinking game of epic proportions,negative,0

when it comes to the erotic genre im lucky to get through the first 20 minutes of the plot without getting up or looking for something else to watch this movie is different julie davis i love you dont touch me directed two very strong lead actors kira reed and doug jeffery in this enthralling thriller kira is convincing as kim a sweet innocent romance novelist that gets caught in the web of seduction of doug jefferys the man a handsome stranger kira loses control of her inhibitions in the role and as actress giving what could have been simply another t and a depth and believability i believe it to be her best performance yet and julie davis direction is a great gift to erotica,positive,1
i work at a movie theater and every thursday night we have an employee screening of one movie that comes out the next daytoday it was the guardian i saw the trailers and the ads and never expected much from it and in no way really did i anticipate seeing this movie well turns out this movie was a lot more than i would have thought it was a great story first of all ashton kutcher and kevin costner did amazing acting work in this film being a big fan of that 70s show i always found it hard thinking of kutcher as anyone but kelso despite the great acting he did in the butterfly effect but after seeing this movie i think i might be able to finally look at him as a serious actor  it was also a great tribute to the unsung heroes of the us coast guard,positive,1
not really sure what to make of this movie very weird very artsy not the kind of movie you watch because it has a compelling plot or characters more like the kind of movie that you cant stop watching because of the horrifically fascinating things happening on screen although the first time my wife watched this she couldnt make it all the way through too disturbing for her runs a bit long but nonetheless a worthwhile viewing for those interested in very dark movies,positive,1
unlike others i refuse to call this pitiful excuse for a movie a triumph of style over substance i dont want to give style a bad name still its the most apt description that comes to mind  a pointless unpleasant and ultimately meaningless assault on the eyes and ears wonderland leaves one wondering only why the film was made in the first place and who in their right mind gave the greenlight to this dreary and tangled mess a biography of porn star john holmes a study of who the man was why he went into the business and how it affected him great bound to be compelling bound to be entertaining bound to be enlightening and fascinating on about a million levels and i have zero interest in porn  but a confusing violent rashomonstyle study of a series of murders holmes was connected with after his career ended who in hell cares what insights do we gain this film completely ignores the most interesting aspect of john holmess life  that he was a porno star wonderland might as well have been about anyone the fact that the main character is the most famous male adult film star in history is almost irrelevant  to make matters about a thousand times worse the picture is loaded down with jerkoff gimmicks  annoying machine gun editing sloppy dogme95 camerawork unnecessary splitscreen graphics and animation etc etc  in the absence of a compelling story and unique main character the director and i use the term loosely has thrown together a dozen or so techniques from other films and decided to call the resulting mess a movie among these the trendy bleachbypass look of narc or traffic or minority report the frantic often incomprehensible throwthepiecesoffilmintheair cutting style of natural born killers or 28 days later the filleverymomentofsilencewith anoldsongtoevoketheperiod soundtrack of goodfellas or blow the groovy retro title sequence of velvet goldmine or autofocus or catch me if you can the list goes on and on and on pathetic  i wanted to like this movie i had real hopes for it wonderland avenue had been around for years had the context of the murders been emphasized rather than the murders themselves i think it could have worked had the murders and holmess growing involvement with seedy la types signaled the end of a career or the end of the swinging 70s i think the film could have had meaning it could have served a purpose as it is  meaningless pointless who cares how many perspectives exist on a series of murders generally unknown by the public the case isnt famous enough to merit such painstaking examination  this film should have been the third act of the john holmes story thats it period and it could have worked whats that oh right right they didnt want to tell a traditional riseandfall story they didnt want to make boogie nights or goodfellas or star 80 or autofocus they wanted their film to be different right  well in one sense they succeeded theres a big difference between those films and wonderland the difference is those films are good  ,negative,0

i doubt much of this film is based on a true story at the beginning it says based on a true story sort of i bet the only truth to it was there was an exmodel turned bounty hunter possibly named domino  anyways it begins with domino talking to lucy liu who works for the fbi domino is being interrogated about what she knows about a theft of 10 million dollars through flashbacks we see domino as a child then as a model and how she became interested in being a bounty hunter she basically tells 2 other bounty hunters off ed and choco they let her join the group shes tough can use any kind of weapon and will use her good looks if needed  they get involved with a scam that clarmont a bailsman has going along the way the group starts a reality tv show and thats where ian zering and brian austin green become involved they are sort of like hosts and must have been really desperate to appear in this  i thought the story was entertaining and it had some laughs the editing didnt bother me theres also a lot of violence mainly using guns and blood it could have been a little shorter  final verdict good enough to watch,positive,1

the location of the shop around the corner is precisely stated at the start of the film balta street in budapest but it could really be in any place the small number of sets reflect a middle european design but it could be a shop around any corner the film is not about budapest or the retail leather goods business but about the ups and downs of love reflected in most of the main characters  alfred kralik and klara novak are sparring partners at work but their anonymous letters to each other are full of hope and aspiration and romance and the story unwinds to bring these two aspects together beautifully hugo matuschek the owner of the shop is having trouble with his wife she only a voice at the end of the phone ferencz vadas has a secret affair ilona novodny has a gentleman friend who buys her fur garments mr pirovitchs life is centred around his wife and children pepi katona plays santa claus to a girl at christmas you even sense that quiet flora katchuck while staying at home with her mother dreams of someone  the script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama it moves effortlessly from scene to scene it is one of those quiet films that repays looking at again and again simple yet profound the dialogue reflects the character speaking which is not common these days   all the acting is magnificent even the minor characters like the waiter in the cafe and the policeman in the street are perfect james stewart and margaret sullavan play off each other perfectly he was really getting into his stride as an actor then and gives a sweet and sharp performance margaret sullavan was a terrific actor and under appreciated these days some of her other films are worth catching as mr matuschek frank morgan is amazing his moment of truth is very moving gold stars all round to the performers  it is a well worn phrase that they dont make them like they used to the vague remake youve got mail was dire but in this case it is true the director lubitsch is not in farce mode thankfully but delivered a classic film of spirit charm and warm humanity,positive,1
the third and last film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear it is a political film more than a plain entertainment jason bourne will finally know who he was and he will discover and remember the tortures he was submitted to in order to kill his old identity he really killed some one who became his corpse but the film is finally revealing that all this had been organized and planned by the cia within a blackfriars program that is also clearly revealed in this film as aiming at eliminating all american citizens who tried to prevent the control of the whole society by an established and limited group of people who was one essential officer of the cia up to 1980 when he became vice president that goes along with what is being said on the internet then the truth will come thanks to jason bourne himself but the main person who will be able to bring that truth to the public and the only authority that can take a decision concerning the cia is a woman and that woman gets the senate involved in a general investigation a woman and the senate read my lips in the usa politics are fought in the media and two media are essential for any presidential campaign it is music and the cinema right now hollywood and beyond the intelligentsia academia and intellectuals are using the cinema in general and this film in particular to build up the idea in the public that salvation will come from a woman and from the senate so go and watch the film it is pretty entertaining and it has the sweet fragrance of the end of a period and of the great change some are expecting and others are waiting for but no one is able to pretend it wont come the only point is to know how deep and serious it will be  dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne  university versailles saint quentin en yvelines,positive,1
now i like victor herbert and i like mary martin and allan jones but it would have been nice to see a real biography of victor herbert walter connolly as herbert does have a decent resemblance to him in his latter years  jones and martin sing beautifully though the herbert music is just there to adorn the plot line concerning these two musical performers joness john ramsay is a frail character very similar to gaylord ravenal in showboat who jones also played  as for mary martin its a mystery why she never had a good hollywood career she did films with bing crosby and dick powell as well as this one she performed well but movie audiences didnt take to her the best musical moment in the film is jones and martin in a duet of thine alone the recordings i have of the song are individual and it was written as a duet theres also a pleasant scene with jones and martin riding bicycles swapping herbert songs as they ride  the real victor herbert with his womanizing and his irish patriot background and his musical training in germany where he developed a love for all things german would have been a fascinating study he was also a cello virtuoso before he turned full time to composing i have to take strong exception to the reviewer who said cuddles sakall would have been a good victor herbert sakall as irish hello  nice movie but the real vic would have been so much better,positive,1
debra wingers 1987 black widow is much better  this is like a lame version and jane seymour usually does better  chad allen is pretty poor in this too just playing his usual role as a boring rebellious child  maybe the both of them being from dr quinn was supposed to make us get excited  if its on go grab a copy of black widow,negative,0
i have just finished watching this film and i can honestly say that this is a work of art i was very surprised to see the overall rating as 52  not only does guy bring together a b listish movie cast and make them into such glorious characters he has given us a movie with a fantastically diverse story line with much left to the imagination  far too many people are wanting movies with a plot that can be understood and handed to them on a plateyet these are the films that get poor reviews because they are far too predictable  this film is special get it now,positive,1

with ralph bakshi most of his films appear to be like twoedged swords youll get something awesome out of it but only if you put up with the silly and the unnecessarily cheezy the lord of the rings was a great adaptation of the story which perhaps didnt always shine in the animation department  fire and ice is a great achievement from bakshi from an animation point of view the rotoscoping is a lot more detailed and the animation has a vibrant look to it you still get some of the dull stillcells and slightly blurred background paintings but on the overall the look has definitely gotten better since bakshis last fantasy epic the animation has almost a realisticnaturalistic style to it and unlike in lotr where this style was often at odds with the actual content here it enhances the films unique atmosphere  unfortunately the film fails to create a meaningful story out of its simple setting and in fact most of the characters motivations are pretty blurred lorn and tigra are easy cases but even the main villain necron was difficult to follow not to mention that guy with furry face mask also known as just that guy even though most of the voice actors were appropriate there are some odd quirks in the audiodepartment and tigra especially sounds really terrible whenever shes screaming  however i believe the films inherent entertainment value outweighs its unnecessarily silly execution of the plotline the scant clad of the characters is something youll never get over but it helps you remind yourself that perhaps this film isnt even intended to be taken too seriously its still a hella cool and really funny,positive,1
i loved this movie i knew it would be chocked full of camp and silliness like the original series i found it very heart warming to see adam west burt ward frank gorshin and julie newmar all back together once again anyone who loved the batman series from the 60s should have enjoyed return to the batcave you could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this film especially adam west and ill bet he would have gladly jumped back into his batman costume had the script required him to do so i told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it now they wished they had i have all of the original 120 episodes on vhs now this movie will join my collection thank you for the reunion adam and burt,positive,1
this littleknown comedy from the hit play by ruth gordon is a delight the script based on the play is spicy rich and completely undated ditto the cast but i must underline the work of the leading ladyirene dunne irene is simply superb  as usual  and lights up the screen with every frame shes in and shes in it a lot thank heaven in addition director vidor has given her some unusual closeups that are mesmerizing what a gal i know of no other hollywood actress from any era who has her versatility and is so convincing in every film why she remains so little known is a mystery i have seen most of her films and this one was a surprise even for a solid id fan like myself see it everyone,positive,1

sure i like some indie films a lot actually i dont always understand them and thats okay not all of them were meant to be understood especially by mainly mainstream people like me im probably showing my ignorance but im still puzzled why book of revelation is called that i love those endofworld stories and the only thing i could see similar to the end of the world and this film was the torture it took to get through this im not talking about the subject matter perhaps ive been subdued from all the other tortureporn ive seen it was just the incredibly slow story one hour 15 minute material stretched for nearly two hours major spoilers lie ahead heteroman dancer gets abducted seduced and raped six ways from sunday or in this case 12 days by three hooded women upon his release after his somewhat distraught dancergirlfriend barely flinches other than dropping a glass after wondering which she missed more him or the cigarettes she originally sent him for upon abduction still in a state of reasonable shock he refuses to talk and she goes on to work without so much a hug as if nothing happened and he takes a well needed shower problem as much as hes tormented through the flashbacks to his uh attacks hes as equally aroused granted i havent been bound and used as a plaything but i doubt i would really be in the mood oh i forgot and how does he try and solve this crime sleep with as many women as he can to try and spot the birthmarks or tats the criminals had i see where theyre going with it  show a gang rape from the male pov fine twist notwithstanding you could never feel for this guy only saving grace was the good acting of the lifetimetv dancercancer instructor but even she couldnt save the film,negative,0

if i watch a movie and dont once look at my watch or clock to see how much longer it will be running or when i hope that the last scene wasnt the end of the movie its got to be pretty good im not an movie internalist or cinema dissectionist i watch movies and if they keep me interested till the end then they are pretty good because some of the most critically acclaimed films bore me to death the english patient shakespeare in love atonement crash this movie kept me interested and absorbed beginning to end acting is great story is absolutely original flashback technique very affective there was a bit of citizen kane thrown in tho when hoffman trashes his apartment after tomei leaves him but i forgive that cause i see it as a homage to rather than a ripoff of orson,positive,1
i saw this when i was 17 and havent seen it since the cbs late movie used to show it on a regular basis at one point i remember how sad and upsetting it was it truly made me sick to my stomach effects then werent what they are today but nevertheless it conveyed the feeling of being alone in the amazon after losing both parents and searching for a way out very well i remember the bugs and maggots the most so realistic they were eating her flesh its a dark film which was controversial subject matter at the time even though likely it was strongly edited for tv i wish i remembered more details and if i ever get the chance to see it again i can comment more i have been looking for this for years i believe it may have been shown on cbs under yet another title i have no idea whether it was ever released on video,positive,1
i am a fan of randolph scott westerns while some of them are amazingly clichéd as are most westerns of this era his easy delivery and style really elevate the films to classic and nearclassic status while this film features yet another example of real life western heroes being exploited after their death by hollywood in this case bat masterson the film works well due to him as well as excellent supporting characters one is the always strong acting of robert ryanan excellent actor who is sadly almost forgotten today the other is the ubiquitous gabby hayes who has one of his best roles as the crusty and very colorful deputy here he is more enjoyable than in his many supporting roles for roy rogers and john waynemostly because his part is better written and hes given more to do  the plot is pretty much the plot of half the westerns ever made there are some baddies who hire a bunch of thugs to run roughshod over the locals and its up to a dogooder scott to restore the peace and kill off the villains however how the plot is executed is much better than average and due to this the film is still watchable fun just dont expect a whole lot of innovation or uniquenessunless you want to see what might just be gabby hayes best performance,positive,1
steven speilbergs adaptation of alice walkers popular novel is not without its share of controversy when first released members of the black community criticised its treatment of black men while others questioned why a white man was directing this film about black women  this is the story of a young black woman named celie growing up in rural america after the turn of the century she has two children by her abusive father which are snatched from her arms at birth her only solace in her miserable life comes from her sister  celie played in later years by newcomer whoopie goldberg is married off to an abusive husband danny glover the husband is humiliated by the sister and so she is quickly removed from celies life  the story is often heartbreaking as celie keeps up hope that she may one day be reunited with her sister and with her children throughout her life she meets an assortment of characters including sophia a tough as nails wife to her step son and shug a loud and luscious saloon singer who teaches her a thing or two about love  speilbergs direction is all over this picture which offers brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances i dare you to watch this film and not be moved the film the color purple manages to capture the essence of what is a complicated story while it tends to minimise the lesbian aspects as well as the african story both of which were so vivid in the book the movie remains true to its themes allowing the voice of alice walker to shine through  i couldnt begin to respond to the controversy that surrounded this film suffice it to say however this is one of the few films that i can watch again and again and which has left an indelible mark on me  ,positive,1
this movie is tremendous for uplifting the spirits  every time i watch it i see  hear funny little things that i missed before  the soundtrack is unbelievable mick jones foreigner and chris difford squeeze penned the songs making strange fruit the best thing that ever hit todays music scene  unfortunately strange fruit are a strictly fictitional washed up 60s to 70s band that were never good to begin with due to drug use and inner fighting one wonders what might have been while listening to their fanatstic soundtrack  the fruit draw inspiration from the rolling stones deep purple david bowie and the who  each member of fruit are quite memorable stephen rea stars as downanddeadbroke tony costello who is asked by a festival promoter to reunite his band for a reunion tour with hopes of reaping monetary benefits costello haply approaches exroadie karen knowles played by juliet aubrey to help him rekindle the flame of a dream long past  juliet gathers up the bitter jimmy nail les wickes blundering timothy spall david beano baggot and extravagantly glamouresque ray simms bill nighy tumbling in is another exroadie the hippytokerjokester hughie billy connolly who never let the flame burn out  as juliet searches for the last member of their motley band the elusive guitaristsongwriter brian lovell played by the brooding bruce robinson the reunited members squabble just like old times fighting over each others rusty talent  the band is then given the chance to do a small dutch tour to prepare for the festival with young hendrixlike luke shand hans matheson taking the place of lovell the crew hits the road the sparks fly as their memories flame forward threatening to burn their unfinished goals  be prepared to laugh sing cheer and cry as these memorable characters etch themselves back into your hearts,positive,1
but quite dated today otto preminger made this movie without the certificate of approval that was needed then it was enormously courageous and risky as he could have lost his investment and future  the film is not true to the wonderful book and is unfortunately hollywoodized  frank sinatra and ive never been a fan playing frankie machine is astonishing in his performance one forgets it is frank up there the level of realism he brings to the role of a jonesing drug addict has to be seen to be believed  kim novak eternally gorgeous and talented does not disappoint in the role of the devoted outsider always there for frankie  supporting roles particularly a young handsome and talented darrin mc gavin are faultless  eleanor parker playing frankies wife is hopelessly inept she swings from irritating to melodramatic and is far too over the top a forgettable performance  the stagey cheap settings are appalling as if a firm gust of wind would blow the whole tacky painted cardboards over the horizon almost laughable at times in their tawdry cheapness  the music was irritating poundingly so at times as if each nuance of the script example when louie is getting frankie his fix out of a drawer had to be underscored at a high decibel level  7 out of 10 sinatra truly deserved his oscar nomination worth seeing,positive,1
spoilers a jewish frodo yep thatll be elijah wood again  ever since the concluding part of lord of the rings elijah wood as frodo has found it increasingly difficult to get away from that major role playing a football hooligan a psychopath and now a young jewish american wood has tried any route he can to escape this typecasting now with everything is illuminated he might finally have achieved this playing a role which isnt as radical as other efforts he truly gets to the soul of his character still it isnt like wood does this alone aided by a magnificent adaptation by first time directer liev schreiber and a wonderful performance by newcomer eugene hutz wood has found a magnificent production to spread his wings everything is illuminated is a magnificent moving piece of cinema  jonathan safran foer wood a young american jew sets out to the ukraine to find the mysterious girl who rescued his grandfather and helped him get to america arriving in the country jonathan meets the all talking all dancing alex hutz and his racist grandfather boris leskin travelling across the country the three slowly learn more and more about the history and relations that alex and jonathan never knew existed  its a strange feeling when the film progresses into its second chapter it is actually divided into four overall the first part whilst occasionally a bit funny is mostly serious and intense so when we are given a brief history of alex and his family in the second part to switch from serious to hilarious is a weird step it doesnt quite work but as the film progresses it definitely learns its lesson as this mix of humour and sadness merges finer as time passes  to the ultimate credit of everyone involved as the story does continue so do we begin to fall for the characters more and more elijah wood is magnificent boris leskin is so intense and strong that it raises questions why hollywood has never properly noticed him most notable of all however is newcomer eugene hutz playing an intensely troubled character hutz is absolutely brilliant he shows the split between his relatives and the real world with almost perfect skill and when his character is communicating with wood you genuinely connect with him on a deeper level without hutz the story is so strong that the film would still be magnificent but with him it hits the next level  as a debut work for actor turned director liev schreiber the story is also a brilliant piece to start a work of passion schreibers grandfather himself an immigrant to america he manages to truly embrace the emotion of the content and by presenting us with some truly beautiful scenery and some magnificent shots he manages to really hit home the final half hour in particular is so beautifully created that its a challenge for a tear not to form in any viewers eye it is a moving story and with schreibers help it becomes even more powerful  constructed with love from a passionate director everything is illuminated is a beautiful piece a road story with a difference it is magnificently acted and wonderfully written its a film that everyone should see and it is the perfect way for elijah wood to finally lay frodo to rest,positive,1
it seems that the people behind envy realised that recent comedies  especially ones involving ben stiller and to a lesser degree jack black  have been situation spoofs which have steadily declined in originality and generally laughs i found the sheer absurdity of zoolander utterly hilarious when it was released starsky and hutch was also enjoyable and then dodgeball kept the laughs going for a lot of people although personally i was a bit tired of the overthetop characters  especially when the scenario wasnt quite so funny perhaps the comedy of a dodgeball tournament doesnt quite translate to australia where its rarely played so in an attempt to do something a little more original envy moves away from an absurd scenario and instead revolves around the absurd creation of jack blacks character i wont spoil what it is for those who intend to see the movie the problem is that the movie seems to drag im not a big enough movie buff to be able to think of examples but it seems like this set up has been done a thousand times before  and very rarely successfully so instead of a nice crisp enjoyable and fresh comedy you get a film that seems to just go through the motions sure the motions can be quite amusing and theyre centred on an idea that is quirky enough to provide a few laughs  especially with jack black playing the excited and amusing though a bit 2d creator ben stiller on the other hand seems a bit lost hes asked to play a fuller role than the ridiculous characters of his zoolander breed of movies but he struggles as a family man whether his fault or the scripts there isnt enough depth to the character and the result is a movie of ben stiller doing those typical mannerisms and generally becoming tedious the performance doesnt leave an imprint on the viewer hes just ben stiller jack black manages to actually portray a character  though not a challenging one the last annoying element of the movie is christopher walkens role as the j man which is about as typical and two dimensional as characters come and naturally he becomes monotonous and frustrating very quickly  its really not as unbearable as some people would have you think its watchable especially if youre in the right mood feeling silly would be a good prerequisite for seeing this film hire it on a movie night with friends and watch it after youve watched a scary film and feel like something light  hopefully youll also be somewhat tipsy by then too in that scenario i can imagine it would be quite enjoyable but generally it provides too few laughs to carry itself and most of the time just drags along,negative,0
after erasing my thoughts nearly twentyseven times there is a feeling that i can now conquer this review for the complex french drama read my lips having written over five hundred reviews i have never found myself at such a loss of words as i did with director jacques audiards subtle yet inspirational love story thought was poured over what was loved and hated about this film and while the loves overpowered it was the elements that were hated that sparked further debate within my mind read my lips is a drama to be more precise is a character driven drama which fuses social uncertainty with crime lords with the doldrums of everyday office work here is where this review begins to crumble it is all of these items  but it is moremuch much more as a viewer you are pulled in instantly by emmanuelle devos portrayal of this fragile woman named carla whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty audiard introduces us harshly to her world by removing sound from the screen whenever she is not wearing her aid causing an immediate unrest not only from the characters within the film but to those watching without sound the world is left open to any possibility and that is frightening  as we watch this difficult and unsettling woman setting into her life we are then uprooted and given the opportunity to meet paul played exquisitely by vincent cassel a slickedback hair mustachewearing lanky man who was just released from prison homeless jobless and forced by his parole officer to get a job this is how carla and paul meet there is that moment of instant unsettling attraction the one where we think she loves him but he is dark and here is where it gets even more fun  and where we think he loves her but she is dark the constant role reversal creates the tone of the unknown who as viewers are we to feel the most sympathy for paul sleeps in the office carla helps him carla looses a contract to a rival coworker paul helps her carlas ability to read peoples lips comes in handy for a makeshift idea for paul the continual jumps back and forth keep you on your chair waiting for the possibility of some light to shine through this dark cave it never does audiard cannot just allow this story to take place he continually introduces us to more characters one just as seedy as the next even our rock our solid foundation with the parole officer is in question when his wife goes missing  a subplot to this film that at first angered me but upon further debate was a staple finale for this film yet none of this could have happened if it werent for our characters devos solemn and homely look is breathtaking as she changes her image for paul the truth of her beauty is discovered paul the wildcard in the film continues to seemingly use and abuse the friendship for his final endgame then just as we assume one carla takes on one last shape  audiard knows he has amazing actors capturing his characters cassel and devos could just play cards the entire time and i would still be sitting at the end of my chair the story probably the weakest part of this film is at first random the interwoven stories seem unconnected at first but audiard lets them connect bit by bit again the entire parole officer segment was tangent but that final scene just solidified the ends to the means not attempting to sound vague but this complex yet utterly simple story is difficult to explain there is plenty happening but it is up to you to connect the pieces a favorite scene is when carla is attempting to discover where some money is being held that use of sound and scene was brilliant it was tense it was dramatic and it was like watching a whodunit mystery unfold before your eyes  overall i initially though this was a mediocre french film that i could easily forget about when it was over  i was proved wrong read my lips opens the floor for discussion not just with the characters but the situations one will find themselves rooting for carla in one scene and paul in the next when a discovery is made in pauls apartment by carla i found myself deeply angry audiard brought true emotion to the screen with his characters and development and what he was lacking in plot  the actors were able to carry i can easily suggest this film to anyone but be prepared this isnt a one time viewing film repeat repeat repeat  grade  out of ,positive,1
even though the story is light the movie flows so beautifully and its visual so tranquil and poetic that it could almost carry the whole movie  the film consists of four interconnected stories all about different aspect of attraction between man andor woman and how it frequently is ethereal their true desire seems to be always something that they cannot hold onto it will flow out like a handful of sand  i thought the most intriguing story was the last one where the more unattainable the woman was the more the man desires her it parallels her deep love for god who is infinitely out of reach but never closer to her heart  a very good movie 710,positive,1
bill and teds bogus journey is the sequel to bill and teds excellent adventure their bogus journey follower almost directly after the first movie and does just as good of a job if not better to entertain the viewer  the plot is an evil person from the future is trying to kill bill and ted using evil robots that look exactly like bill and ted once the robots kill bill and ted they must compete with the grim reaper death and return their lives to normal  the acting in the movie is top notch and even thought it is a little weird at times especially bill and teds conversations it is a great movie the wannabe rockers sure have made another great movie pick this up the next time your at blockbuster,positive,1
 when dubbed into another language lets face it neither nielsen nor schwarzenegger are really good actors when it comes to dialog and given the campy lines they are supposed to utter this is a looseloose situation any type of voiceover is sure to be an improvement and it actually is  at least in the german version  but that is only a minor point the acting is bad the speeded up combat sequences are pathetic nielsen couldnt use her sword to fight her way out of a wet paper bag this becomes painfully obvious when compared to the fluidity of motion exhibited by the kid who has had some martial arts training no doubt and to the athleticism shown off by sandahl bergman  schwarzenegger does his conan thing  nothing new here  some of the visuals are nice ill have to grant that the dragon skeleton bridge looks cool but more often than not the plaster is all too evident  overall the movie isnt worth seeing even conan the destroyer is better than this although only marginally i would have much rather seen bergman as red sonja as she was originally supposed to be but i doubt that that could have saved this movie  oh well  310,negative,0
i remember trying a few minutes of this film im very surprised i didnt watch all of it from director steve gordon his only film directed before dying of heart failure basically arthur bach golden globe winning and oscar nominated dudley moore is the happy drunk millionaire with everything he could want a mansion a butler hobson oscar and golden globe winning and bafta nominated sir john gielgud and plenty of booze he is to inherit 750000000 if he marries the daughter of fellow millionaire burt johnson stephen elliott they woman he and the family have chosen susan jill eikenberry but instead arthur finds himself falling for queens waitress linda marolla golden globe nominated liza minnelli which of course is threatening the inheritance and 34 of his familys fortune from father stanford thomas barbour and aunt martha geraldine fitzgerald after the death of hobson arthur on the day of the wedding disobeys the familys wishes but aunt martha still gives arthur the inheritance to live happily ever after with true love linda also starring ted ross as bitterman barney martin as ralph marolla anne de salvo as gloria  hooker maurice copeland as uncle peter bach justine johnston as aunt pearl bach florence tarlow as mrs nesbitt marcella lowery as harriet  marthas maid john bentley as perry and peter evans as preston langley  party guest moore is wonderfully funny and a little cringing as the almost always drunk millionaire minnelli is likable as the woman he loves and gielgud of course makes a great oscar winning impression as moores humorous humble sarcastic servant a terrific screwball comedy it won the oscar for best song for arthurs theme best that you can do it also won the golden globe it was number 79 on 100 years 100 songs and it was nominated best writing screenplay written directly for the screen it was nominated the bafta anthony asquith award for film music for burt bacharach and it won the golden globe for best motion picture  comedymusical sir john gielgud was number 35 on the 50 greatest british actors and the film was number 53 on 100 years 100 laughs very good,positive,1
audrey i know you truly cherish your husband teds memory but please do his legacy justice and heed his wishes dr seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason we beg of you to please stop cashing in on his stories images fantasies and characters they are getting disemboweled by the powers that be of hollywood and broadway the children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books  it is indeed your property to do with as you wish i just wish you would listen to the advice of others for a little while save what is left of dr seuss thank you,negative,0
if you have been to the east of europe or even in their armed forces you might find this movie interesting i dont know why calls this a comedy sure there are a few funny moments but it is not a good movie if one of the orderly officers talks for 15 min about the achievements of socialism on a christmas dinner and the officers in general act like funny oafs the soldiers are running of the base to meet their girls at night and surprise surprise one of the girls is the daughter of the commander the east german army was known for its abusive and humiliating service of its conscripted men and the comedy was basically not filmed on the facilities or with the equipment to make a good movie of the east german army and their time now gone by despite this some of the actors and actresses tried to act well but it came out only in the roles theyre known for from east german tv and some small films i would not recommend this movie to anybody it was basically boring and very cheap made,negative,0
i borrowed this movie because not only because its gay theme but the thought of role playing really intrigued me i was pleasantly surprised that it was shot in san francisco since i live near sf and of course it was nice to see shots of the castro district although the castro to me really caters more to gay male than female but other than that i cant really recommend this movie the characters arent really developed for me to care and when they finally started to get to the role playing i was already bored out of my mind and the role playing scenes that i did see were a bit embarrassing to watch the acting leaves something to be desired needless to say i didnt finish the movie id skip this one,negative,0
i love this movie director michael powell once stated that this was his favorite movie and it is mine as well powell and pressburger created a seemingly simple superbly crafted story  the power of love against the powers that be however its deception lies in the complexity of its is it real or is it imaginary premise basically one could argue that it is simply a depiction of the effects of war on a young poetically inclined airman during wwii or is it the question is never answered one way or the other actually it is never even asked this continuous understatement is part of the films appeal  the innovative photography and cinematography even includes some nice touches portraying the interests of the filmmakers for instance pressburger always wanted to do a cinematic version of richard strauss opera der rosenkavalier about a young 18th century viennese aristocrat this is evident in the brief interlude in which conductor 71 dressed in all his finery holds the rose which appears silver in heaven the music even has a dreamy quality  all of the acting is first rate  david niven is at his most charming and he has excellent support from veteran roger livesey and relative newcomer kim hunter but in my opinion the films charm comes from marius goring as conductor 71 he by far has the most interesting role filling each of his scenes with his innocent lightheartedness brightening the film its a pity that some of conductor 71s scenes were left on the cutting room floor it is also a pity that gorings comedic talents are rarely seen again on film except in the wonderful videos of the scarlet pimpernel television series from the 1950s this is by far and away the most memorable role of his film career he is a perfect foil for relaxed style of niven and his virtual overstatement contrasts so nicely with the seriousness of the rest of the characters ironically also in the mid 1940s niven also starred against another heavenly messenger played by cary grant in the bishops wife their acting styles were so similar that i found the result boring unenergetic and disappointing as a note according to powell goring desperately wanted the role of peter carter initially refusing conductor 71 its a good thing he gave in and gave us such a delightful portrayal  the movie commissioned to smooth over the strained relations between britain and the us overdrives its point towards the end but it is disarming in its gentle reminders of the horrors of war  the numerous casualties both military and civilian the need to go on when faced with death there is a conspicuous lack of wwii enemies in heaven but the civilians shown are of indeterminate origin powell and pressburger could have been more explicit in their depiction but it wasnt necessary the movie may not have served its diplomatic purpose as was hoped for but its originality continues to inspire moviemakers and viewers alike on both sides of the atlantic,positive,1
i tried watching this abomination of the cinema when i was five years old i have never been the same since filled to the brim with druginduced images that reek of the common ravings of your average asylum resident this movie despite its colorful appearance is not for humans especially not children  it starts out innocently enough with a poor boy who ruins his classmates drum by wait for it putting his head through it yes putting his head through it but fear not my friends he is quickly consoled by his chirping flute which is weird enough ill grant you but still acceptable  then the movie morphs into a combination of wizard of oz and where the wild things are but loses all the warm and fuzzy aspects of either of these two books  so this sevenfoot yellow relative of barney befriends this poor boy and plunges him even deeper into despair  and to add the pleasant array of horrific themes a carnivorous boat formerly a friend of the motley crew of hobbling grandfather clocks and dopedup dragons is added to the mix of mayhem  the most comforting image in the midst of this chaos is the villain aptly dubbed witchiepoo  of course she has problems of her own what with an obvious plastic mask constricting her facial expressions to having to deal with a broomstick whose gas level always seemed to be at its lowest at the most inopportune moments as a result of this one of her favorite pastimes was nosediving into the body of water that separated the land of pufnstuf from her degenerate decaying abode i dont know where i would have preferred to live  in summary this movie is terrifying  if you want to watch the movie that has similar effects on its audience as the exorcist then this one is for you enjoy,negative,0
this film for what it was set out to be succeeded its a short tragic film although my choice of film are ones that really develop characters and their relationships this film is meant to just give a taste leaving you with the what happens next factor after watching it i really was wanting more more of the characters back story what influences they had to make them into the people they were i think thats what the makers intended the viewing audience to think the acting is amazing there arent many lines in the film so their body language facial expressions and overall presence needed to be powerful enough to withhold a scene both franco and miner have that element and it shows for them especially franco to take the time to make this obviously says they believed in this film and wanted to be apart of it and for that i appreciated the film for what it was also im happy i own it so i can share it with other people that wouldve never known it existed,positive,1
i have seen my fair share of comedy and standup movies but this one is so original so fresh it will make you wonder why you always walked right pass it in the video store murphy has some pretty raunchy jokes but this is just too funny to pass if only every movie could be this funny it should be called 107 minutes of the most incredible comedy murphy is a comic genius in this film and will make you say this is the guy that did dr doulittle he talkes about the ice cream man shoe throwing mothers his aunt with a mustache racism and everything else you could possibly think of and the ones you couldnt please if you ever see one comedy in your life this is it if only all movies could be delirious,positive,1
the worst and chock full of people who really ought to know better the cast have six oscars between them its set in contemporary africa it was made in 1979 and is about the slave trade its appallingly scripted and acted michael caine peter ustinov and william holden reach a career low in this one and completely lacks excitement never mind any moral focus its also ludicrously plotted you dont for a minute believe that any of the characters would behave in the way they do under these circumstances richard fleischer directs but you get the impression it was over the telephone this is as bad as it gets,negative,0
i saw this film at the toronto film festival where it received a standing ovation this film tells a story that to my knowledge has never been told beforenamely about the rosenstrasse a street in berlinuprising of german gentile women who were married to jews at the end of the second world war as such it is a unique story and whats more is the only film about the holocaust that i have ever seen that shows that there were good germans the helping family in anne frank for instance was dutch who did not support the nazis and in fact had the fortitude to stand up against their own countrys immorality and brutality during the nazi regime at the risk of their very lives the acting is great across the board the framing story in new york interesting and intricate the direction from von trotta masterful in every scene and the production values including the gorgeous cinematography outstanding of course the family in new york could be speaking german many immigrants in this country choose to speak in their native tongue with their familya common occurrence so that criticism is unwarranted to say more would spoil the experience the film is long but i did not look at my watch once i am hoping this film gets some distribution is north america for not only is this film a masterpiece but it can actually help heal any animosity people have towards the germans because of their support of hitler if this film is playing in your area i urge you to see it you will be glad you did,positive,1
this searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious african nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families by stowing away on an outbound ship they think that if they successfully make the voyage they can better their lives by making enough money in new york to send for their families unfortunately for them the ship that they select is a rundown russian freighter which has already been heavily fined at a previous port for harboring stowaways the captain and the first mate are determined not to let this happen again as their jobs are on the line the group of blacks begin their harrowing voyage in the cargo hold and are eventually discovered forced out of hiding and murdered by the ruthless mate an outstanding performance by sean pertwee a few convincingly terrified leader omar epps among them manage to temporarily escape and are mercilessly pursued through the ship with their lives forfeit if they are caught altogether a riveting film which will have audiences biting their nails and gritting their teeth wondering how such dire events could take place in modern civilization,positive,1
billed as the story of steve biko  played excellently by denzel washington as youd expect  this was actually more the story of donald woods played by kevin kline  this was undoubtedly the making of kline as a serious actor and he was surprisingly good in the role  attenborough gave this the sort of direction youd expect and the often spectacular scenes of the masses were those of the sort that only he can get across  the remainder of the cast was competent enough and did a good job in what ends up as an ultimately sad tale of a south africa that is still nowhere near the distant past,positive,1
i cant believe some of the comments here in the reviews the film is dated of course and from our comfortable viewpoint in the age of cgg a lot of the special effects are deeply unconvincing now but even allowing for this helen of troy is so bad that it is almost laughable   the scripting is awful just awful with no characterisation at all the performances suffer as a result you can see the likes of hardwicke and andrews writhing in an agony of embarrassment as they deliver the most ridiculous shallow trite codswallop lines the writers seem to feel the need to explain almost everything in a dreadful didactic screenplay that allows the viewer to decide nothing for himherself at all the beginning of the movie spells out the historical background as if no one had ever heard of ancient greece i know they had american audiences to take into consideration but the patronising way we are told everything twice to make sure we understood the action is really awful  i honestly cant believe the comments above describing this movie as a great epic film even allowing for the comparatively primitive cinematography and the relative sophistication of todays audience this movie truly stinks,negative,0
st elmos fire has no bearing on life after university at all for the majority of us common folk anyway why was this garbage even made who can really relate to this who lives like these characters i truly feel sorry for the actors having to deal with such a terrible script there are some talented young actors in this film that have done a good job elsewhere it must have just been one whole joke to them on set  i actually found this film insulting to my intelligence the only joy i got from this is hoping that sir john hughes had a good ol laugh when he saw a screening of this the same year his masterpiece of the breakfast club was released  dont make the same mistake i did of watching this because you enjoy 80s films it really is that offensive to the genre,negative,0

just desserts was i must say one of the worst movies i have ever seen the acting was terrible and even the plot line was laughable i gave it a 3 out of 10 instead of a 1 because i enjoy laughing at excruciatingly corny movies my expectations werent high to begin with but it turned out to be cornier than i expected i thought it might not be all that bad when it started but as soon as the name of the competitionthe golden whiskcame up i began changing my mind it all went downhill from there the only thing i did like about this movie other than snickering at its absurd plot and dialogue was watching them cook however being a movie about pastry chefs there were minimal scenes in which they actually baked anything i would recommend watching the cooking channel instead of this movie you get to see more food being prepared and you dodge the pathetic oneliners however if you enjoy corny love stories which is sometimes fun go ahead and watch,negative,0
this film is a benchmark in nonmainstream cinema history the use of montage represents a quantum leap from the relatively simple juxtapositions of strike eisensteins 1st film take the scene on the steps and note the repeated shot of the soldiers descending to reiterate the point of the horrors that actually did happen a highly intelligent monumental film a must see for all film students,positive,1
1st watched 5262002  4 out of 10dirmichael almereyda weird story about a druid witch who tries to capture eternity by inheriting her granddaughters body at least i think that was the relationship a kind of eerie quality is held throughout this film not unlike stephen kings the shining the difference is that there was campiness in nicholsons performance that isnt at all in this film this is all taken very seriously until near the end when some lame oneliners and attempts at litening up the mood dont work at all the performances are not the problem here but the story is everything doesnt seem to come together very smoothly and the viewer is left with a lot of pieces of information and no real understanding of what happened in the film there is a very small throwaway performance by christopher walken as the uncle of the granddaughter which of course gives him topbilling in an attempt to sell the film dont buy into this gimmick and avoid this film  ,negative,0
jack blacks character tim dingman the dreamer in envy finds wealth and success in the idea of a aerosol spray vapoorize that when sprayed on doggie dung makes the poo disappear into thin air   for a moment i was hoping that vapoorize was a real product so that i could spray it on this stinker of a movie and make it disappear into thin air as well  although envy is not the worst movie that i have seen in the past 12 months that honor goes to the cat in the hat it does get the honor of a close second  not funny not sad not anything a real stinkeroo  a 02 out of 10,negative,0
this film was incredible looked high budget but felt heartfelt and original like an indie the most amazing part of this film were the astonishing performances by david beazely mark hildreth and paul anthony who plays the main role he carried this film with ease humor and charisma balanced with a huge depth   the cinematography was really beautiful even though some of the subject was quite ugly it wasnt very realistic in that way but it didnt have to be to make a larger point it was really great seeing alan cumming in this too the script was tight and propelled very nicely with some of the best acting ive seen in a while  go see this,positive,1
the cure is a very touching and poignant drama the film focuses on two neighborhood boys who become good friends one of the boys has aids the boys become good friends despite eriks apprehensiveness at first the film shows the boys journey to discover the cure which is in ohio according to the national examiner and how it affects their relationship the acting is wonderful i have never seen annabella sciorra do better and the movie is just plain touching i couldnt stop crying with the shoe scene this is a good tearjerker keep the kleenex nearby 810,positive,1
a lot of horror fans seem to love scarecrows so i wont be very popular in saying that i found it to be rather boring the idea behind it was interesting but it seems to drag so much i think the main problem is that it is all set in darkness sometimes horror films set in darkness can work such as humongous but scarecrows is in darkness for the whole film a lot of the time its hard to figure out whats actually happening and although some shots of the scarecrows were creepy most were hard to even see if a little more lighting had been used perhaps it couldve been better  theres not many films involving killer scarecrows to my knowledge apart from dark night of the scarecrow which is much better i would recommend that over scarecrows any day,negative,0
eight simple rules started as a very entertaining series i love john ritter and his character paul hennessey and the relationship he had with his children was the best part of the show  i have always preferred kerry to bridget bridget has been done before kerry is quite unique and i can relate to her in many ways although im not sure i like the direction her character went in later series  early episodes were fun good simple teenage plots about paul and cate disciplining the kids however i think the show lost its sparkle when john ritter died i admired the cast and crew for wishing to continue the series but when he died i felt the programme did to to me the whole point of the show was based around the guide of the 8 simple rules of dating my teenage daughter it was written by a real man with teenage daughters and the relevance and the angle of the show had changed without the hennessey dad  bridget seemed to get more annoying rory stayed the same and cate was always giving her offspring lifes lessons which before seemed funnier when it was all left to paul i think the granddad is funny especially when hes watching great escape but feel cj is unnecessary to the show he is funny in parts but i felt the story lines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other american comedy series over all the newer ones arent bad just missing excitement and does anyone else find it irritating that cate works at the school and cj and granddads always there too i would always recommend this show to friends as it was very strong at the beginning and well worth watching for paul and kerry but later ones were about average at best,positive,1
seriously i don´t really get why people here are bashing it i mean  the idea of a killer snowman wreaking havoc on a tropical island paradise is pretty absurd the good news is the producers realized it and made it a comedy in the vein of army of darkness   especially in the second half of the film when the little killer snowballs attack i laughed my ass off for example the put one of the little creeps into a blender a la gremlins 1 and mix it after that it morphs back into a snowball and squeals with a high pitched voice that was fun  bottom line  incredible movie rent it,positive,1
vincent cassel plays the part of paul an excon assigned to an office job where he meets carla a secretary who is quite deaf when she has her hearing aids in very deaf when not played by emmanuelle devos together they help each other to develop as people  what was particularly interesting about this film was the complexity of the characters  not fitting into obvious stereotypes paul appears uneasy in the office environment is it that hes just not cut out for work this belief is dispelled when he gets a job in a bar and shines  the film has a certain amorality which i find refreshing and showed how easy is to act criminally even if we think it is harmless or justified  finally it is a film full of great moments both touching and humorous one is when carla is babysitting and is trying to comfort a screaming baby she continues to cuddle it  but takes her hearing aids out for her own comfort,positive,1
i have seen the movie holes and say that it has to be the best movie all year long it brings out the child in everyone i mean who would come up with the idea of having troublesome boys dig holes as their punishment louis sachar thats who although the movie was different from the book it was still very good for example cavemanstanley was supposed to be the biggest one there weight wise and height wise but zigzagricky was taller and armpittheodore was bigger also xrayrex was supposed to be one of the smallest boys but wasnt the only thing that i didnt like about the movie was that the flashbacks were rather persuasive and long i would have rather seen more of the present than past but thats just my opinion i especially like the work of the boys though like squidalan who was played by jake msmith was supposed to be a moody and tough kid jake msmith performed just that and did a great job at it as did almost all of the actors in holes so i would say if you havent seen holes yet then you should definatly see it when it comes out again or youll be missing out on a whole lotta fun,positive,1
this movie was the slowest and most boring so called horror that i have ever seen i would include a comment on the plot but there was none i do not recommend this movie unless you are prepared for the biggest waste of money and time of your life,negative,0
heres one more beauty in the string of beautiful films directed by eytan fox the movie presents the story of starcrossed lovers one israeli one palestinianin modern tel aviv the films effectiveness comes not only from its depiction of crossethnic conflict but of conflicts personal and political within ethnic groups as well for example theres a telling moment when one of the secondary characters openly gay is visited in the hospital by his boyfriend who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family and suddenly we see a wave of awkward discomfort wash through the room clearly the young man is not as open as he seems and the family not as accepting as he might want them to be while the boyfriend is confused and rejected a good deal of complexity is packed into a fleeting moment as we know from yossi  jagger fox is a master at efficiently packing emotional and psychological complexity into brief sequences the film is also effective for the evenhanded way it presents the mutual brutalities that israelies and palestinians inflict on each other if youre not heartless youll cry through the last third of the movie though the plot is melodramatic its so intelligently written and acted that it reminds us of how satisfying good melodrama can be,positive,1
this is one of them movies that has a awesome video box but has wired camra work and unknown actors that speak with bad dialogueits so dark when the killings happen you can hardly see it plus the movie is hard to understandthe only star in this is wcws vanessa sanchez tygres in wcw before it folded and she is a good actress i like low budget film especialy ones that has errors because they are fun to watch but severed unfourtunatly isnt one of themthis movie is ok to see if you like voodoo and severed heads but this is no blockbuster but if you need something new to watch then rent severed,negative,0
the hero john keem is going after some drug dealers who kidnaps girls for some reason on his journey he uses karate and kung fu moves and i dont believe he got hit a single time during the movie this is crap,negative,0
this is a really nice and sweet movie that the entire family can enjoy its about two dogs and a cat who are taken away to live with someone else for a little while but the animals dont understand and they escape and go to find the family on their own the cat is named sassy and she lives up to her name chance is the younger dog who knows a lot about life on the inside of the pound shadow is the older and wiser dog who senses things put those three together on an adventure and it makes for a happy and fun filled time there are no special effects of the mouths moving so it isnt cheesy at all its the best talking animal movie that ive seen so far its a really good movie for families,positive,1
a noble effort i guess but ultimately a poor one before seeing this film i felt bartleby the scrivener was unfilmable after seeing it i still do unfortunately i think only those who have read the story will understand what is going on and they will be upset at the films needless revisions updating from 1850 to 1970 moving from new york to london even the superb talents of paul scofield cant salvage what looks to me like a well meaning but misguided effort to film melvilles metaphysical classic,negative,0
im astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of black snake moan its not about blackwhite relationships or oldyoung relationships though i think director craig brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos its not about sexual abuse or sex addiction though christina riccis character rae typifies those its not about folk religion in the black community though religion plays a large role its not a love story though there are not one but two happy couples at the end and its certainly not about the south where everything is hotter though its set in the south and its undeniably hot holy smokes even the tagline writers didnt get the point  black snake moan is a parable about mississippi delta blues who feels them who writes them who plays them what theyre playing about how it heals them  its as though the film producers sat down with a blank slate and asked ok if we were going to help people understand what the blues are really about what would it look like so they set it in the rural south then they dream up two characters one whose wife left him to live with his best friend the other who goes off to war and his badly abused girl sleeps with everybody in town then we throw in grizzled worldliness touched just a little by folk religion they know jesus wants their lives and though they respect him they know they cant give him that some violence between men and women and lots and lots of steamy sexual images including  ready to go over the top  a black man in a sleeveless undershirt holding a halfnaked white girl captive on the end of a 40 lb chain fill it with authentic delta blues sounds make it about a genuine blues picker use music as the main healing element in the plot slap clips of bluesman son house on both ends and voila  you have a modern parable about what the blues are all about even the films climax is not character conflict but the whole town dancing steamy dances to hot raunchy blues  of course theres a bit of a dilemma here rae ricci is being destroyed by uncontrollable lust and is being healed by lazarus jacksons homey religion and steadfastness and dont forget the chain but then were shown the restored rae dancing raunchily to blues at the end is this an expression of a restored healthy life force or just more of the same trashy behavior that ruined her in the first place brewer wants it both ways but blues really is about sex and violence not to mention depression i suppose he would say blues gives healthy expression to both sex and violence without unleashing either i have my doubts  not for the first time samuel l jackson plays so well that we forget were watching samuel l jackson the man is unbelievably good he even picks some of his own tunes in the film and his playing is authentic dirty and hot christina ricci isnt usually this good either granted half her job is done by the costume that wasnt there and her slinky figure but shes a marvelous combination of cynical lust rebellion and vulnerability bravo to her shes arrived i was impressed by the country preacher john cothran jr i had to check the database to assure myself that hes a professional actor and not a genuine country minister  parents need to be aware of what theyre getting if their kids bring this one home the language is pretty far off the charts the first halfhour is full of graphic sex and women are violated in a dozen ways during the course of the film lazarus means well and is decent but honestly chaining a woman to the radiator plus ricci spends half the movie dressed for sex if youve got teenage boys theyll be licking the screen halfway into the film i dont recommend this for kids of any age adults only please  that being said black snake moan is informative and accurate about blues folk religion and sexual abuse and tells a tale thats redemptive in lots of ways its unorthodox but well worth the time and my goodness is the sound track hot,positive,1
i wont describe the story as that has been done elsewhere we are great clive owen fans and when our netflix recommended the movie we were intrigued   no wonder we had never heard of this movie because it was a bbc television movie back in 1992 hence the poor production values grainy image  jerky camera work and poor sound  but you dont really mind the mechanics because the story itself will put you to sleep its an interesting human story but not at all compelling and there is hardly any ending you dont really care for the characters as their lives are as boring as your life watching this tedious movie save the two hours and do something to make the time more worthwhile,negative,0

hey i really do not know why this film has been appreciated so muchperhaps i missed the pointthe way i see it  a lot of international film makers have made brilliant films that have dealt with schizophrenia and have informed excited shockedevoked emotion and compelled the audience to step aside from their own reality and thinkwhile it is true that aparna sens endeavor was an ambitious one in light of all the other movies  this one falls short miserablyit was too slow there were no details about anything and the ending  was completely pointlessit was not open ended or anything just pointlessso watch it if you want to see a good concept completely wasted,negative,0
my parents used to rent a lot of horror movies when i was a child we loved watching them even when they were bad they made for some enjoyment this was one such movie kind of hard to review as i have only seen it the one time as a child but it is not anything i want to track down again so i can do a more indepth review the story has some old horror actor legend dying i seem to remember he acted a bit like an over the top vincent price without being likable and classy he commits murders and dies but what is this is the movie over already no as some kids for some reason snag the body and are prepared for a fun night of being killed by the ham from beyond the grave i remember the murders were nothing all that special after the first couple and i remember this movie was rather disappointing seemed to have a good premise but it just failed to deliver the goods as more cool kills were needed and that super horror actor needed to add a bit to his repertoire,negative,0
oh my god the worst sht ive ever seen this is the main thought which came into my mind right after watching the movie and i really do not understand anybody with opposite myth though maybe the idea was good but the effect miserable i especially mean the role of h graham what was that in my opinion it has destroyed all positive intentions of producers the character was played in affected and annoying way every time she appears it reminds that you re watching a movie and is destroying a spirit of the moment then whole movie because the most time what you can see there are her stupid faces with more stupid attempts to create the emotion terrible dont waste your time,negative,0
as many of the other comments i have read have noted i fell in love with this movie when i was a kid my sister and i had a copy of the movie on beta before vhs that we wore out of course it didnt help when our parents sold the betamax at a garage sale since then we have been trying to find a copy i like another commentator did eventually locate a rental copy at a local video store the owner would not part with the copy after any number of attempts to beg bribe and cry my way to owning the tape good news i bought a brand new newly released vhs copy of midnight madness for 999 on amazoncom two days ago finally disney has wizened up now if theyll only rerelease song of the south if you love the movie grab it if you havent seen the movie its worth a check  totally stupid humor but a lot of fun stephen furst is hilarious,positive,1
kudos to baxleys dp for making this look like a real movie the first time thats happened in this series with the notable exception of the fx scenes in moving closer to movie production values however it lost most of the entertainment value of the first two they were very much in the so bad theyre good category of horrendous film entertainment can an argument be made though that the believers were simply trying to make a generic action film with praying in it there are so many times in the film where they discard their own belief system as to be annoying if everything that happens is according to gods will and they are simply his instruments than the people who are infected with the virus have that happen as a part of his plan right apply that to every situation where someone of faith doesnt submit to gods will and you get a fairly hypocritical little movie from the director of action jackson,negative,0
i first saw it at 5am january 1 2009 and after a day i watched it again and i want to watch it again love everything well almost so 9 stars about it no color beautiful naive stories funny gangsters anna camera work music well sometimes you just want to listen little bit longer and the music just stops but this is not a musical after all i like annas acting this naive wannabe gangster girl how she speaks holds the gun everything makes me smile no its not that funny though i have laughed a bit at some moments its just so subtle excellent work by samuel benchetrit though 3d nouvelle seems weaker but they are also gangsters maybe even worse cause they are stealing ideas and the last scene is my favorite makes me feel so warm and romantic yes i would recommend this movie for the romantic souls with a taste for such arthousish movies and i dont agree with those comparing it to pulp fiction its not about action and twisted story though all vignettes intersect its calm and maybe too slow movie for most of the people its about characters their feelings very subtle anyway probably this review wont be of much help to anyone my first just wanted to express my appreciation  spoiler this movie doesnt have a goofs section wonder didnt anybody notice that hand in the 2 part when the kidnappers decided to go home looks like a part of crew hehe i know i should better post this in forums but i dont agree with some policies here,positive,1
id like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest crappiest movie ive ever seen  i have no idea whats wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings the only thing i can imagine is that people mustve voted during one or more conditions  1 while being shitfaced  stoned out of their minds 2 theyve received hard cash for the votes 3 under gunpoint  i cant believe i wasted a good 1 h 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie,negative,0
patricia hunter oh professor do you also make a habit of collecting coffins dr lorenz why yes in a manner of speaking i find a coffin much more comfortable than a bed   interesting bela lugosi glen or glenda dracula vehicle where he plays the mad scientist i was especially creeped out when he appeared in the bedrooms of his guests when they were sleeping  luana walters girls in prison was really appealing as a sensual reporter patricia hunter who was to be a victim but womanpower trumps evil scientist every time  211 angelo rossitto and creepy frank moran  who liked to stoke the womens hair added to the film  interesting look at a 40s horror film,negative,0
i thought i could see something good but i am tired after seeing this movie i dont know what i hated the most the script the acting the fx or the music try to picture the worst power rangers episode and would still be to kind ive seen better fx in fps games the touch with the bone sword or his breath that is making the people disappear in a green smoke is touch of genius and the music seems to come from a spaghetti western i did liked how the women in the car was screaming when the monster was walking around the car even if shes looking in the wrong way so give your self a break and dont watch this thing at least call somebody up to see a horror movie with you trust me you will end up playing monopoly for some kicks,negative,0
dirty war   aspect ratio 1781  sound format stereo  emergency services struggle to cope when islamic terrorists detonate a socalled dirty bomb in the middle of london  daniel percivals frightening movie uses all available evidence to dramatize the possible effects of a radioactive explosion in the heart of the uk capital using the kind of documentarystyle realism which has distinguished this particular subgenre since the 1960s in essence the film reveals a catalogue of flaws in the british governments current strategy for dealing with such terrorist outrages and percivals carefullyhoned script cowritten by lizzie mickery vents its spleen against mealymouthed politicians who would rather maintain the economic status quo than tackle this issue headon the film covers all necessary bases and makes the salient point that this kind of terrorism is practised by a tiny handful of fanatics who have tarnished the islamic faith with their reckless disregard for human life though viewers wont be reassured by the subsequent scenes of devastation and horror not merely a drama the film acts as a warning against complacency either that or its just another post911 scaremongering tactic you be the judge,negative,0
man has been to the farthest reaches of the earth and now he is traveling to new worlds but with new worlds come ancient evils the vampires of space and not just a handful but entire tribes in this film which i saw as bloodsuckers but i guess also goes as vampires wars we see what happens when the imperialist earthlings meet the imperialist vampires  i will make this review very short because its undeserving of a good review the best i can say for this film is it has a good cast of blist and upcoming stars natassia malthe was quintana and was far more attractive here than in bloodrayne 2 michael ironside is muco and is always a fan favorite as i say hes the poor mans jack nicholson and we even get carrieann fleming as damians wife who horror fans will now recognize as the eponymous jenifer from dario argentos jenifer so this movie as bad as it is isnt without some names attached but the same can be said of uwe bolls work  the concept of the military tracking and killing vampires in space isnt necessarily a bad idea but it easily falls into the realm of cheese and this film falls hard the acting especially from the vampires is over the top and i just didnt find the explanations of their existence very convincing worst of all the vampire tribes have the names voorhess and leatherfaces i understand this was supposed to be a clever reference for the horror fans but it wasnt clever at all it just sounded dumb and out of place unlike the much more subtle references in james gunns slither such as naming stores after lesserknown horror directors  thats all i want to say if you can stand lots of cheese on this day i couldnt and im from wisconsin and want to see average actors with poor costumes fight vampires in space although space looks a lot like any other forest on earth check this one out if you can find it i dont personally recommend this when you can watch other cheesy vampires films jon carpenters vampires or other cheesy space movies or maybe even some good ones but hey do your thing,negative,0
the london underground has something inherently creepy about it with its long winding tunnels the escalators taking you deeper and deeper underground and of course the rats roaming the tracksit a source of wonder that it is not used in horror films more often it was used in the seventies horror deathline aka raw meat featuring a cannibalistic tribe living in a disused tunnel and the celebrated chase sequence in american werewolf in london so i was pleased to see that someone else had tried to capitalise on the atmosphere of the tube at night with the recent uk production creep  i thought the film started off well with a highly effective credit sequence that was genuinely unnerving followed by a scene in the sewers that sets up the premise of there being something evil lurking below the streets of london however creep went downhill from here and i found myself wishing that id switched it off after this opening scene leaving me with a favourable impression of the film all the characters become unsympathetic and unlikable even potente herself and the director felt the need to hit us over the head with social commentary about homelessness he also made the mistake of showing the monster in full lighting where he ceases to become remotely scary and reveals his name to be craig how can you have a monster called craig it turns into an x filestype thing and reminds one of the episode tombs in fact i was wishing mulder and scully would turn up and sort them all out for me  as for the infamous sexualised violence it is very graphic disturbing and totally unnecessary it seems to be there merely to shock the audience rather than for any intrinsic plot value the trouble is it is so over the top and horrific that it actually numbs you to the rest of the horror which is a mistake as its only halfway through the film  so there you go the only redeeming feature of the film for me was a rare appearance from ken campbell one of my favourite occasional actors you dont see him very often but when hes on screen he acts everyone else into a corner casting him as a sewer inspector was a stroke of genius unfortunately the only one evident in the film,negative,0
its hard to comment on this movie its one of the few movies dimension actually has not shelved its hard to come up with a reason why and it was rushed into a an unimpressive 500 theaters its opening day maybe dimension was afraid of how people would respond to a swamp creature using his tow truck to pull a house apart piece by piece  ray sawyer is just a tow truck driver until he rescues a voodoo priestess from a bad car accident and in return he gets attacked by a bag full of snakes and drowns at the morgue ray comes back to life and stalks a group of teenagers who witnessed the awful crash occur   what brings this movie down is its paper thin characters i didnt care for one moment about any of them also the dialog was less than hohum also it was very predictable characters did the typical stupid horror movie character things like check creaky noises call out peoples names and trip on a rock while being chased i also could immediately pick out who the final girl would be and why did the camera have those quick white flashes whenever somebody died or whenever the killer was shown  whats good well there is an impressive suspense scene where the killer walks underneath swamp waters to get to his victims and a tense sequence where the final girl must camouflage herself with bunch of other dead bodies while the killer looks on  but other than that its another augustseptember disappointment i was looking forward to it but i did not get what was expected,negative,0
i actually though that black snake moan was great movie which takes place in the south the story follows a man named lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road lazarus finds out that rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up rae with a chain to cure her of her wickedness samuel l jackson and christina ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that lazarus and rae become best friends i was also amazed by sams ability to play an electric guitar and being able to sing s epatha merrkensen is great as lazarus love interest angela justin timberlake plays raes boyfriend ronnie who is underused in the film but does the best that he can to deliver a fine performance,positive,1
some weeks ago at a movie theater i saw a movie poster of el padrino 2004 with the tag the latin godfather how lame have we become i thought latin just because he is a mexican let me remind you that anything latin comes from or is related to latium italy so the original guy in the godfather movie is more latin than the mexican godfather and this is why we are called latinamerican people because we speak spanish a language based in the latin language that originated in rome now italy so to place a tag in a movie poster like the latin godfather is not just ignorant of course if we are trying to related this movie to the original godfather but a desperate and uncreative attempt to get some credit by copying the title of a movie classic now about the movie i just hate overacting so from 1 to 10 i guess is 3 the most,negative,0
very sweet pilot the show reeks of tim burtons better filmsedward sissorhands big fish charlie  the chocolate factory the cinematography the narration the music the external sets all scream tim burton there has to be a connection or a strong influence i just havent researched enough to know where it is  as ive seen in the forums yes anna friel is playing a poor mans zooey deschanel every time i see her on the screen i see zooey dont get me wrong anna friel does a great job her character is very sweet and lovable and you easily get attached to her its more of a distraction that i keep thinking why didnt they get zooey deschanel  lee pace does a great job too i kept trying to remember where i knew him from and just looked it up wonderfalls great short lived series from 2004 if you enjoy pushing daisies you must go rent wonderfalls which is another brian fuller creationhmmmm   loved seeing swoosie kurtz world according to garp and ellen greene little shop of horrors again two underrated character actresses that never fail to bring it with their performances,positive,1
japan is in serious trouble demons have infested edo taking possession of earthly forms and bending them to their unholy will on top of that the rebirth of ashura queen of the demons is nigh the only thing that stands against this grave threat are the demon wardens a fearsome group of warriors who might just be as bad as the demons themselves  izumo is a retired demon warden who five years ago took up theater instead of demon slaying after accidentally killing a innocent child in a battle thats strangely reminiscent of the bar scene from dusk till dawn one night by a chance encounter he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named tsubaki their fortunes intertwine literally and they are bound by fate to be lovers and enemies  if you think this sounds like your typical japanese fantasyswordplay epic youd be wrong in fact theres nothing typical about ashura it is a hodgepodge of many different genres of film those just mentioned as well as a comedy drama and romance director yojiro takita onmyoji juggles the genres fairly respectfully although the comedy seems forced in some scenes and the end result is a ridiculous but really fun popcorn movie  to be sure there are flaws in the film some of the humor seems contrived and out of place and the acting isnt the greatest but seriously do you watch fantasyswordplaycomedy films for the great acting performances no we watch them for the action and the crazy cg visuals all of which ashura has in spades not to be misleading the film is not all action but it is spaced out generously enough with lots of swordplay and buckets of green blood to keep the average viewer happy  bottom line the films has its faults and is not a martial arts epic but it doesnt try to be and it features interesting visuals and good swordplay action the reason the film worked for me is that it never takes itself too seriously and if the viewer does the same their sure to be delighted by this fun and silly swordplay fantasy action flick  my rating 7 out of 10 fun popcorn movie,positive,1
having endured this film last night i turned off the dvd player with a sense of deserving a medal for having the stamina to see it through to the end throughout the film i felt that i was watching the storyline fillers that you get in a high budget porn movie the acting was stiff and taut camera work appalling and the locations and sets were so poor it felt like they had borrowed them from the local high school amateur dramatics society  the only saving grace for this movie was that it had amy adams and harriet sansom harris in its credits other than that it was pure dribble,negative,0
hi there i watched the first part when it came out and i dont remember having left such a bad impression on me as this one  first the animation is choppy wooden not worked on lacks naturality  i understand the drawing style was to be of some atlantean kind but it could be done with the usual disney finesse see tarzan to see what i mean if i didnt see the disney logo in the beginning i would never say it was a disney movie  second the plot was more like a pc game style like a good old quest not that it was bad but it lacked a story that binds the viewer to the characters and their goals it was inconvincing at least the film was meant for children but this was waaay to childish at times  third the music i would say it was improper but it just fits the whole scene with the plot and animation  overall i think this was some kind of an amusement just bytheway kind of project by several apprentice animators just to fill in the count for disney movies sorry to hear that from myself a big disney lover,negative,0
mad dog timetrigger happy whatever you wanna call itsimply doesnt hit the mark maybe its just me maybe i just dont like gangster comedies  as i thought oscar  johney dangerously and mafia also sucked  its probably more witty sharp wordplay than all out comedy only its not as witty and sharp as it  or the other reviewers make it out to be   the rick  mick  vic thing was old to begin with making it a running gag was at times painful to watch   there wasnt enough changes of location or feel for the period they were supposed to be in the majority of the film was either set in dreyfuss club or a variety of offices dim rooms  what was with that sit down gun stand off thing goldblum kept winning    the supporting cast was on paper excellent  great to see silva  dragobut characters were killed off before they had time to develop and richard pryors cameo was a joke  the romance and love element of the film also bogged it down  410 i dont think ill return to it anytime soon,negative,0
i am at a distinct disadvantage here i have not seen the first two movies in this series although i have seen a lot of larry cohen films fans of the series seem to think this is a good film judging it on its own it was pretty boring  you never get a real good look at the maniac cops robert zdar face but what i did see was pretty grim the death scenes seem to be staged to eat up the most film not to give any thrills maybe if i saw the nc17 directors cut i may be more impressed  the ending with the car chase with zdar caitlin dulany and robert davi was pretty intense best part of the movie,negative,0
when i was 13 or so i was lucky enough to find this film it was part of an endless danish series of really cheesy stuff this however was the cheesiest i ever owned  but i guess i sold it too bad well what to write better than manos the hands of fate and worse than critters 4 but its definitely worth an hour and a half since this was made by people who wanted to make it the acting isnt that terrible compared to several other eighties trash  in fact i kind of like the old man even though he didnwt look that indian to me but i guess you cant have everything do yourselves a favour and look this up,negative,0
sheltered young woman homeschooled and possibly quite gifted harbors a disturbed overlyemotional side which comes to the surface after her absentee father pays her mother a visit asking for a divorce directed by celebrated cinematographer william a fraker this illtitled psychological thriller falls into the trap that most films helmed by directors of photography find themselves in each shot is composed for the utmost style but at the sacrifice of fluid pacing and a tight gripping narrative fraker and his cinematographer lászló kovács are very fond of gauzy whites and golden tones giving the picture a burnished tableaux feel the mansion at the center of the action looks like a funeral parlor and fraker paces the wheezing yarn just like a funeral robert shaw and sally kellerman as shaws fiancée two of the most interesting actors of the 1970s manage to cut through the plastic overlay and are quite compelling despite the jagged editing which turns their scenes into little bits of halfrealized business sondra locke another interesting screen personality seems cast for her resemblance to catherine deneuve in repulsion pale and saucereyed with imposingly thick and long hair locke is a curious human puzzle and shes initially quite intimidating and dangerous however this role is so oldhat that locke can find nothing fresh to bring out of the deep freeze and she flounders fraker allows lockes freakout scenes to go on and on while shaw looking terrifically debonair is put in the impossible position of playing touchyfeely daddy to her all of this nonsense might be worth slogging through if the screenplay had been peppered with a modicum of tangibility or at the very least some dry wit or humorous relief as it is lewis john carlino and edward humes limp script adapted from stanton forbes novel go to thy deathbed strands the viewer early on and only the charisma of the players gets us to the finish line 12 from ,negative,0
when i saw the elaborate dvd box for this and the dreadful red queen figurine i felt certain i was in for a big disappointment but surprise surprise i loved it convoluted nonsense of course and unforgivable that such a complicated denouement should be rushed to the point of barely being able to read the subtitles let alone take in the ridiculous explanation these quibbles apart however the film is a dream fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful bruno nicolai score he may not be morricone but in these lighter pieces he might as well be so really enjoyable with lots of colour plenty of sexiness some gory kills and minimal police interference super,positive,1
this film was positively the worst film i have ever watched i couldnt sit through the whole thing i also think writer must have some weird fetish for women peeing puking and crapping i mean what was that all about i cant believe this was even made and am disgusted at have ingwasted a £4 rental fee the quality both picture and sound are terrible the acting well doesnt exist  it was a poor excuse for a film and the scenes of pee crap and puke were reminiscent of 2 girls 1 cup urghh avoid at all cost the girls looked like they had been picked off the street and only got the part cos theyd be willing to take their tops off while these girls have nice bodies it certainly didnt make up for the fact their shrieking was awful unconvincing and a pain to my ears  this was like possibly worse than an ammateur school production without any proper direction and hey there is no need for a set as it all seems to revolve around a car   definatey not one to buy folks sorry if my first comment is terribly negative but i could not find anything positive to say and i would like to think i may save someone else wasting their money like i have,negative,0
i like silent films but this was a little too moronic as much as i wish i could say that it was worth the hour i stood up i cant i dont think any version of the movie even comes close to the book and dont try it out on kids they might freak and the lady who played pollyanna how old was she 38 i know the labor laws were different back then but come on people,negative,0
and the title says it all a cheesy sounding title that is a cheesy sounding joke of a film known as alien from la why not just call it alien from south africa as this is the place where this movie was filmed my advice for watching movies that have been featured on mystery science theater 3000 do not watch the original version of the movie at all period always watch the movie with the theater shadow at the bottom of the screen with a man trapped in space with his two funny wisecracking robot friends sitting at the lower right hand corner of the screen it just seems better that way  movie as it was originally seen awful movie as it was seen on mst3k genius,negative,0
comedy central has had success with original programming using professional comics the chapelle show mind of mencia the daily show and the hugely popular colbert report all star professional comics and all are or in the case of chapelle show were solid shows given that sarah silverman is one of the best female comics in the business i was expecting good stuff when i tuned in  i was so disappointed  there were some mildly funny sequences but given that the star is the caliber of silverman the show could have been much better it was just the pilot and hopefully next weeks show will be better if not get her some help in the form of better writers for the show,negative,0
did they use their entire budget paying the porno stars or what  sound effects background music and the editing in general was so bad youd think some 12yearold wannabe made the film  most of the acting was good considering the script the innocent virgin played her part really well  the mutants look really cool and this actually could have been a really cool flick with the right brain behind the wheel but unfortunately for all involved thats not the case  turn left was made better than this movie and those guys didnt even have any money good thing i didnt rent the movie myself,negative,0
the first time i watched cold case was after it had run for about a year on danish television at the time it came to the tv it nearly drowned in 4 or 5 other american crime shows aired roughly the same time  i saw it and i was bored to death the substandard actors with the self righteous faces and morals were a pain in the behind the entire premise that so much money was given a team of investigators to solve murders dating back 102030 or even 60 years seems so unlikely  the time is also a factor as they only have 5060 min to tell the story which means that they get a break through just in the nick of time to solve the case and bring justice to surviving family members if they are still alive this combined with the personal problems and relations of the investigators which there has to be time for leaves the show a complete lackluster  i give it a 2star rating because of the music i the end which is really the only reason for watching itwhich you then of course wont do as that is too lame a reason for watching this crap,negative,0
well not actually this movie is very entertaining though went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the i think there might be something in my eye routine the movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance jim carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides in fact all the characters are great the movie is not overly funny or sappy good flick to go see with the wife  all in all 810note  i am not an easy grader thats all from bigv over and out,positive,1
a guy thing tries to capture the feeling of theres something about mary or meet the parents but comes off more like it was edited up out of cuttingroom rejects of those two films thankfully i rented it on a 5day rental because i couldnt sit and watch more than 20 minutes at a time  the premise is decent and i liked the scenes where other guys automatically cover up for pauls missteps the checker at the savemart was great but the scriptwriting is absolutely horrible the dialog falls flat most of the time and just when you think that things are finally going to get on track some needless sightgag is stuck in for no good reason plus how many toilet jokes does one movie really need  dont get me wrong slapstick humor is great when its smartly done as in the other films i mentioned but this movie simply misses the mark too bad as i love julia stiles ten things i hate about you was great but even that couldnt help me sit through this terrible movie save your dollars and go rent theres something about mary one more time,negative,0
this movie was exactly what i expected it to be when i first read the casting i probably could have written a more exciting plot its a pity that they left it to a pack of howler monkeys alberto tomba was surely a good skier but he has to thank god and we too that he does not have to rely on his actor skills to earn his living he cant play he cant talk he cant even move very good on mainland without his skis michelle hunziker is a pretty blonde girl and thats all she obviously wasnt chosen for her astounding competence in dramatic roles but most probably for her nice legs nevertheless i must admit that she could be the tombas acting teacher because hes even a worse actor than her and thats funny especially considering that she isnt italian i laughed all the time watching this movie i found it so ridiculous and meaningless that it actually made me laugh loud very loud,negative,0
too bad neither the animals or eddie murphy had anything to say worth saying this movie is just bland  childrens movie well if youre trying to get them to take a nap then maybe its just 90 minutes of some eyewrenchingly poor animal lip animation to quips that arent funny and the lipsyncing makes the old godzilla films look brilliantly done by comparison meanwhile eddie pluto nash murphy drones on with a suppressed understated delivery that is painful to experience apparently hes trying to modify his old manic persona but to what in short all the magic and wonder of the 1967 original version is lost in this reimagining or whatever it is a town wants to bully some forest creatures and blame them for doing bad stuff no really and pluto nash can psychobabble with them things chain along with some stale jokes to a dull uninspired conclusion with no surprises  rent the 67 movie or some old yogi bear cartoons,negative,0
okay so gus van sant wanted to remake psycho in color so that he could bring it into modern audiences who would probably go into cardiac arrest if they were ever forced to see a movie in black  white while they conveniently forget that both clerks and schindlers list were filmed in black  white and are great movies  unfortunately the same narrowminded people who wouldnt want to see a great movie just because its in black  white are the same people who wouldnt like psycho anyway because it doesnt have a murder or sex scene every two minutes and the murders are not the grisly bloodgutsgorebonesnapping that people are used to from having seen halloween friday the 13th and nightmare on elm street this is why remaking psycho almost exactly as it was originally was destined to not work because its really only of interest to people who are fans of the original everyone else is just watching it to tide them over until the next scream sequel comes out and for that reason they will be disappointed psycho relies on suspense and mystery not blood and guts and just so nobody thinks that i must be a senior citizen if i like older movies let me set the record straight by saying that i am 21  so if doing the movie in color was all that van sant wanted to change why not just colorize the movie and rerelease it i mean whats the point of remaking a movie if youre not going to change anything the least he could have done was to put his own directors spin on it rather than just copying hitchcocks  or even better hired a new writer to adapt a new script from the original psycho book but it seems that van sant couldnt decide whether he wanted to remake psycho exactly or not this should have been an all or nothing project  either remake the movie exactly or do it differently  but as it stands this movie is about 95 the same but with a few touches thrown in that dont seem to have any purpose such as having norman masturbate while he spies on marion undressing it doesnt serve the plot at all and the only reason he put it in was because he could he wanted to say hitch couldnt show people masturbating in 1960 so im going to do it whoopee big deal like im so shocked at seeing someone masturbate and what on earth was the point of showing single frame shots of clouds and farm animals spliced into the murder scenes and then he leaves out an important scene where lila and sam meet the sheriff outside the church  plus by using the almost exact same script the entire movie seems a bit of an anachronism the opening credits say that the year is 1998 then whats with marions 60ish looking dress or the parasol she carries with her why do marion and sam have to have their trysts in a hotel room when these days nobody would be shocked by what they are doing why are there no air conditioners in marions office why does the bates motel have no tvs in the rooms and apparently no automatic locks on the doors why does the sheriff have to ask the operator to connect him to the bates motel this was why using the exact same script was a mistake  just changing a few words here and there was not enough to modernize it it needed a whole reworking  while vince vaughn turned in a good performance as norman he just didnt seem right for the part part of what made the original psycho so creepy was that norman had that innocent boynextdoor quality so nobody could believe that he was capable of such horrible crimes with vince vaughn playing the part is anyone really surprised that norman was a psychopathic killer  that said i can understand that gus van sant was obviously a fan of the original psycho movie and wanted this to be a tribute this isnt a bad movie but the problem is that this may be some peoples only exposure to psycho i really think you should see this movie only if youve seen the original since i am a fan of anything to do with psycho i bought a used copy of the remake which i may watch occasionally the original movie was a filet mignon whereas the remake is a hamburger but even filet mignon would get boring if you had it everyday so its nice to have a hamburger once in a while for a change,negative,0
a gutripping baby trex is on the loose in a small western town prompting sheriff eric roberts and animal control agent melissa brasselle who walks through her role in a very disinterest fashion to get to the bottom of things they discover that a mad scientist corbin bernsen is unbeknownst to the government sponsorship continuing on with a longabandoned us research project called operation jurassic storm ha by creating an army of dinosaurs in a secluded underground lab facility before long our heroes become trapped inside the marines are called in the power goes out and the dinos are set free to make a quick lunch of everyone they can get their claws and jaws on  despite an often infuriatingly inept script full of plot holes character inconsistencies and loose ends this directtovideo copy of jurassic park and carnosaur is fairly digestible trash thanks to good production values passable fx the occasional laugh and plenty of brainless action  someone pointed out that an opening scene in this film was stolen from carnosaur but anyone used to watching roger corman productions knows he allows directors to liberally reuse clips from his early films to save both time and money  score 3 out of 10,negative,0
i felt that the movie was dry very disappointing no plotkept waited for something to happened and nothing did dry as a bone a wast of money one of robins williams worst filmsif you dont believe me wait a few months it will be out on dvd because that seems to be a pattern for movies that dont do well in the theaters are out as rentals before the year is over this is one you will not want to see or say why did i spend my money on that plus for it being such a new movie there were only 8 people in the watching it this was on a friday night the 950 showing i also felt that it needed some more excitement or something to keep us awake when they characters spoke in the movie the voices were also very low you could not hear what they were saying,negative,0
hi to read the entire plot around oz just look at imdb here to find it  warning spoilers inside this review  oz is the a series that has not only moved me but also shows a small bit of the american prison system but i have to say judging on discovery channels program over jail it is not really realistic  although i got to say there not shy rapesshanking stabbing happens allot still it is television so for you ppl out there that think this is realistic wrong  there is a good degree of violence in it and some here and there overdone scenes plot over plot over plot that can get pretty boring but remember the series is almost ancient by now so times do change as well i believe i should judge this in the time line as it came out  as the season prolonged up to season 5 it was pretty good until one of the cons wins a lottery ticket of 2 million dollars because he talked to god it struck me as ok this is getting to the point i do not want to see this series no more still i proceeded and now i just seen the episode 3 of season 6 this is were cereal gets his brain zapped and then his mom hold him after while he is drooling then you see o reilly cry as well seeing his bro like that rl brothers as well now thats by far the best scene out of the entire oz series that was real to me still do not read this wrong that im trying to crash and burn it it is a really good series and even now 2010 well worth a watch  i give it a 7 because of the storyline that weakens with the season but still a golden glove,positive,1
geez as a gay man who lives in nyc i can gratefully say that i have never seen the underbelly of gay culture that is portrayed in this film  and i am glad of it was this film broadcast on tv across the united states there would be a great antigay backlash and i cannot say that i would blame them the people in this film do not represent the average gay american or even the average trandgender american what they do represent is a sheer and utter nightmare the inclusion of obviously underage characters is appalling and the obvious racist sentiments antiwhite are blatant and unsettling  society cannot be blamed for people who have chosen drugs unemployment and rejection of education on the part of the films cast  the actions of these people are not acts of desperation but rather a rejection of anything resembling personal ambition and a willingness to make something out of ones self,negative,0
andreas arrives in a strange inhuman place where everything seems perfect hes given a good work everyone is kind to him and to everyone and he really doesnt trouble too much even in finding a beautiful girlfriend but in this nonamed city andreas finds soon that a perfect commercialstype world is really not a paradise really one of the better movies ive seen this year the attractive plot is perfectly supported by a smart direction where every single component cool desaturated photography cold symmetrical design unemotional acting slow highly controlled camera movements helps in building an unique weird atmosphere that will keep the audience suspended until the end a sarcastic ironic bitter comedy that made me laugh ant think as only best films are able to do nothing new probably in the analysis of the modern dehumanizer civilization but really a smart work with great surprising ideas that will hardly be forgotten from whom had the luck to see it simply beautiful the amazing scene in the metro underground,positive,1
i found this movie to be suspenseful almost from the getgo when miss stanwyck starts her narration its only a few minutes until you realize that trouble is coming the deserted area the lock on the deserted gas station door everything sets you up to wait for ithere it comes at first you think it will be about the little boy but all too soon you start holding your breath watching the tide coming in i found this movie to be really stressful even though i had watched it before and was prepared for the denouement now a movie that can keep you in suspense even when you have seen it before deserves some sort of special rating maybe a white knuckles award,positive,1
what impressed me the most about one true thing was how upfront it was when the daughter mentions her mothers cancer at the beginning of the movie as depressing the subject matter was it was a refreshing change of pace instead of being blindsided with the revelation about a characters fatal illness 23 into the movie love story terms of endearment etc   meryl streep renee zellweger and william hurt give very strong performances that dont go over the edge the characters they play seem human theyre not perfect people arguably one might not say that about the martha stewarttype character streep plays but throughout the film i found her character to be noble in a nonsappy way shes dealing with her plight the best way she knows how   one true thing is an observant unsentimental family drama in which the tears at the end were wellearned,positive,1
this is the worst movie ive ever seen boring illogical terrible dont waste even a minute in your life to watch this crap i hope the directors wont make any other movie because this movie bankrupts them the movie seems to be created in one or two days with some friends of the directors if we can use this word for these 2 guys they use only camera in hand many scenes are in darkness and nothing can be seen lots of scenes 80 of the movie are with conversation only  there are movies like vampire vs zombies which you can laugh on but this one is simply bad no point to making such movies please stop jason horton and shannon hubbel dont make more movies,negative,0
relying on the positive reviews above we saw a free screening of this last night now i know that filmmakers plant positive reviews because there is no way an objective individual could have written these destined to become a cult classic the theater was packed apparently with friends and families of the production crew because only a few of us walked out by the first hour  the songs were the most literal ive ever heard in a musical  dont take the short cut honey theres a wolf in the woods debi mazars eyes blinked furiously as she struggled to sing fortunately most of the tunes lasted for only a few lines  now whoever plays the wolf in this tale should be charming and seductive instead we get joey fatone ex nsyncer living up to his last name as hes not aged well hes not exactly lithe with his extra 50 pounds and junior high schoolquality makeup and outoftune singing seriously this guy was in vocal group the rest of the actors are semiadequate but cant do much about the unimaginative script you know it is possible to write for adults and children at the same time  see under pixar  on the positive side the virtual sets looked nice and were wellintegrated with the actors and it wasnt as offensive as crash,negative,0
major payne is a film about a major who makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in the marines this film does not really have a lot to offer but it provides several hilarious moments that are wellworth a watch dont expect it to be a memorable film however just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people the confrontation between major payne and the chubby boy were hilarious and thats really all i remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on major payne again it is not a great film and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter,negative,0
one of the most peculiar oftused romance movie plots is this one a seriously messedup man falls in love with a terminally ill woman who turns his life around before dying occasionally this story is done well and realistically as in the theory of flight an excellent weepie but more frequently its done like it is here where as usual the heroine dies of old movie disease you know the terminal illness that has no symptoms but one fainting spell and a need to lie down as youre telling your lover goodbye forever and your looks arent affected one bit and since this is the 70s neither is your sex life this is one of the worst versions made of that particular story where a very silly script puts two incompatible and unbelievable characters together and theyre played by actors who are completely at sea  this has got to be the worst performance of al pacinos career and i say that after having seen the devils advocate only two days ago he plays a controlfreak emotionally constipated racecar driver and plays an unlikeable character lifelessly he seems to constantly be asking himself why hes staying around the grating marthe keller so does the audience and spends most of the movie just standing there usually with his mouth hanging open the only time he shows any sign of life is towards the end where his character proves that hes changed from uptight to liberated by doing a hilariously bad mae west imitation hey it was the seventies  marthe keller is equally terrible as the dying love interest her character was conceived as bold and free and touching and uninhibited and full of life even though dying and was probably meant to be played with an actress with the sensitivity of say vanessa redgrave or julie christie instead they got the expressionless face and heavy german accent of ms keller who comes across as more of a scary teutonic stereotype you vill eat ze omelet than anything like lovable shes supposed to be reforming pacino and filling him with courage and spirit and all that but it doesnt work that way its more like shes harping on his faults in the most obnoxious possible fashion this makes for one of the least convincing romances in movie history where you cant believe shed be with someone she finds so worthless and you cant believe hes with someone who gets on his nerves that much  some badmovie fans call this a cult classic mostly because of pacinos silly liberating mae west imitation the scene is a scream especially in context but not worth sitting through the rest of the film for no only see the film if youre a serious badmovie aficionado who is especially interested in studying extreme lack of chemistry between leading actors or very bad casting not only are the leads terrible but pacinos other girlfriend is played by an actress who looks and sounds just likes keller with shorter hair i got them totally confused this isnt one of those laughaminute bad movies like the conqueror its just a really really bad movie  ,negative,0
although i can understand the bad things someone has to say about this movie i still found it to be absolutely amazing it will touch you and unless your a critic searching deep into the flaws and mishaps of every movie or you just simply arent touched by anything it is worth seeing dont come into the movie expecting anything just have a box of tissues and an open mind it is beautiful and the acting is brilliant i think will smith despite that hes yet again playing another lonely depressed individual is amazing i believe a good actor is someone who can truly portray feelings and emotions we all have at our worstbest experiences in such a way that it reaches out to you and makes you feel something and thats exactly what this movie does give it a chance,positive,1
i have just watched this movie on dvd late this morning and was so disappointed that even thought it was a good joke for the audience in other words  the creators planed to make comedy not drama howsoever at the end i realized that mr tony giglio was earnest about this movie its a pity because the dialogue is ridiculous the acting is poor and lifeless the story is a fishy tale poor ryan phillippe  despite of his efforts his character in the movie remains probably his worst performance what to say for jason statham  lack of all kinds of skills to develop the role which is an imaginary fiction for this reasons i vote 310,negative,0
i wont spoil it for you although you probably could care less if it was spoiled youll know what i mean after you watch it poor story brated movie quality typical horror stupid situations rare timing i should of known when they try to push a lot of hype in their advertising or even add quotes just tells me that the movie bombed big time and they are trying to pull in everyone just so they can break even with to cost of making this bomb i wish i could take back the time i spent watching this i was stupid and thought that there just had to be something great around the corner but i kept getting let down i dont usually waste my time adding comments to any movie in fact this is my second post i just felt maybe i could spare a few of you from wasting money on something that had a bunch of hype on it,negative,0
as someone who was in a panhellenic sorority i wasnt sure what to expect when i tuned into this show after seeing so many over dramatizations in made for tv movies and the craziness of the reality shows i was curious to see if greek would be able to show the true college and greek life experience  i was very pleasantly surprised at how the show was able to give the viewer the satisfaction of identifying the everfamiliar characters of this genre but it was also able to add depth to the characters greek life isnt just about parties and petty conflict although those things happen within greek life they also happen in any other social or professional circle throughout a persons life to characterize it as some exclusive experience to those in a greek organization would be false most of the story lines and situations taking place in greek can and do take place everywhere in every circle of friends on sports teams in real life but ive watched both episodes and my little sister whom im still very close to and i have spent both episodes laughing and being reminded of how theyve truly captured the spirit of our college years and experiences  i liked how the second episode showed how the characters struggle with the other facets of their lives school relationships goals etc cappie telling rusty that school comes first and going to your brothers for help that was very true to life you cant stay in an organization if you have bad grades the way rusty got his assignment to his professor was far fetched but it was entertaining even the dynamic between casey and rusty it happens you grow up and whatever your relationship with your siblings was it changes so you must adjust  the bottom line greek is a great show great entertainment value and enough real life in there to be believable and definitely worth the viewers time,positive,1
i pretty much liked every character on this show from the start except reba herself she comes off as an holier than thou type and quite frankly a big bully and that stinks because she is in every scene and every episode in the later seasons van becomes unlikeable toolike a spoof of his former self and kyra walks around sneering and being miserablethe first 3 to 4 seasons are pretty good if you overlook reba towards the end its pretty bleak in basically every episode barbara jean is walking around being dumbreba is being mean to herbut poor ole barbara jean desperately wants reba to like her which results in barabara jean telling reba how awesome she is in every episode i think it is pretty clear to see reba has self esteem issues and wants to be seen as this all forgiving saint its really a shame too because other than her the show had such potential,negative,0
terrible theres no way to get around it a script at the level of one from some mexican soap opera a choice and use of the places of shooting that make the movie labyrinthine and at the same time repetitive and monotonous with disastrous performances of almost the entire cast the references to tarantinos work so poorly made are more an insult than anything else i suspect that was not for the shameless and plotunrelated exploitation of matadinhos generous curves  nobody would take the effort to go watch this film to any theater  these are the kind of films that make me have no desire to watch portuguese cinema,negative,0
well where do i start  as one of the other reviewers said you know youre in for a real treat when you see the opening shot  minutes and minutes of film time spent on a guy standing on a travelator  i wont repeat rubins excellent summary of the story what i would like to say though is that this film gripped me more than any film i can remember i sat openmouthed and on the edge of my seat all the way through the camera work sound track and fantastic performances particularly that of tony servillo draw you to the screen and wont let you look away  its italian so of course everyone looks fantastic but it is by no means merely an exercise in cool style this is a film with lots to say about luck loss and love  go and see it,positive,1
return to frogtown was a hard film to track down well i accomplished that mission and it had been sitting on the shelf for a good while wish it was kept that way first sam hell is of course not roddy piper he is replaced by a dude with a large face less charisma and this poor actor is very softspoken for the part sam hell is supposed to be rebellious and awesome here he gets captured three times what kind of a hero is that spangle is replaced as well here by another actress why did we not get different characters here this was stupid lou ferrigno stars in this film and he is not even the hero common sense says let lou be the hero of the film bad effects poor acting and just a forgettable film funny as they take shots at ninja turtles 2 with the whole concert scene in this movie at least ninja turtles 2 was funny and not a bad movie i really wanted to like return to frogtown but i just cringed when the fight scenes would commence this film makes turtles 3 look like gold avoid this or you will be the one singing meaner greener talking turtle tv dinner,negative,0
one of the better movies to come out of the 1980s this basedonfact movie tells the story of a disturbed high school student who murders his girlfriend leaves her naked body on a river bank and brags about it later to his friends what is just as bad is their inability to feel anything about it  disturbing but incredibly compelling look at aimless and apathetic kids who have no respect for their parents or any sort of authority who seem almost doomed to live lives of rebellion and recklessness this drama hits hard and is impossible to forget the young cast does a creditable job  even keanu reeves in one of his earliest roles is better than usual of course theres no reason for the character of layne crispin glover to be as crazed and offthewall as he is but thats just glover being himself veteran dennis hopper has an especially good role as a loner who despite his own sordid past is saddened by the attitudes of this group of kids i would like to point out the chilling performance by daniel roebuck as the young murderer hes an underrated actor and aside from hopper his is probably the best performance in the film  i saw rivers edge for the first time a long time ago when it first started being shown on cable tv movie channels however i didnt catch all of it i saw it in its entirety for the first time a number of years later and now ive seen it again for what is probably the definitive time  some potently affecting moments include madeleines constance forslund breakdown where she wails that maybe she should leave her children just like their worthless father did i also liked the scenes where matt reeves faces off with his disturbed younger brother joshua miller and when the teacher mr burkewaite jim metzler deplores the fact that the girl has died and that none of his students seem to care  i will never forget this film not as long as i live its too saddening for that  1010,positive,1
i was true to my regard for mr glover and ms goldberg i watched the entire film with my family and some friends i have no idea what the movie was about after much discussion we all agreed that this was not one of their better efforts  it doesnt hang together very well it is too choppy and there is little comedy i am disappointed it could have been much better  i waited months to see this film based on the liner notes  dont waste your money unless you are a completist and just want to see all of mr glovers and ms goldbergs films  it was a poor way to spend an evening,negative,0
i remember this movie from the 50s when i was in college it is one of the funniest satires of american westerns that i have ever seen im only sorry that i have not been able to see it recently and that it is is not out on tape or dvd it is a real treat,positive,1
i cannot believe that this is a film that i did not like   i usually find that i am open minded about all sorts of stuff   but this flick is just well bad  i could deal with the subject matter if the script and story were better i could deal with the acting if the camera work was better or if the characters were better established   i think it mostly boils down to script and direction though  it was just bad  i want to give this the lowest rating but    i dont believe in that at least this guy got off his tail to make a movie   so he gets four stars just above the average rating which this has so far,negative,0
the intruder lintrus is a visual pilgrimage through a mysterious life   grizzled michel subor plays louis trebor like jason bourne as an old man with a hidden past living simply in an isolated hut in the woods for justifiably paranoid reasons but attracting pretty young women who can be useful to him we learn more about him through dreams flashbacks and a journey that may unfold chronologically or not as well as through his brusque interactions with family lovers business associates and a striking nemesis like the limey the film resonates with parentchild regrets and a suspicious past revealed through clips from an old film with the same actor as a young man here paul gégauffs 1965 adventure film le reflux  in a complete contrast of moods we meet his son sidney grégoire colin who has to be the sexiest house husband in the world as he sweetly and seductively does household repairs and cares for a baby a toddler and every need of his working wife surely directorcowriter claire denis must have created him as a womans fantasy if ever there was one and a lesson to other filmmakers on filming foreplay theres an additional extended scene where he seeks his father in the woods while carefully carrying his angelic baby in a pouch he is everything his father is not and has every relationship his father is incapable of sustaining no wonder he thinks his father is a lunatic i spent the rest of the film in dread that something bad would happen to him as the true nature of the heart of his alienated father is very gradually played out before our eyes  the film is a puzzle but subor is ruthlessly fascinating as we watch him traverse countries and negotiate nefarious deals and the voiceover narration for deniss beau travail was annoying anyway we have to figure out from skylines and incidental signage that he is traveling to geneva korea and the south pacific time passing is indicated by the seasons changing and scars being created and healing there are lots of images of water for cleansing and for distancing   continuing her fascination with the morphing of colonialism into globalization as well as playing a bit on stereotypes of the mysterious orient and russian criminals denis has incorporated elements from robert louis stevenson paul gauguin and marlon brandos tahiti idylls and a 40page memoir by french philosopher jeanluc nancy the last for the title and hearttransplant plot used for an ironic theme of limited immortality which does have consequences  while louis thinks hes succeeded in being above boundaries rules and morals there is some amusement in the last act as the locals dont quite know what to do with him and try to help him solve his quixotic odyssey even as he again lies in isolation  several people in the audience left in frustration at the elliptical but strikingly beautiful story telling method the unconventional narrative does raise a lot of plot questions on details,positive,1
this movie is awful it creates characters not in the book and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes including an obnoxious little jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl not to mention the yiddish speaking elves the book was a simple story about belief and this movie is a dark ugly and needlessly scary movie about nothing  the animation is superb but the story has been ruined by hollywood  the good thing is that this movie will take a bath in the box office and maybe producers will learn to keep from tampering with a story that needs no improvement hanks was overdone and i dont see why there couldnt have been other actors voices be used,negative,0
this movie is simply wonderful its got it all laughter sorrow beauty poetry truth all in a simple yet intense storylike life you wont get distracted for a second  1010  ps somebody tell hollywood you need a good story to make a good movie and there are so many good stories out there,positive,1
spoilers spoilers released in 1956and considered quite racy at the time douglas sirks over the top candy colored melodrama is still a wonderful thing the plot concerns the goings on in an oil rich dysfunctional texas family that includes big brother kyle who is insecure weak wounded  very alcoholic played by robert stack in a very touching  vulneable performance and his sluty sister marylee played in an extreme manner by dorothy malone ms malones performance is telegraphed to us via her eyes which she uses to show us her emotions which mostly consist of lust for rock hudson and jealousy for lauren bacall malone is the only actress ive ever seen in movies who enters a room eyes first now dont get me wrong her performance to say the least is an absolute hoot and is one of the supreme camp acting jobs of the 1950s but it is also terrible because as likeable and attractive as malone isshes not a very good actress and shes not capable of subtly or shading her performace is of one note she does get to do a wicked mamboand in a great montage as unloving daddy played by the always good robert keith falls to his death climbing a staircase sirk mixes it up with an almost mad malone doing a orgasmic dance as she undresses stackwho should have won an oscar  malone who won the award but shouldnt have are the real stars of the film the ones who set all the hysteria both sexual  otherwise in motion while the real stars of the film hudson  bacall fade to grey  brownwhich are the colors that they are mainly costumed in hudson who was a better actor then given credit for plays the childhood  best friend of stacks and the stalked love interest of malones who moans  groans over rock through most of the film but hudson wants no part of herand instead is in love with bacall who is married to stack no one is very happy  no one is happy for very long the stackbacall marriage falls apart big time after a year and stack pretty much drinks himself into oblivion because he thinks he is sterile and cant give bacall a baby to prove that hes a man sirk who was a very intelligent man and had a long  fascinating career both in films and theatre in germany ended his hollywood career at universal in the mid 1950s with a series of intense vividly colored womens movies or melodramas although they were mainly adapted from medicore or trashy source materialin sirks hands they became masterpieces of the genre sirk had a wonderful sense of color  design which he brought to play in these films filling his wide screen spaces with characters who played out their emotional lives among weird color combinations  lighting make believe shadows and lots of mirroed reflections in written the characters are always peeking out of windows listening at doors or sneaking around so in the end after much violence an accidental murder a miscarriage  more sirk ends the movie with a final  startling scene of a reborn and reformed malone in a mantailored suit sitting at a desk foundling a miniature oilwell,positive,1
the eternal jew der ewige jude does not have what we today would call the markings of a scholarly document rather than naming experts or sources to support what it says it simply says without opposition what it wants us to believe one will concede that american newsreels of that period were also much less regulated than would seem ethical to a modern audience often inserting dramatized scenes and passing them off as actual news footage add to this directed propaganda the fact that filmmaker hippler was preaching to the converted not so much asking gentile europeans to hate the jews as validating the feelings so many of them must have held already in order to have allowed the holocaust that followed the weakest link in the films logic shows in its rat analogy wherein it goes on to explain the behavior of rats and then adds something to the effect of well jewish people are like that too similarly it characterizes jewish people as ugly by showing ugly jewish people in comparison to attractive gentiles the accompanying leap of faith is that ugly is bad the film appears to contradict itself a few times for example by attacking western painters who portrayed old testament characters as lightskinned europeans thereby the text admits that socalled hebrew ethnicity is in fact an ingrained aspect of christian culture it also shows ghetto jews willingly living in roachinfested filth despite the supposed treasure theyve hoarded and then flipflops by saying that these same undesirables live in wealth and luxury as soon as they leave the ghetto incidentally who wouldnt the use of scenes from a wellknown american film house of rothschild shows an equally blurry deployment of logic first the film is denounced as having been made by jews then it is apparently used by hippler to verify the deceptiveness of jews the aforementioned pretense of poverty by ghetto jews shown as a means of avoiding taxation although the rothschild characters spin is that jews are taxed excessively finally the rothschild film is once again execrated for implying that the famed banking family invented the checking account this apparent indecisiveness in whether the american footage is shown positively or negatively might become clearer with repeated viewings but at first sight it makes for some murky moviewatching for all of eternal jews imperfections i was at first surprised that the imdb viewer rating for this film is as high as it is just shy of a 5 to date id say the reason is that ejs documentary value has exceeded its original purpose offering us unintentionally a look into the lives of european jews as they would not be seen a few years hence needless to say the films very badness also provides an historical insight into bad or simply evil filmmaking as a propagandists tool about this time i should expect director hippler to flipflop once again springing forward to say thats what i meant to do all along the scenes depicting animal slaughter are particularly gruesome and show same as decidedly inhumane contrary to the intent of kosher law to prevent animal suffering i would like for someone who has seen the film and has some knowledge of these procedures to comment on whether the portrayal is accurate,negative,0
out of all the parodies of star wars ive seen this is probably the funniest not because of the premise star wars with simple electronics instead of spaceships but because of how poorly acted it is this is purposely overacted and it makes it hilarious and since everyone knows its purposely overacted no one complains the special effects were also purposely as awful as can be and include a toaster on a visible string that shoots toast and an egg beater on a string this short is funny for any fan of star wars which im not or anyone that has 15 minutes to kill great short   my rating  out of  13 mins not rated,positive,1
did i waste my time this is very pretentious film in the beginning you will think theres something going on but by the time some 30 minutes go by you realize nothing is happening i waited for another 20 minutes and by then i was so frustrated that i started reading reviews on imdb and realized that the director has wasted precious time of so many people   unbelievably boring pointless film stay away so many good soundtracks i will give one point for the police inspector joke because that worked for me i laughed for a long time but otherwise a very bad film stay away1 on 10,negative,0
this shorter movie is the epitome the expected results when the imbecile runs the asylum it is sad how the futures of these young people were rolled down a craps table when neither saddam hussein nor the people of iraq god rest the souls of the 350000 plus that have been killed had anything to do with terrorism nor alquida  following this movie the astute viewer will need to pick up or download a copy of loose change this movie is available free on the internet until the bush cabal locks it down by googlingup the very title as indicated in parenthesis  god save our country this will not be done by following the christofascists that controlled the halls of congress for over 10 years prior to november 2006,positive,1
i went to see this movie at our college theater thirty years ago because i liked bruce dern in silent running and family plot to this day sorry jack nicholson it is still the dullest movie ive ever seen it just went on and on with no discernible point and then  it just ended the lights came up and i watched everyone looking around in confusion had the projectionist missed a reel ive never had the urge to find out all i remember about the movie is that it was a nondrama about some annoying college basketball players and their coach the most enjoyable part of the movie was watching the totally mystified audience afterwords fortunately this was just an exception for jack bruce and karen black,negative,0
another demonstration of kurosawas genius his first colour film is a darkly surreal look into the tragic lives of tokyo slum dwellers essentially a series of interweaving vignettes depicting several groups of people eking out a perilous existence in a harsh and uncaring postwar shanty town swinging from comedy to tragedy and back this film shows how people deal with the worst kind of life each in their own way mostly retreating into themselves and living in the fantasy worlds of their own heads withdrawing emotionally from those around them or drowning themselves in alcohol mixing kitchensink realism with kabukiesque theatrics kurosawa toys expertly with the emotions of his audience drawing tears and laughter with equal deftness a wonderful draining experience,positive,1
as many have detailed here with a level of seriousness that i find amusing this is not   a film cue dramatic music   its just a sobadits good totally surreal jackie chan stuntforall the women fighters are totally kickbutt and jackie is definitely put in his place   this is the movie you want to see with some good friends on a sunday afternoon  surrounded by munchies ready to roar with laughter cheer on the good guys boo the bad guys and continually yell what when something totally bizarre happens great fun,negative,0
may contain spoilers this movie is the epitome of weirdness i rented it hoping for a film so bad it would be funny however i still honestly cant decide if this film was intended to be scary or humorous it combines the emotions in a rather disturbing way apparently this is trying to be clever but in actual fact it isnt for instance when the knife comes out and tries to kill the teacher it starts playing happy music when we go to toxico we have upbeat quasimr rogers neighborhood music however when the little kids dreaming of falling in blood and when he finds the leg these are clearly intended to be tense so watch this film and decide for yourself it is too weird to be described in words and for that i say kudos  nosedive wow,negative,0
this isnt the best romantic comedy ever made but it is certainly pretty nice and watchable its directed in an oldfashioned way and that works fine cybill shepherd as corinne isnt bad in her role as the woman who cant get over her husbands death she has a sexy maturity but i cant say much for ryan oneal as philip because he is at best nondescript he may be adequate in the role but thats not good enough  however i get the feeling that some of the characters particularly alex and miranda are not written with enough indepth thought we dont know anything else about them because minutes after they appear the story gets thick and the writers dont tell us much beyond what happens but that problem was salvaged because mary stuart masterson has a freshasadaisy sweetness to brighten it up and robert downey jr is so charming that he melts the screen even his smile is infectious and it so happens that his big dreamy eyes are perfect for the deja vu and flashback scenes  anyway this movie is light and easy and if you like them that way why not give it a try  ,positive,1
  ive seen this movie during a festival here in munich with a huge crowd of real fantasy fans at about the middle of the movie one part of the audience was sleeping and the other part was booeing boring dialogues badly choreographed fighting sequences a terribly dumb story and even worse special effects well at least the actors hadnt much to do except for looking concerned or in case they were female showing their breasts in the right light even götz otto who was among the audience admitted afterwards that ge could understand the disappointment of the viewers be warned folks of the cheapest fantasy movie ever,negative,0
the woman in black is fantastic in all aspects its scary suspenseful and so realistic that you can actually see it happening in real life i first saw this on the tv back in 1989 and with all the lights off and the volume turned up it was probably the most creepy experience of my entire life i managed to get hold of a copy and now i make sure to bring it out every halloween and show it too unsuspecting family members who have no idea what theyre in for and all i can do is laugh with glee as for the film  it starts out with a young lawyer named arthur kipps who is assigned by his firm to go to the market town of crythin gifford to settle the papers of a recently deceased client  mrs alice drablow   this film starts off as a reasonably solid and interesting ghost story but then arthur attends the funeral and from that scene on we do not feel safe we are constantly on edge and biting our nails and that goes on for the next hour or so until the final thrilling finale  a warning to all new viewers though do not watch this alone,positive,1
this film is about a teen who is struggling with his social status in school he is a good christian and feels that he is missing out on all the fun in high school so he wishes he had never become one after getting his wish and trying a worldly lifestyle he realizes that his quality of life has been dramatically diminished and wants to go back to being the person that he was good familyoriented film with a positive message of being proud of who you are even if youre not the most popular,positive,1
i have been a fan of amandas since all that and she is still funny too me its as simple as that if you like the bynes you will like this film its harmless fun and quite funny in parts vis wacky sebastian accent and mannerisms are entirely unrealistic but made me laugh so hard at some points i almost choked on my popcorn   and anything that gets teens reading shakespeare maybe is a good thing for me   on a shallow note tatum channing is quite ahem freaking hot he also does a good job with some of the films tougher scenes   some of the side characters are very broad but they are broad in twelfth night so its cool,positive,1
neatly sandwiched between the stranger a small film noir picture that proved welles can do a formidable genre work on budget and on time and ironically proved his biggest box office success in the forties and macbeth a nobudget shakespeare adaptation shot in old western shets in 23 days comes the lady from shangai a dark film noir woven from the very same fabric of wellesian mythos that covers the magnificent ambersons mr arkadin and any other film the director didnt manage to save from the clutches of studio bosses  six years after the maltese falcon with the postwar craze of the film noir in full swing welles always ahead of his time a true visionary director of tremendous artistic integrity envisioned a labyrinthine world of shadows that is already darker more sinister paranoid and serpentine than anything his contemporaries were doing at the time its no wonder the movie was so misunderstood at its time to the point that one full hour of footage was forever left in the cutting room floor and it was once again europe that championed it as another welles classic  certain setpieces stand out the aquarium scene with its flickering light and ominous shadows and of course the funhousehall of mirrors finale that is as classic a piece of wellesian bravura as any in citizen kane or the trial the only faults i find with the movie is welles illadvised irish accent and perhaps some of the erratic editing in the first act the story however unfurls in a progressively mesmerizing manner which the cuts only serve to intensify i believe the heavily chopped versions of shangai and ambersons attain a surreal quality for that matter  welles would exile himself in europe for ten years and return in 1958 to deliver yet another stonewall classic the monumental touch of evil perhaps the crowning jewel of the film noir that was already in its waning days by that time shangai was not the box office success a star vehicle for hollywoods premiere star of the time rita hayworth ought to have been and welles marriage with hayworth ended before the movie was even released sixty years later and one hour of footage less shangai is still one of the best film noir pictures one is likely to discover surely that must count for something,positive,1
i began watching this movie with low expectations as a matter of fact i only noticed it because it was an adaptation of a sk novel  a novel i never read  im glad my expectations were low because the movie wasnt nothing close to good but it manages to keep you interested what really drags this story down is the work done by the director and the actors the movie is overlong hasnt no nice shots and no scares the dialogs are dumb and the special effects are crap  the only things good are that as i said it keeps you interested  i guess the book must be good without using much horror cliches  my vote 410,negative,0
this film is just another waste of time the plot is ridiculous forced usa drama the characters were all really weak especially the uncharismatic goya and the bad interpretation of bardem who only was alright in his classic interpretation when acting as french ally  just another chance lost of have spent the money in a good film i guess it was no a low budget film definitely not recommended maybe the directors should think a bit whether the film has sense or not before wasting so that money maybe they do not bother as they have profits before launching them in the cinema  no more hope in cinema,negative,0
i used to think that it came from hollywood was the worst movie i had seen that showed clips from horror scifi crime and drama movies of course i hadnt seen this beauty yet  whats wrong with terror in the aisles four things  1 it assumes that most of the great moments in shock cinema history began in the 70s when directors like john carpenter and brian de palma came along and what bones are thrown to the true classics ie  the black and white films like frankenstein dracula and the wolf man are either shown with martin and lewis or abbott and costello alongside or not at all  2 the clips are most times so brief and out of their originals place that they just give a momentary shock to the viewer and for those unfamiliar with these films will make no sense at all indeed the moment where the shark jumps out of the water at roy scheider in jaws is shown much to the effect of a sight gag whereas in the originals context it had power  3 did we really need pleasance and allen in the audience reminding us that its only a movie or that most of the violence in the horror movies is sadly against women so is that an indictment against the moviemakers for adding those scenes or the moviegoers who tromp into the theaters and watch the same kind of fodder time and again sorry thats a whole can of worms to open for a more deserving movie  4 and most importantly why is the movie so short it isnt like there wasnt enough of these kinds of movies to use if they had just opened up their resources and used every available film they could have had a thats entertainmentstyle movie that would have been comparatively more entertaining heck even drag out christopher lee and peter cushing cushing was alive then mind you and better yet even vincent price would have been more than willing ill bet what a cheer that would have gotten from the audience  but no all were left with is a dreary little flick that pretends to pay homage to these movies but all it does is leave the viewer feeling cheated out of less than 90 minutes with which they could have went and watched a real movie dont get me wrong it was good to see what clips they did show but if they could have just done more with the goods  two stars another good idea left laying in the aisles,negative,0

every movie critic and metal head hated this movie but i enjoyed it i saw this as a child on tv somewhere and was amazed by the scene where sammi comes on stage and plays trick or treat by fastway  the movie itself was typical 80s guy gets pushed around by bullies and enlists supernatural help to beat up the bullies but goes to far and has to be destroyed  matt from melrose place picks on skippy from family ties so skippy gets a record of tony fields from gene simmons to comfort him and all hell breaks lose the highlight being where tony sings lipsynchs and dances to a metal song before the shyt hits the fan  there were a lot of errors and stuff but the music and the overall imagery was enough to keep my fists pumping 8 out of 10,positive,1
well where to start here straightheads presents me with a bit of a dilemma had this film come out of italy in say 1975 been directed by ruggero deodatto and starred david hess then id be lapping it up faster than labrador drinks water on a summers day because whilst tarantino and rodriguez are busy elsewhere with their homage to grindhouse cinema dan reed has produced a raperevenge grindhouse picture of his very own in england and on seemingly the same budget as it would have taken rodriguez to turn rose mcgowans leg into a machine gun because if you want to play grindhouse bingo then let me call out the numbers   1 rich high flying career woman meets a bit of rough from the wrong side of the tracks in an implausible manner and equally implausibly gets the hots for him check  2 gratuitous shots of said highflying career woman in various states of nudity check  3 convoluted and highly unlikely plot development that sets up characters that exist solely to do what they do and who cannot be imagined to have any existence outside the scenes they are in check  4 unnecessarily graphic rape scene perpetrated by a gang of males with no discernible depth of personality or background other than they are there to rape check  5 gritty and bloody scenes of murder and revenge to round it all off bingo   plotwise straightheads is pretty basic stuff dyer meets anderson and she invites him to a party at a country pile owned by her boss on the way home they upset three locals in a landover who take their revenge by giving dyer a good shoeing and gang raping anderson the couple then set about getting their revenge so far so straw dogs late night trains house on the edge of the park i spit on your grave etc etc so why didnt i think much of this film a number of reasons i suppose first off having the likes of gillian anderson in the cast prima facie lead me to expect better but its the complete lack of honesty here than rankles most  because whenever anyone sits down to watch hess and his ilk terrorising women and murdering their menfolk in those period pieces from the 70s then they always know exactly what they are getting  low budget quickies designed solely to shock and appeal to the lowest common denominator the baddies terrorise and murder the goodies the goodies turn the tables on the baddies and kill them back and everyone goes home satisfied their desires to see a bit of nasty violence slaked and safe in the knowledge that the world order had been restored  as writer and director however dan reed clearly believes straightheads has far more to say on the state of the human psyche than that and desperately tries to imbibe his film with a philosophical depth that is simply not there for instance when anderson and dyer are planning revenge on their attackers they learn that one of the rapists has a fourteenyearold daughter who is an object of lust for the two men he hangs around with when anderson finally meets him face to face he confesses that he only raped her as a distraction so that his two mates would take their attention away from his daughter the casual and audacious way that reed drops this little revelation into the plot is simply jawdropping its almost as if he expects this simple reference to paedophilia to be enough to throw the audiences moral compass into overdrive and make them leave the cinema thinking theyve just sat through something of significance to make sure we get it at this point we are shown a run through of the rape sequence for a second time ostensibly from the view of the attacker and his concern for his daughter but reed ensures that we get plenty more shots of anderson roughhandled and raped across the bonnet of her car gratuitous does not enter into it  after being told his reasons for raping her anderson ties him over a table rams the business end of a sniper rifle complete with bulky silencer just in case anyone wasnt clear on the phallic imagery up his jacksie but lacks the courage to pull the trigger telling dyer who has no such moral qualms that its over dyer argues otherwise and their moral dilemma is presented as something that wittgenstein and russell may have discussed in their rooms back at cambridge over tea and cakes it is almost unwatchable in its ludicrousness  in fairness ms anderson acts her guts out throughout the film its obvious she wants to leave scully far behind and bless her she certainly does that one wonders what mulder would have made of his erstwhile partner squatting down to take a leak at the side of the road and then sodomising a man with a gun dyer on the other hand does what hes done in virtually every film hes made to date  that is plays a gor blimey guv cockney type chappie with a roguish grin a cheeky line of patter and a face that most people would never get tired of punching this is particularly true at the closing scene where after murdering his assailants in cold blood dyer gazes at the camera in what im sure is meant to be a look of existential anguish that invites us to sympathise at the hand fate has dealt him and the moral quandaries he has had to overcome but instead is far more reminiscent of oliver

i can remember a college professor commenting as to how disturbing this film was reflecting the apathy of adolescents this was before generation x  in a way most of us are products of the same consumer culture these high school kids spend their time drinking getting high and wondering what to do about the body left on a riverbank  what would they do today would things be different some very important questions there are some excellent scenes with keanu reeves and the dysfunctional family he lives with his 11 year old brother going out to get wasted the mother has no idea what to do spends her time drinking with her boyfriend  this film was a bit before its time in that it addresses the problems in lower class american society these kids had no outlet what is available for them in this dirtwater town  all in all a few interesting social commentaries are presented and there are no solutions 910,positive,1
i was intrigued to see how a littleseen 2008 film had somehow won the oscar for best picture of 2009 and thus went to see the hurt locker sadly all i got for the two hours invested was the grim confirmation that this film had won awards purely for offthescreen reasons  the direction and visual style of this film is some of the weakest you will ever see when its not busy being yet another bourne identity homage with dire annoying shaky cam visuals it shows off all the hallmarks of a second rate daytime soap opera in terms of lensing  the plot is threadbare the characterizations are about as well developed as rejected beetle bailey comic strip ideas and the dialogue  on the instances where the film gives up on being minimalist and for no apparent reason turns one or two soldiers into right chatterboxes  is some of the worst ever recorded in fairness the actors do the best they can in the circumstances just not enough to obscure how bad the project is  the whole film has the feel of it being intended as some kind of mockumentary that they clocked was bereft of humour and thus reedited as best they could so as to pass it off as a serious drama  if you spend two hours on this film they are two hours you will never get back and two hours wasted that you will regret for the rest of your life,negative,0
how important is the director anyway in this film made in the politically tumultuous times of the late 60s where questions of social organization were prime conflicts asks that question by making a movie that turns the camera away from the action and only begs to reveal the director william greaves it is an important work as it shows like no other movie shows the difficulties in blocking organizing and setting the scene it reveals the role of the crew something most directors frankly would like to disappear completely and that the invisibility of is essential for suspending disbelief and it also puts into consideration the role of performance and scripting and how they matchdont match reality and what that has to say about how the director ultimately influences reality if at all  the documentary or pseudodocumentary or fictional narrative whichever you prefer via your interpretations of the themes has its brain in the overeducated overintellectual crew its guts in the lost performers struggling to understand the vague and ambiguous directions and its heart in the director who stands in as the desire to portray to represent to express without any idea how to do any of those things or why he wants to do it its a film that purposefully repeats banalities just to see if they can become more than banalities its a film that sometimes shows the multiple shots simultaneously just to leave the editing to the audience and also reveal how disturbingly different shots change perspective  its an important work and something that everyone interested in the industry and process of filmmaking should watch and understand it like many experimental films has no real massaudience appealits not for them its for the industry and its for the 60s asking what to do with a groupeffort medium that still relies on a single voice and author  polarisdib,positive,1
this is a badly made poor remake of bimaldas classic parineeta the story is based on sarat chandras book of the same name and it is a distortion of the original well one can appreciate some degree of creativity but not sham creativity the acting by everyone is affected and the entire movie is a sham shekars fathers choice of words in abusing lolita  balan  sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story again the scene where shekhar  saif  slaps lolita is quite out of place with the flow of the movie and the characters is quite jarring to the senses and could have been easily avoided similarly the sex scene between saif and balan is quite unbecoming the movie and a cheap gimmick to attract the audience when a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys its spirit the work falls apart the song piyu bole is quite ok another silver lining in the dark cloud of this movie is the scene where saif stands up for himself and rebels against his father this is a positive departure from the original and deserves credit on these counts this movie deserves 3 stars the song and dance by rekha smacks of artifice and it is a put on the song is tuneful but i remember having heard it somewhere before and if iam not mistaken the tune appears to have been plagiarized   well agreed the times have changed from then to now but then this movie is not even reflective of the modern times  this is what happens when the modern bollywood film makers get increasingly obsessed with impressing the nris and grabbing the lucrative nri entertainment market such movies end up neither belonging to india nor to any other part of the world,negative,0
i really liked this movie it totally reminds me of my high school days the soundtrack is awesome i am a huge nic cage fan and this is my favorite movie that he is in i love the storyline it is a total love story against the odds kind of thing i think anyone who graduated in the early eighties 19801984 should see the movie it totally brought back memories of high school for me,positive,1
gojoe takes a little getting used to at first but the final result is very satisfying the tale about a murderous samurai who seeks to redeem himself by opposing an effeminate but dangerous samurai is worth more than a watch there is a lot at stake here from physical survival to soulful salvation the movie may seem a bit similar to other animeinspired samurai film at first but it does eventually delve into more matureadult territory soon after  not to be missed gojoe is one of the better samurai movies to come around postkurosawa  8 out of 10  go to wwwnixflixcom for a more detailed review of the movie and reviews of other foreign films,positive,1

the first thing i noticed about this movie was how well everything was set up a quality movie all round   i suppose you could love this film just for its action but i liked it for more than that  this is a pure thrillerhorror movie it offers a more fullyfleshed script than most horror films do i thought at least the us version ended brilliantly and was great throughout the story felt honest and brutal  the film has an excellent tight script that keeps the action moving with believable characters in largely believable situations,positive,1
full house came to me when i was about 9 i remember seeing reruns of americas funniest home videos with bob saget and one day my mom told me that he was also in a show called full house one day i was lucky enough to catch an episode while visiting family it didnt seem too interesting at first but as i watched more and more ever night at 900 i would just be so into it  this show really makes you want to be there yourself hang out with the girls go places with them and maybe even join in their little family singalongs  the thing i like most about full house is that its a great show for kids and adults of all ages there will be some parts that are more for adults then parts that are meant for kids so that the whole family will enjoy it no matter how cheesy it can be its still a great show and i would definitely recommend it to anyone  1010,positive,1

by 1909 dw griffith had been directing films for the biograph company for about a year and  working at a rate of two or three per week  was rapidly beginning to develop his skills as a filmmaker the sealed room is a very interesting 11 minute short a fascinating piece of gothic melodrama that even drifts slightly into the realm of early horror the simple narrative was probably inspired by edgar allen poes 1846 short story the cask of amontillado and concerns a powerful king who conceives a deliciously sadistic form of revenge to punish his wifes infidelity  set in medieval times the sealed room begins with the king arthur v johnson overseeing the construction of a windowless room from a sequestered dovecote the idea being that he and his wife marion leonard will have a completely private place to enjoy each others company he is obviously very much in love with her always showing his affection this latest act the crowning achievement of his endearment however unbeknownst to the king his wife has fallen in love with the royal minstrel henry b walthall during one romantic liaison inside the speciallybuilt room the wife and the minstrel are discovered and the heartbroken king conceives a means of getting his retribution on the ignorant couple silently he orders his workmen to seal off the only doorway with stone and mortar slowly descending into cackling insanity as each new stone is placed down  dw griffith always had an eye for acute detail and the sealed room is an excellent early example of this the lavish medieval century costumes lend the film a sense of reality and the castle interior looks authentic enough to be believable at the time the director was also pioneering methods of creating suspense and i must admit that as the film progressed i became fixated on finding out what would happen to the hapless young lovers in the early minutes griffith restricts his shots to lengthy longtakes from a stationary camera as was usual at the time but soon  parallel to the progressively darker subject matter  he alters his editing tactics in a fascinating way though he may not have invented the technique griffith was crucial in popularising the use of crosscutting  that is alternating between different events occurring at the same time not only does this create a sense of continuity but it also maximises the level of suspense since we as the audience are well aware not only of the kings ghastly actions but also that the wife and the minstrel are oblivious to it all  despite these innovations the sealed room suffers from many of the shortcomings typical of the era the entire film takes place in just two rooms with footage captured from a total of just three positions and so it is prone to become dull and monotonous at times the acting performances are greatly exaggerated for extra effect however at least in the case of arthur v johnson his overplaying actually contributed to recognising the escalating madness of the betrayed king a moment that i thought particularly effective was when the two lovers attempted to exit the room only to find their only doorway replaced with a wall of solid stone their panicked reactions accompanied by the silent maniacal cackling of the king serve very well to create an impending sense of claustrophobia i did think however that their supply of oxygen was exhausted surprisingly quickly,positive,1
hanabi has many quiet moments and fairly slow pacing unfortunately during the many thoughtful interludes the viewer is left to ponder about the recent scenes just watched and many questions surface and annoy  for example why didnt the wheelchair guy drown in the ocean when he was stuck in the sand and the tide came up around him there was no rescue seen or hinted at  can it be true that japanese police are so inept and unskilled at arrest procedures as to not first remove the suspects ability to reach for a weapon these detectivelevel japanese police seemed to have no experience dealing with a suspect  why doesnt the right eye of the lead character blink having one eye blinking was distracting and it went unexplained  what exactly was the lead character spending all his money on to have to borrow so much from loan sharks he was not seen gambling being a non entrylevel government employee his wife must have had full health insurance  what was the single man doing all by himself in the middle of nowhere in the nature park what was his reason for being there  how in the world could the gangsters find the lead character and his wife up in the far off nature reserve it made no sense  and again how could the gangsters later find the lead character and his wife up in the remote mt fuji resort there were absolutely no clues available for these gangsters to even know which country the lead character and his wife were in let alone the correct specific location at the correct specific time  and a third same question how could the junior detectives know which few feet of the japanese coast line to find the lead character and his wife the japanese coast line must be vast were all of these characters supposed to have psychic powers  two final questions the cute girl trying to fly a kite on the beach  where did she come from she seemed to have no transportation or companions with her and why in the world did she still keep attempting to fly what was left of her kite after it was ripped in pieces this was weird unintentionally pythonesque  on the positive side i loved the background music it was dramatic and flowing and added much to this movie the photography imagery and art were pleasing to the eye  one final point the wife was overly pleasing to the eye not once did she ever come close to looking like a dying sick person she looked very healthy if anything these people seemed depressed and mentally ill and not physically sick the husband treated his wife as perhaps a newly outed gay man would treat a respected wife a love of friendship but not close tenderness  a mixed movie for sure,negative,0
okso by minute 15 in the film theres still no dialogue  this film arrived to me in a padded sack from down under with sharpie encrypted info on the front i am a programmer from a north american fest and mod love was sent thru to me by our chief as a potential starter having preemd at the faraway moscowkarlovy vary interface  straight away i thought this film is not for us no dialogue by minute 15 but kept watching anyway well well well it built and built and built and half way in i was involved in this film because like when you go to the zoo at first youre reticent but by the time you get to the dangerous snakes bit youre totally there  this film has a dangerousness not at all like the much hyped wolf creek but because it is so totally other in every way shape and form and seems to weave a web made up of all the fantasies of most independent firsttime helmers ie  gloomy weather redneck intrigue odd splicing eerie music and a plot which though imperfect and basic has a bit in common with one of the great aussie movies ie the cars that ate paris by wier but modern love is actually not really a very aussie movie in the sense of ockerishness and playful selfdeprecation that pervades many of that countrys films it works on a more nightmarish realm from the start no cellphones no brand names no ipods no gritty urban middleclass angst  just a dude married to a goodlooker an old volvo and a little boy son who has weird teeth and chucks stuff around oh and its set in weird seaside village where people all look slightly wrong photographed by nick matthews 237 and music by tom huzenroeder ten canoes mod luv succeeds where many aust movies fail  ie it stands up without regard to the godforsaken country that it comes out of instead it revels in a warped but entertaining riddle which the film itself cannot solve  and herein lies the weak linkwhat on earth does this film have to do with modern love the final minutes of the film seem to give an answer or at least hints at oneand as i sat and drank a coffee and ate my hersheys afterwards all that i could surmise was that this films helmer alex frayne will prob have a lot of fun with this one,positive,1
this odd little film starts out with the story of bruno alex linz in a catholic school who has no friends and gets beat up everyday he likes to wear dresses and his obese mother angela who is a dressmaker doesnt think their is anything wrong with what her son likes angela complains to mother superior kathy bates but gets ignored and as the two of them walk back to theyre car they are harassed by the other kids and are pelted with eggs brunos father dino gary sinise is divorced from angela and is totally disgusted by his son being a sissy and practically disowns him bruno meets a new student at school named shawniqua kiami davael who is a free spirit and dresses like annie oakley with cap pistols angela has a heart attack and brunos grandmother steps in to take care of him when dino refuses  the film starts out with a very hard and unsympathetic look at all the characters involved angela has a great deal to do with bruno wearing dresses as she practically encourages him dino was told when he was a young boy by his mother that he was a sissy because he liked opera and now he refuses to help bruno when he needs it the catholic school that bruno attends is very unruly and all the kids run rampant and even call shawniqua the n word once shirley maclaine steps in the film shifts and becomes more family oriented so to speak spoiler alert the ending after the spelling bee is incredibly contrived and feel good hugs and cheers for bruno as reporters follow him and take his picture for their papers all the while shirley maclaine is acting like the tough old broad who snaps at everyone there is one thing about maclaines character in the film that no one has mention in these comments and it has to do with the masculine nature of her i think the character of helen might be a lesbian shes very tough and strong and at one point in the film she shares a shot of whiskey with bruno and smokes a cigar at the same time i dont remember anyone in the film mentioning who her husband was or if she was ever married at all this is why i think her character might be gay lots of other good actors appear in the film as well joey lauren adams jennifer tilly brett butler gwen verdon and lainie kazan all should have taken a better look at the script before they signed on i guess when they heard that maclaine was directing that it would be an honor to be part of it very difficult to feel any remorse or understanding towards any of the characters and the subject matter is probably impossible for most to relate to the actors are not bad but what exactly was maclaine aiming for tolerance towards a young boy who wants to wear dresses and freedom of expression we get that in the first 10 minutes the rest of the time i was trying not to cringe,negative,0
this is yet another tellitasitis madhur bhandarkar film i am not sure why he has this obsession to show child molesion and gy concepts to the indian filmy audience but i find some of those scenes really disgusting whats new it is a nice piece put together by bhandarkar where he shows the story of an entertainment reporter played by leading lady in the famous film mr  mrs iyer what makes this movie different is that it also covers the stories of people that this reporter interacts with or is friends with such as her roomies her colleagues film stars models rich people and others featured in the entertainment page3 in her newspaper  noticeable it is another good performance from mrs iyer she is likely to be noticed for this role she does selective roles but shines in them she is noticeably deglamorized and less beautiful in this film but then entertainment reporters are not supposed to outshine the people they cover right verdict madhur has come up with another good movie that brings social issues to the limelight very nicely however this movie loses focus and one is not sure what the director is trying to convey  is he trying to show us the glitz and glamor of the rich people or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and contrasting that with the life of the real crime reporter is he trying to tell us how the government and rich folks rule the press or is he trying to illustrate the issues with child abuse and gy folk the other concepts brought forth include the unwritten rule that young women have to sleep with directors or costars if they wish to enter bollywood  in addition he talks about how flight assistants get sick and tired of their jobs after a while and resort to extreme measures by marrying much elder people etc he also talks about unhappy women and spoilt kids in rich families  this was all okay for me but might be too complex for an average moviegoer who just wants to relieve some stress from day to day work,positive,1
i actually went to see this film in a theater but what a complete waste of time and money bad acting im sorry to say did not help to enjoy this rather sticky screenplay  some friends told me to go and see this film since james redfield the author of the book was very heavily involved in the screenplay they had really enjoyed the book so the movie just had to be perfect well maybe i had my hopes up a bit too high but i absolutely hated this movie it was predictable too sweetish to a point that i actually left i had to vomit and worst of all there is going to be a sequel do the world a favor and stop this abominable crusade,negative,0
the dead spots and picturepostcard superficiality of out of africa just about buried any interest i might have had to read isak dinesen so when my brother bought me babettes feast and knowing it was based on a dinesen story i didnt exactly race to the vcr but as the titles rolled it became clear that this was no ordinary movie jutland where its set is not africa the chill mist that collects on the camera shots is not inviting the cold forbidding sea the heavy gray clouds the pale icy green cliffstranslate to hardships that show on the faces over which director gabriel axel draws the curtain the craggiest is bodil kjers as philippa amid the myriad merits of this movie the most memorable is that face it stands like a map laying before us the cherished wonder of her minister fathers apostolate like a maze of longoverlooked fjords where the complications of her congregations perseverance and commitment hang like gleaming escutcheons  i gather its dinesens point how the world is drawn inexplicably to christian dedication when philippa is rejected by her only serious suitor because he fears hell never measure up to the rules and rigors of her small religious clique and he returns to find her mistress of whom he regards as the greatest chef on the continent i figure its also her point that christ answers the doubts and regrets of those who give up worldly success philippas sister martina rebuffs efforts by a visiting baritone jeanphilippe lafont whose jolliness creates an uplifting counterpoint to the sparsity of spirit that surrounds his discovery to turn her into an opera star the title character leaves france and an enviable reputation and seeks sanctuary as the servant of two spinster sisters to pursue artistic triumphs for only god and those closest to him to witness but its axel who weaves the asperity of these peoples lives with the richness of martinas voice and babette hersants table and effects a sumptuousness youd never expect from a movie about sacrifice faith and religious conviction  what sets this movie apart from other religious movies is its sly humor babettes feast that is the banquet itselfa posthumous commemoration of the ministers 100th birthdayis a beautifully orchestrated clash of sensibilities that delivers comic moments by an ensemble of actors that are unparalleled in their subtlety its just this deft comedy that enriches the solemn sentiments at closing together they do something pious movies seldom do they leave a believer tremulously hopeful and unexpectedly resolute and humbled,positive,1
from the critical acclaim i expected more from this movie and from tamara jenkins the story just meandered along and didnt seem to have a point or a plot and i find it hard to believe that a 14 year old girl mature for her age or no would be so blase about getting the loss of her virginity over with maybe i am too young to relate i was four years old in 1976 but i didnt have any problems connecting with the stories of shakespeare in love or life is beautiful and i wasnt alive for either of those settings the cast is very good but unfortunately for them the script did not alow them to engage the audience overall slums had its moments but unless you are yearning to reminisce over halter tops and tube socks i would say skip this one,negative,0
some spoilers  theres nothing in this movie that you havent already seen browsing the net nothing is shocking about this film in the film a man sodomizes a goat theres a bulldozer decapitation and a lesbians face gets burnt off all of these scenes of extreme violence are so fake it makes one wonder why anyone would even want to resurface this piece of trash i simply cannot believe i spent hard earned money on what certainly has to be the worst film ever made dont let reviews fool you this film would be a shame for anyone to ownexcept maybe prisons who want to torture inmates for a real exploitation classic look to bloodsucking freaks or even the more recent doom generation island of death sinks to the bottom of the movie toilet and needs to be flushed out of existence,negative,0
 and i do mean it if not literally after all i have not seen every movie ever created at least obviously among the ones the many i know  53  the rule of thumb with imdb is this sometimes movies rated very highly for example the piece of kanneskompetitionkrownedkoreankraap called oldboy can be truly bad but rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under 6 this movie very much worth watching is a disgrace  true i give it a 10 in protest the movie is not perfect its true rating should be an 8 or a 9 it has some acting flaws belafonte especially the script wanders around sometimes however what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times the czech jan kadar directing two of the greatest actors of all time the beloved largerthanlife zero mostel and the sublime ida kaminska in an actingpoeticmoral tour de force a pair made in heaven its true that this movie little flaws apart does not pander to the average audiences but those interested in watching an excellent while again not beyond criticism movie of the incomparable director who gave us the shop on the main street the best movie ever about holocaust should not miss this just because some silly imdb rating system decides that american beauty is better than the angel levine  it isnt,positive,1
spending an hour seeing this brilliant dan finnerty and his dan band perform their special on bravo is the most enjoyable hour ive ever spent watching tv this young man dan is such an incredible talent as a singer performer and even dancer he can go from the cheesiest of ballad pop songs all of which have only been sung by women to hiphop rock also songs written for women this guy can do anything ive seen him live at least 11 times so i was not expecting just how well that his show would adapt to a television or film format but all reservations went away instantly when the show started because of dans overwhelming star qualitydo yourself a favor and watch this or better yet buy it,positive,1
late film critic gene siskel said that this movie shows how easy it is to make a movie he was giving it a compliment even though now that might have been taken as an insult these days even though i didnt always agree with gene siskel i agree with him here love jones is a shining example of how a love story should be realistic with real characters in real situations  the story chronicles the ups and downs of the relationship between darius lovehalllarenz tate and ninania long larenz tate and nia long are more than just a beautiful couple on screen these two actually have chemistry together you can feel the vibe between these two whenever the are on screen and its fantastic  bill bellamy is pretty funny as the deceitful wood and lisa nicole carson is great as ninas friend simone isaiah washington is just as great as dariuss close friend savon and i sigh every time i see him in a movie the guy is a great actor whose career is ruined by industry lowlifes and the childish games they play you can believe that he called the little weasel on greys anatomy out of his name but anybody that knows how follywood works knows better than to believe any official story from the place of make believe at any rate  love jones is a wonderful love story full of interesting and likable characters that are in realistic situations that anybody that has been in love can relate too you love these people because they are believable and are not portrayed as gangsters and tramps not one obscene stereotype can be found here contrast that with the romance movies of toady exactly in closing if you love black cinema then you would do well to own a copy of this movie,positive,1
this movies origins are a mystery to me as i only know as much as imdb did before i rented it i assume that before starship troopers killshot was one of the countless unaired pilots that never made it to network cable or otherwise the new title of kill shot is comically thrown into the opening sequence the first of many quick clues that this was not ever intended for the cinema the quick cuts cheesy melrose place music and short 2second closeup candid shots of the main actors let you know what youre in for  and i dont mind at all i rented this movie seeing the repackaging that puts casper van dien and denise richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net thinking it would be funny to see them in a movie besides the scifi travesty of starship troopers an excellent book in my opinion not so hot a movie  but thats another review after looking it up on imdb my roommate and i surmised that the pilot was dragged up after the apparent success of troopers and richards own career see bondgirl and wild things references here they threw in a sex scene involving a minor character to reach the coveted rrated status  coveted in suspense video rental sections that is in any event they should have left it unrated if youre trying to sell it in the suspensesoftcore porn section  all in all its entertaining i hate to spoil the fun of telling you its a tv pilot though that was the biggest pull while watching it  when you expect a cinematic movie and get a tv show the differences between them make themselves more clear than usual  would i rent it again no would i watch this tv show well why not  its better than baywatch and their meager attempts at hitting all demographics would have done well back in the mid 90s token black guy whos gay to avoid the tv taboo of interracial dating token asian japanese i assume from the name koji more adept at science and computers than talking to women beautiful intelligent latina premed student who has everything going for her except her familys bank account  this show probably would have done ok  but as a movie it just cracks me  i gave it a 7 out of 10 considering what it was and what it was forced to become it made for a very enjoyable evening and thats all i ask of rentals,positive,1
another pretentious film from vicente aranda if juana la loca shinned of the same at least its quality was superior mainly thanks to the great performance of pilar lópez de ayala but carmen is boring and full of topics ardent brunette with a dagger in the stocking poor man dragged to madness due to passion sierra nevada gangs toreros  obviously paz vega is a pretty woman but about its talent therere more doubts and sbaraglia role is so stupid that results almost incredible the script is weak and and arandas presumptuous character influences the entire film with these ingredients the result could not be good  not the worst film ive seen but a complete failure in my opinion,negative,0
the concept for this movie was quite good but somehow the execution failed on many parts there arent many horror movies that i can think of that used dolls that looked so realistic especially when these dolls start blinking their eyes or moving hands so much could have been done with this premise there were a lot of scenes where there was room for tension and suspense and i really was expecting creepy things to happen but never did the movie managed to be scary one of the main reasons is that the story is too minimal and predictable i actually thought that they did this on purpose in order to surprise us with some wonderful twist sadly this doesnt happen well at least not in the way that i hoped for the cast also failed to make it all believable it would have been nice if more background was given on the characters in the beginning when we get introduced to the main character it seems that she and other characters are invited by some sort of artist but it also is apparent that they dont have an idea themselves what they are invited for of course this is part of the mystery but it does seem unlikely if i got an invitation without having a clue what the deal is i simply would not go furthermore most characters arent real likable with the end result that you never actually care for them another flaw is that the director deviates from the basic premise which is scary enough and brings up new elements that never get explained and arent even relevant to the doll master mystery overall this movie has been a big disappointment to me if you want to see a good horror movie involving dolls go see dead silence,negative,0
the luzhin defence is in the foreground a story of an idiosyncratic chess savant turturro who becomes consumed by the game and in the background via flashbacks his boyhood life and the forces which created the man he has become factor in good and evil in the forms of his his love interest watson and former mentor wilson respectively and you have a plaintive drama laced with poignant and delicately humorous moments mingled with the rich scenic beauty of italys lake como and the intensity of high chess play an excellent film for those into period dramas the auteurs euphemistic chess play metaphor for orgasmic delight is an indication of the subtle wit behind the film,positive,1
this film is so bad  dialogues story actors and actresses  everything  that its hard to imagine that well see a worse movie this year or in the following years loves brother set in australia among italian immigrants has nothing but shallow clichés about italian culture to offer and it is quite telling that even the italians from and in italy speak english in the film the message of the film  ugly people have to marry ugly people beautiful people have to marry beautiful people  is truly discomforting giovanni ribisi is quite good in films like suburbia or lost in translation but here his pseudoitalian accent is hard to bear see this film at your own risk trash as trash can,negative,0
savage guns video title is a dirt cheap bottom of the barrel spaghetti western in which the survivor of a massacre hunts the bandits who killed his brother and left him for dead catching up with them in a town controlled by their crooked boss  despite plenty of violence this manages to be both dull and colorless with bad characterizations and almost no imagination or humor  lead actor robert woods lives up to his name with a wooden and uncharismatic performance that fails to generate any warmth or sympathy whatsoever in other words the viewer never really roots for him despite the fact that hes the protagonist  the worst scene in my opinion is the annoying dance hall scene where a woman sings in a heavy and terribly unsexy german accent it was the worst scene in blazing saddles and the worst one here,negative,0
this movie is just bad bad bad bad now that ive gotten that out of the way i feel better this movie is poor from beginning to end the story is lame the 3d segment is really bad freddy is at his cartoon character worst thank god they killed him off and who wants to see roseanne and tom arnold cameos  the only good thing in the movie is the little bit of backstory that were given on freddy we see he once had a family and we get to see his abusive alcoholic father alice cooper  other than that all bad there are some quality actors in here lisa zane and yaphet kotto and they do their best but the end result is just so bad the hour and a half i spent watching this movie is and hour and half i cant ever get back,negative,0
sunshine is a european import set in hungary between 1880 and 1980 its the epic story of hungarian jews the sonnenschein family this name literally translates to sunshine the family has humble beginnings then is prosperous becomes upwardly mobile changes its name and hopes to assimilate into hungarian society so successive generations can advance professionally the story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of three generations ralph fiennes plays these three roles for those who missed the wwii and the holocaust in europe the sonnenschein approach to life doesnt work out very well  sunshine is being acclaimed as an artistic success but it is an opportunity missed the story line dominated by world history is predictable and transparent this is reinforced with voice cover narration and newsreel footage the family plot lurches from one predictable event ie the hapsburgs wwi wwii fascism communism etc to the next with little continuity depth or detail the jewish assimilation theme is unfocused and important subthemes the secret diary and family philosophy that could have given the family character and credibility are l ost until the very end alternatively the filmmakers provide generation continuity using common themes of incest  infidelity  ralph fiennes exhibits flashes of brilliance but his performance is far from award winning material the 3 for 1 casting format is a viewer distraction and feels more like a cheap cinema gimmick than good theater sunshine is basically hungarian history channel material it has the look and feel of winds of war morphed with forrest gump morphed with something about sex  ,negative,0
empire of passion starts out deceptively  that is if youre immediately expecting it to be a horror movie its like a riff on james m cains the postman always rings twice at first seki kazuko yoshiyuki is a mother of two and a dutiful hardworking wife to rickshaw driver gisaburo takahiro tamura but when hes not around and shes at home with the baby the feisty and aimless young man toyoji tatsuya fuji comes around to bring some goodies for seki and a little extra theyre soon sleeping together but after he does something to her lets just say a shave he knows that hell find out and immediately proposes that they kill gisaburo they drink him up strangle him and then toss him down a well naturally this will come back to haunt them  but that its literally at least to them at first superterrified seki and then only later on skeptical toyoji changes gears into the kaidan a japanese ghost story  this is a film where the horror comes not simply out of oh ghost ah but out of the total dread that builds for the characters in a way theres the mechanics of a filmnoir at work throughout if only loosely translated by way of a 19th century japanese village as opposed to an american city or small town ie the snooping cop the evidence found possibly by another word getting around suspicions aroused etc its compelling because seiko actually was against the plan from the start manipulated by the lustful but illprepared toyoji and her reactions to gisaburos reappearances are staggering to her take the one that comes closest to poetry gisaburos ghost paleblue face and mostly silent chilling stare motions for seiko to get on the rickshaw she does reluctantly and he pushes her around on a road she doesnt know in the wee hours before dawn surrounded by smoke most japanese ghost stories wish to heavens they could get this harrowingly atmospheric  while it starts to veer into hysterics towards the end theres so much here that director oshima gets right in making this a distinctive work after hitting it huge in the international cinema world with in the realm of the senses which ironically got banned in his own country he made something that he claimed was even more daring that senses maybe he was right empire of passion has less graphic sexual content by far than its predecessor also starring tatsuya fuji a magnificently physical actor with an immense lot of range but its daring lies in crafting a world of dread you can believe in ghosts in this story but you also have to believe how far down to their own personal hells these two wouldbe lovebirds will go the snooping detective or the gossiping townspeople are the least of their worries the fate of their very souls is at stake  and oshima takes what in other hands could be merely juicy pulp sadly it wouldnt surprise me if an american remake was already in the works and crafts shot after gorgeous shot with repetition working its way into the misenscene ie the shots of seiko and toyoji walking on that road the camera at a dutch angle the world tilted and surrounding them in a grim blue hue as well as some affecting movements that will stay with me long after i finish typing this ie toyoji throwing the leaves by one hand into the well in slow motion or how seikos nude body is revealed after she becomes blind its daring lies in connecting on a level of the spirit not to be confused with the spiritual though there may be something with that as well about life and deaths connections to one another inextricably its a classic waiting to be discovered,positive,1

when i got this movie free from my job along with three other similar movies i watched then with very low expectations now this movie isnt bad per se you get what you pay for it is a tale of love betrayal lies sex scandal everything you want in a movie definitely not a hollywood blockbuster but for cheap thrills it is not that bad i would probably never watch this movie again in a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time or you would see it on a sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time despite the bad acting cliché lines and sub par camera work i didnt have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my dvd player the story has been done many times in many movies this one is no different no better no worse   just your average movie,negative,0
can anybody tell me where is the comedy    charlie sheen is a very weak comedian thomas haden church is looking so feeble with him  and the whole thing is so thickheaded    they tried to make a live comic book which turned out to be super bloody comic nightmare and it wasnt even funny like the plans scene in the bathroom it was so good with its cinematic imagination but there is nothing more except pain    donald sutherland  his relationship with his daughter   this is actually a kind of work which they made it just to made it and earn some money from it  but it became such a crime when this money would be robbed from the very us whom got deceived by so low art work and an entertainment had absolutely no entertainment at all   well it wouldve been uglier if it was big production and starring brando in his golden years with a real star  the sheens family in here just be aware of that   anyone who found themselves admiring this movie or god forbid loving it  then you must go directly to therapy before you become more dangerous and hurt anybody else   brando undoubtedly is a genius but the movie isnt  and he wasnt intending to be one in here after reading this for sure  but the main big problem is that no one else ever worked in this thing trying or wanting to be a small time smart or even good  sorry im crying now  the movies torturing is unbelievable    there is a scene where brando hitting mira sorvino by her shoes  that was so realistic  maybe he was seeing himself in her so he was punishing himself for being in such a crap    for the milliard time  this one couldve been better or less worse  the script till the trains heist was nice and i just imagined that theyd escape to have some chase like its another smokey and the bandit but with brando as the sheriff in fact any of those chimeras was much merciful than what ive watched   why this masterpiece didnt receive any razzie award  you want to make me believe that there was lower movie than this  i do not think so  its a situation where the razzies supervisor must himself win one for his negligence   martin sheen is here also as a guest star maybe for supporting his failure son but ironically the father was as failure as his son  and why is that  well  because i hate martin sheen maybe more than i hate comic movies werent as good as its ambition    its not a comedy movie no its a horror one  and i just hate horror movies especially those which have been propagandized as comic ones    name good thing about it hmmm  well this one compared to another marlon brandos monster movie the island of dr moreau  1996 would be close to casablanca    ps  if you still want to know what are or who are precisely the bad the ugly and the very ugly in this movie just pray your last prayers and go watch it may god help you ,negative,0
this period melodrama is one of griffiths earliest claustrophobic films characters trapped within a room are prevalent throughout his work and as time went by he would become increasingly adept at portraying their helplessness and involving the audience in their terror in the bluntly titled sealed room there is one major difference to the normal plot line in that there truly is no escape  griffith achieves the claustrophobic effect here in two ways first is his use of space while the typical biograph short might utilise a dozen or more sets the sealed room features only two adjoining rooms  the kings court and the dove cote that becomes the eponymous tomb the set design in these shorts is rarely referenced but here it is crucial the court is a large interior with a backdrop hinting at greater depth and showing us a window and a staircase actors enter and leave from various directions suggesting the room is not only spacious but also free and open by contrast the dove cotes back wall is very close to the camera and the angles in it suggesting a hexagonal or octagonal shape make it seem even more confined  the second technique on display here is the crosscutting anyone with an interest in griffiths work will probably know about his heavy use and development of crosscutting to build excitement or tension many will also know that strictly speaking it wasnt his invention however what makes griffiths crosscuts so effective is the way he paces the opposing images so they complement each other the sealed room contains a good example of what i mean the shots of the masons shifting the heavy bricks have a slow stepbystep pace to them with tension building as the wall gets higher this movement is matched by the shots of the blissfully unaware lovers in which marion leonard tears off flower petals onebyone as the couple realise their predicament their rising panic is complemented by the opposing shot of the king madly thrashing his sword against the wall  at this point griffith was yet to realise that the action could be heightened further by introducing a third strand to the crosscut the dramatic ridetotherescue here absent was later to become a standard climax to griffiths pictures,positive,1

deliverance is one of the best exploitation films to come out of that wonderful 1970s decade from whence so many other exploitation films came  a group of friends sets out on a canoe trip down a river in the south and they become victimized by a bunch of toothless hillbillies who pretty much try to ruin their lives its awesome  we are treated to anal rape vicious beatings bow and arrow killings shootings broken bones etc a lot like 1974s texas chainsaw massacre to say that deliverance is believable would be immature this would never and could never happen even in the dark ages of 1972  deliverance is a very entertaining ride and packed full of action it is one in a huge pile of exploitation films to come from the early 70s and it arguably sits on top of that pile with its great acting superb cinematography and excellent writing  8 out of 10 kids,positive,1
love jones is one of the best movies ive experienced   the main element that sticks out to me is the fact that it is very welldirected i have studied this film in its entirety  with watching movies more than once certain things dawn on you subconsciously  the direction of this movie as well as the writing is chic hip and artful i am in love with the direction the scene where larenz tate and nia long are riding the motorcycle through north chicago at night is astonishing the director of this movie deserved awards for his great job  love jones is a classy and sexy film it highlights the fact that we can be people who love who have flaws who love living learning and just being us without the hype being our natural selves  the poetry is wonderful but the story line the dialog and the scenes really make this movie  this movie deserves to be seen it is a great movie for lovers and friends to sit back and watch or the hopeless romantic like myself to sit back and enjoy alone on a friday or saturday night any day of the week where peace solitude and a little entertainment is needed love jones is what i recommend,positive,1

nicodemus is almost a copy of red in the odd behavior sense but this episode focuses on other people in clark kents unpredictable life when a poisonous flower finds its way into smallville jonathan kent is the first to be effected by it the flower causes people to reverse their behavior and when it effects jonathan he becomes short tempered and violent however clark manages to stop him from doing anything rash until his father finally passes out okay so far so good next up is lana the episode was good up to that point for the flower causes her to attempt seducing clark at the last moment he refuses her but the damage has already been done this episode causes the wrong impressions and isnt suitable for people under the age of twenty due to its adult content the first part was good the last part focusing on the effect the flower has on pete was good but the middle that was all about lanas alternate personality was most defiantly not and that ruined what could have been a brilliant episode i give this episode two,negative,0

in 1983 two bond movies was made one was the official bond movie octopussy starring roger moore who starred as james bond for the first time in live and let die and the other was the unofficial bond movie never say never again starring sean connery who played the role as james bond for the first time in dr no that film was also the first 007 james bond movie to be made never say never again is called unofficial because the company that made the other james bond movies didnt make this one never say never again is also a remake of the 1965 007 movie thunderball there are several differences in never say never again that lets you know it wasnt made by eon one thing is that the opening is different theres no gun barrel sequence and no precredit sequence another difference is the music score some things in this movie does feel like a james bond movie like the gadgets and cars plus james bond always getting it on with the ladies and the film does have an opening credits song sean connery still does a great job playing bond the acting from the other stars is also great   never say never again is a good film thats just has entertaining as the official james bond films check this out 1010,positive,1
this academy award winning short film can rank among the greatest of the genre told completely without dialogue it is a visual treat about a young boy who buys a gold fish lovingly places him in a bowl then goes off to school leaving the gold fish unprotected and a window carelessly open after a while a neighboring orange tabby comes poking around comes in through the window and heads slowly for the bowl the fish apparently knows something is going on and becomes very excited as the cat comes very near to the bowl the fish jumps out the cat catches the fish drops him back in the bowl and exits through the window he came in just as the boy not knowing what has happened gets back this was amazingly filmed with real animals how cousteau got these animals to behave in this manner is remarkable i only wish this film were available now for people to see i only saw it once in 1959 when it was originally released but it has remained unforgettable,positive,1
i do not know who is to blame miss leigh or her director but her performance as catherine is almost impossible to watch ben chaplin on the other hand does a superior job  against all odds as far as i am concerned his character is entirely too charming and appealing but certainly not shown as greedy enough to put up with leighs characters silliness chaplin appears bemused by what cannot possibly be understood as leighs shyness and lack of grace but rather her orthopedic unsteadiness there has to be some element of believability to his interest but as played it is incomprehensible the performances do not jibe maggie smith and albert finney are of course wonderful despite any effort to derail them the supporting cast is also a pleasure to watch what a pity too the leads dont work together because the production is lovely to look at,negative,0
this is the only movie i have ever walked out on bad acting bad plot bad casting bad directing bad cinematography if they had set out to make a bad picture they couldnt have done a better job i hope they are proud of his turkey im surprised anyone associated with this film was ever hired again in hollywood dont waste your time,negative,0
when i saw that icon was on tv i was surprised i know that the first clue of where it was headed was the fact that it was on the hallmark channel  has to be said  sorry i was hopeful when i saw that ff himself was the exec producer but very quickly saw that the only real way that the tv movie and the book were similar were in the name and the character names only the tv plot was a hohum to say the least but i concur that in and of itself the action was worth a 3 stars in my personal opinion mr swayze could have portrayed a valid monk however i think that in order to do the movie justice it would have been a far longer movie and i dont think hollywood itself would have gone for the plot of discreditation by subterfuge a case in point is the terrible film version of the sum of all fears  need i say more,negative,0
at a panel discussion that i attended after viewing this film the filmmakers stated that one should look at this not as a movie but a provoker of thought well the only thoughts that were provoked from me were of the time wasted watching the movie the gimmicks of the film documentary style futuristic setting served as distractions of what was supposed to be a thoughtful examination of the abortion debate this film illustrates the problem when people try to use film as a platform for their political views  usually a very boring movie that preaches to the choir,negative,0
this was an excellent idea and the scenery was beautiful but thats where it ends it seemed like a lackluster set it off meets the west the plot barely made any sense there were so many characters and not enough time to develop their personalities there were too may unnecessary things going on that didnt pertain to the plot nor did it help further the story along there were also long blank moments where the plot could have been explored but was used for silence or unnecessary conversations the script should have made more sense as well as the directing i had a huge question mark on my head watching this movie but the casting was great in my opinion if youre only watching for eye candy then this is the movie for you,negative,0
ive almost forever been against the inclusion of songs in a movie my belief was that the quality of the film would automatically be improved if only those extremely annoying songs would be axed however things have quickly changed after watching that horrible black no songs  this movie page 3 plenty of songs while black was weak to an extreme page 3 delivers a gripping story with some strong acting  good direction the songs were almost incidental  blended in almost seamlessly with the film there certainly werent any women getting sprayed with water for no apparent reason from mysterious water sources while gyrating wildly on the streets at night  i was pleasantly surprised with the bold and unabashed approach used by the director there was no glossing over of anything and almost every scene was completely believable  id recommend this films for hindispeaking people with at least a slight understanding of mumbai life the former because the english subtitling was below par and contained many errors which at times completely reversed the meaning of the actual statement the latter because youll definitely appreciate the accuracy of the depiction once youve lived it yourself  id definitely rank this as a work worthy of international recognition the scenes with the gossiping drivers was a nice touch and it served simultaneously as a source of genuine humour as well as another perspective on the whole mishmash the movie does fall short in a few places though where the characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things which detract from the overall direction of the film  i also thought that a couple of the sadder scenes were not done very well it was a touch amusing to watch rather than arouse any feelings of sadness  the whole scene tended to come across as a bit foolish these are minor issues though because the film on the whole is truly a rare treat to watch  overall its a cynical pessimistic outlook and a refreshing one at that actors not heroes  thats the key a chance to glimpse believable human beings in an extraordinary setting  everyday life a behindthescenes look at the extent of the depravity and a rare ray of hope for indian cinema  810,negative,0
let me first just say that in the past i have been a huge carlin fan i think george is one of the smartest people and best comedians on the planet what made george so great in the past was his ability to look at things in his own twisted way and give us his unique perspective on those things it wasnt always meant to be funny but you always respected his opinions because they were presented in such a clever way but you are all diseased is just a long rant he doesnt give us any unique perspective on anything he just gives us a long list of stuff that hes pod at there is no insight no cleverness just an old man complaining for one hour straight about things that we have all complained about and on top of that it wasnt even funny you are all diseased appeals to dumb people who cant handle anything more advanced than something simple and direct i dont mind anger fueled comedy but george could have done so much better i really hope that george carlins next show will live up to the quality that george has shown in the past,negative,0
i recently saw episodes 14 and now i cant wait for 5  6 to be available ive heard they are coming soon commanders log seems destined to become a cult hit among the university crowd and all others with a taste for quirky comedy its obvious that the budget was small but the care taken in crafting the script is quite evident in fact the simplicity of the show allowed me appreciate the writing and the acting more bowlsby is a master of the putdown i just wish i could remember all the best ones for later use on unsuspecting coworkers lets just say that if you dont like commanders log ill personally see to it that your undies get extra starch,positive,1
it is really a shame that imdb doesnt let you give negative votes this is the most hideously awful show ever foisted on the american public by our usuallylikable neighbors to the north the parents are a troglodyte and a neurotic hag he is as charming as a wellused fire hydrant with the same hygiene standards she is a wax museum mannequin programmed with more neuroses than the entire cast of the view the kids are nonentities if female and repulsive beyond belief if male especially the title character the boy is a serious contender for most insanely smug selfsatisfied arrogant and vain male character on disney which is saying something this show was obviously conceived as the antibrady bunch but it comes off as the antichrist and why is the photography so dark,negative,0
im going to make this short and sweet its not surprising that you had no use for this film this is a story about the power beauty and possibilities inherent in a meaningful education based on your pathetically composed comments i can see that your own education has been woefully neglected or worse completely wasted your comments are those of a truly ignorant person i would advise you to do something about this condition but in your case i feel its probably too late my hope is that you yourself dont intend to go into the teaching profession  especially in film studies because you could only do damage oh one last bit of advice in the future if you intend to write more opinion pieces you should really proofread your work it will make people take you more seriously,positive,1

what do you get if you cross the matrix with the truman show  im sure youve all seen the matrix by now the creators of the matrix say that it is anime inspired just from watching the trailer to this classic you can see where they took the plot from  the film is sort of set in 1980s japan and it really shows the costumes music and wordsin the recent english language version by ad vision are all like theyve been directly lifted from the era i believe it was made in that time also but due to certain plot points this doesnt date the film  as you probably guessed by my referencing to the matrix the world isnt real its not really the 1980s in fact its something more like the 2480s after a nuclear war the earthor biosphere primes ecosystem was destroyed the survivors were forced to escape into space where the conflict continued once the planetsor biospheres were all abandoned people began to live in megazones  cities inside of spaceships where via hypnotism techniques and truman showesque illusion they were made to believe they were back on earth in the most peaceful time in recent memory the 1980s when young shogo obtains a mysterious advanced looking motorcycle it leads him to find out more than hes supposed to know the garlanda bike which becomes a mech a weapon from the 2400s aids shogo in his escape from the pursuing military as more and more is discovered about the megazone the war comes closer to home and due to conflicts between the military and the computer the war comes to the megazone too i apologise if those points are seen as spoilers but the plot is outlined basically that way on the synopsis  emotions run high in this movie moreso than the matrix you really do believe the war is going on and shogo really does become quite scarred by what hes discovering what starts off as an uberhappy cool 80s flick becomes a tragic tale of war and unreality these characters are real people not the cardboard cutouts we saw flipping around in bullettime in the matrix there really is the sense of the suffering people can go through after being caught up in such a conspiracy and a war it may just choke you up towards the end i know it did me  animation is pretty impressive for its day and the picture quality on the advision dvd is unbelievable for its age the artwork style is beautiful and reminiscent of traditional anime very cultural be prepared for quite a lot of violence and blood theres also an erotic sex scene  the ending can be seen as a there can be no ending similar to the matrix or supposedly can be followed by the sequel which i havent yet had the pleasure of watching  i have to say that this is one of the best animes ive seen in fact one of the best movies ive seen and considered by many to be one of the greatest animes of all time  i must recommend the advision dvd as their take on the english language is incredible and does the movie justice and can be purchased with an artbox for holding the two sequels when they are released which will have the same vocal cast  all in all megazone 23 is an incredible movie and deserves to be held highly and should be an essential in any anime fans collection heck even my mother enjoyed it,positive,1
i think every critic who panned tommy boy when it was released in 1995 ought to go back and watch it and learn it is not a bad film at all every critic panned chris farley and david spades movies yes coneheads was funny but kind of had a one joke premise and black sheep i agreed with the critics is one of the worst movies ever made but tommy boy does not fall in the category of coneheads which could have been a little funnier and black sheep which is a piece of tripe it is very funny and entertaining i do agree with the critics that chris farley was no john belushi or john candy as he claimed to have idolized those guys and those guys had a genius for comedy but chris farley was very funny and i wish he were around longer to prove to critics that yes he was no john belushi or john candy but he was very funny the scenes between farley and spade as nemesis are sidesplitting hilarious and the premise is also laugh out loud hilarious it is very sad that chris farley is no longer here to make us laugh but we have movies like tommy boy to remember how truly funny he was tommy boy is one of the 1990s best comedies,positive,1
despite its lowkey release in this country and its apparent disregard in other countries the r rating in the states cant have helped  honestly just because hbc uses the cword this is actually a fine piece of work the sentimentality does occasionally threaten to choke it but its overcome by the playing of the two leads  its easy to win plaudits just because youre playing a physical or mental cripple daniel daylewis geoffrey rush dustin hoffman etc and helena bonhamcarter may not quite capture the physical degradation of mnd but her vocal stretching and ruthless emotional drive compensate entirely in fact almost all her performance is conducted through her eyes and what eyes this is an intelligent turn from an actress who is rapidly undoing her english rose reputation and emerging as a figure of some stature awards must surely follow though not alas for this fine performance  branagh one feels has never quite given his best on film except possibly hamlet and there his playing was diluted by the large cast here though he tops his other appearances playing to the hilt a selfloathing unstable ultimately lovable guy with a subtlety he hasnt always displayed and exhibiting both intelligence and depth in short we believe him just as much as we could not believe him as frankenstein as the priest in the proposition as the lawyer in the gingerbread man even as andrew in peters friends this is surely his finest performance yet  so why could he not produce the goods much earlier  as a film it looks more like a television offering and without its stars it probably wouldnt amount to very much but its been a pleasure to see this pair perform their socks off like this and i eagerly await more from them though not loves labours lost 8 out of 10 but branagh and hbc get 10 out of 10,positive,1
on one thursday evening at 1000pm my local west coast abc affiliate aired the pilot episode of northern exposure the abc network usually airs men in trees in that time slot but the program was preempted for a live sporting event  despite both shows are set in alaska and filmed on location in the pacific northwest exposure in washington state trees in vancouver bc rewatching northern exposure as well as few episodes of sex and the city reminds me how disappointed i am with the poorly conceived hybrid men in trees   anne heche can be a good actress with the right material unfortunately her role as a writer who ends up in a small town in alaska grates on my nerves perhaps because i feel that heche is miscast i am not convinced of her fishoutofwater character  i also cannot help but feel that the supporting cast fits the typical quirky stereotypes the hotlooking local the kindly bar owner the bush pilot the local police officers the dim but wellintentioned radio dj etc  the only stereotype that may have been broken was teddy bear and veteran er actor abraham benrubi as the local bartender in love with two different women considering that one of the executive producers is filmmaker james mangold his movies heavy and cop land had lead characters who were large men then i am not surprised why benrubi was cast in a nontypical role  nonetheless i can see why there are a lot of dedicated viewers who love men in trees it fits the quirky niche for television audiences i wished the show could find its own voice instead of borrowing ideas from better shows,negative,0

most people who have seen this movie thinks that it is the best movie ever made i disagree but this movie is very very good tony is a bad ass guy and knows that hes intimidating and uses it to get ahead its about him and how he goes from washing dishes to having a huge house and a office with cocaine all over the desk if you want a family movie then this isnt the way to go but if you want mobsters and vengeance and stuff like that then youll like it,positive,1
this does give away some of the plot by the way a charlie brown christmas is one of those timeless classics that teach you the value christmas and just enjoying the holiday this however does not it tries to capture the emotion of a charlie brown christmas there even is another christmas play but fails with lackluster and easy jokes charlie brown is no longer wondering about the spirit of christmas but is instead wants to buy a present for peggy jean 25 gloveswhat his sister sally is the most annoying character in the movie here is one of her jokes sally wants to write a letter to santa but doesnt know how to spell charlie for some reason he needs to be in her letter so instead decides to name him sam because she knows how to spell sam also sally plays an angel in the play with one word to day hark she instead says hockey stick har har if sally saying hark 12 times all oddly sounding exactly the same doesnt kill you nothing will peppermint patty and marcy are a large focal point but that hardly makes it better marcy is funny with her responses to patty but patty is another story she sounds like a boy which doesnt dispel the rumors and gets mad when she has to be the sheep in the play terrible baas and all apparently she is the sheep every year and is worried she will forget her lines lines she doesnt have she is so worried she mentions it twice one right after the other and gets the same response im assuming she must have short term memory loss or something lucy and linus are more welcome although linus still has annoying advice but hardly amount to much air time im sure schroeder isnt even in this one all in all it tries to be a parasite to the original but compromised the message for a few quick laughs,negative,0
another try another miss france may be doomed for not being able to produce a good horror movie i mean the least they could do was to shoot the movie in the forest of brocéliande but even the forest is fake  it was shot near paris  the subject is useless the actors are really insignificant and the text makes you wish you were deaf nothing could save it  bad to the bone i wasnt warned i want my money back,negative,0
watching kroko i would have liked to leave the cinema very much for the first time in my life i would not recommend to watch this movie flat main characters  absolutely no development eg kroko the metaphoric german problem child remains a pure metaphor without any capability of positive involvement despite several plotwise chances to do so uninspired actors nonevolving plot i guess the movie attempted an environmental survey but did not succeed camera appeared shaky rather than motivated pictures were low  contrast gray and dark  i am sure deliberately but the components did not add up to a convincing impression of the social milieu the story had certain potential though it could have made a good short story,negative,0
essentially a story of man versus nature this film has beautiful cinematography the lush jungles of ceylon and the presence of elizabeth taylor but the film really never gets going newlwed taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and later is drawn to the plantations foreman played by dana andrews the plantation is under the spell of owner peter finchs late father whose ghost casts a pall over elephant walk that becomes a major point of contention between taylor and finch the elephants are determined to reclaim their traditional path to water that was blocked when the mansion was built across their rightofway the beasts go on a rampage and provides the best moments of action in the picture taylor and andrews have some good moments as she struggles to remain a faithful wife in spite of he marital difficulties with finch,negative,0
this movie is not about entertainment or not even a movie you want to see to pass the time this movie is a genuinely a display of true love that can only come from god one cannot help but be touched deeply by looking at this movie we have several dimensions of love that contributes to the value of this movie there is the divine love of god that is beautifully portrayed gods love transcends the heart and mind and endures and is eternal there is the love in a marriage while the main character grapples with his wifes disease he realizes through gods love that he loves his wife more than he could ever imagine he knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated finally you have the love of child and parent the kids in the family come together and realize that nothing else matters except that love conquers fear dear friends love is not love unless it comes from god because god is love and love comes from god talk to someone and let them know you love them love does no good unless it is given to another i pray this movie can inspire and change the lives of everyone who sees it amen,positive,1
its getting worse the series is on a serious down fall the first two sequel were acceptable and from then on we have seen a buch of really really terrible movies robert englund gives another great performance as freddy but the rest of the cast cant act the story is alice having survived the previous installment of the nightmare series finds the deadly dreams of freddy krueger starting once again this time the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of alices unborn child his intention is to be born again into the real world the only one who can stop freddy is his dead mother but can alice free her spirit in time to save her own son check out the first three miss the next three then watch the last one,negative,0
i am a huge fan of northern exposure men in trees is a complete knockoff of northern exposure theres the cityfolk from new york stuck in a remote backwoods town marin frist  joel fleishman she immediately doesnt hit it off with a local jack slattery  maggie oconnell the town only has one pilot who is not often available ther is only one radio show and the entire show is about quirky people with sincere and odd relationships too many parallels just like northern exposure except one obvious demographic has been altered in each character im bored give me something new to think about  on the upside the writing is pretty good but if this was a school project it would certainly have earned the stamp of plagiarism   perhaps people who love this show were sheltered from the dedicated creativity and hard labors of joshua brand and john falsey,negative,0
im normally a fan of bruce willis and despite him playing the coldhearted professional killer i thought him the most appealing character here that said his character makes such a mess of his professional activity its incredible he hasnt been caught before the plot is thin to the point of being nonsensical the end was no less annoying and insulting for the fact that it could have been predicted from about 20 minutes into the movie   spoilers follow  in hollywood morality the good guys always win with a few casualties along the way and the bad guys die or are at least heading for justice by the end the breathtaking insult of the film is the way that our ira terrorist who has somehow become a cuddly touchyfeely character gets to walk off to a new life as does his former terrorist playmate who is now a loving wife and mother  whos the bigger villain the former and so far as we can tell unrepentant terrorist or the hired assassin i dont see much to choose between them  in real life or in the film  this is the poorest film ive seen this year,negative,0
being a child of the 1980s i grew up with numerous educational as well as diversionary programs or both and continue to learn so much from them now that i admire the wisdom of those who worked on them after learning that sesame street to name the best example was not solely responsible for the fact that i could read at an adult level before i could walk it only increased the level of disgust i feel not only towards the lyons corporation and its product but those who defend them too as if i had faith in those we assign to protect us or our children to begin with the fact that barney  friends still pollutes our airwaves after more than a decade later is a discredit not only to the fcc american commerce and its makers it is a discredit to all of humanity in a world where i can be harassed without recourse by the police welfare services and child protection agencies simply for being born different to those in power yet broadcasters are allowed to pump this drivel into my home uncontested you have to ask what is wrong with people  you see in a world where we are expected to behave like adults and account for ourselves what we say to our sons and daughters is of importance because it will often have consequences long after we are gone not only are our attempts to make our children more normal more alike more thinkalike potentially devastating what we end up teaching them to be normal has a big part to play too so the question becomes one of what barney is teaching our children to be normal apart from lessons such as that we are not good if we do not have good feelings or that someone will change the rules to make us happy when we come up short other shocking things we are shown on the barney show include barney molesting children the issue of child abduction and child molestation is a big one in our society and has been ever since we started trying to pretend it was not but that would qualify as one of the most inappropriate ways in which to present the topic  so far i have only mentioned the inappropriate and emotionally damaging lessons barney himself presents adding to the problem is the children shown on the show i use the word children loosely here as the range of ages shown goes as low as three years and as high as fourteen yet no difference in emotional response is shown at either extreme fourteen year olds react to barney and his proposed situations in the exact same way as five year olds experts in childhood and adolescent autism especially consider this an incredibly foul thing to expose children to adults on the autistic spectrum who faced increasing problems as their needs were not only not met but flatout ignored have a tendency to watch this and feel an urge to do the kinds of things with barney that would make fourteen year olds cry as irreverent and sick as shows targeted toward the elderchild market such as you cant do that on television were they stamp all over barney by demonstrating that not only do different ages respond to the same thing in different ways so too do different people  so in response to mdmireles1295 i have to say that i hope like hell they do not have children for every time i see a parent showing their child this drivel it gives me an overwhelming urge to report them to the police for child abuse and i speak as a man whose entire upbringing was dominated by abuse they might sing about manners loving caring or sharing but the examples they show are not only so lopsided as to be the opposite of educational they are so devoid of realism as to become dangerous as the light triton has already pointed out the kind of lessons children learn from barney are that people do not vary feelings must be suppressed at all costs and rules are entirely arbitrary when compared to the lessons that variation is what makes the world go around and even the most bitter feelings have a purpose that television taught me as a boy it still boggles the mind that the authorities have yet to step in and yank this trash off the air if a parent did to their child what barney does around the world they would face criminal charges  hence i gave barney my favourite two out of ten score that i give to all rubbish with absolutely no redeeming value in a world of adults that know how to properly respond to their children it has no place,negative,0
lucasarts have pulled yet another beauty out of a seemingly bottomless bag of great games if any further proof was required that they rule this genre of gaming then this is it before actually playing the game there was a little concern about how the writers were going to keep up the pace of gags after the first two games fears were rife that it was going to wear a bit thin  play the game and see how quickly those fears are allayed from the introductory video with guybrush in the dodgem boat  to the closing stages in the funfair the jokes just keep on coming i was a great fan of the first two games and the other lucasarts works day of the tentacle sam  max etc and this one does not fail to deliver the quality you will not be disappointed well i wasnt,positive,1
sorry to disagree with you but i found the dkc series to be quite engaging so much so that i invested in the snes system and my own copies of the games this is mind you almost ten years after the initial release of dkc 1 the graphics were groundbreaking for their time the first vector graphics games for home systems the music and characters are all memorable and the games brought myself and my girlfriend dozens of hours of entertainment true the second game was better than the first and the third was perhaps lacking the edge of the second installment but all three offered different play and i enjoy them to this day by the way im old enough to remember when there were no video games whatsoever and tvs were black and white,negative,0
if this film had been made in the 50s or 60s critics and fans alike would have praised it i myself enjoyed the film from beginning to end its not a timeless piece and has not aged well over the years but it is enjoyable to watch nonetheless as for mrs ritchies acting in the film not the best on the planet  but it adds to the films unique slapstick comedyaspirations and showcases madonnas often underrated sense of comedic timing madonna plays nikki finn an exconvict who was framed for a crime she didnt commit griffin dunne plays the hapless future groompuppet who is sent to escort her from prison to the bus station where a series of unfortunate events occurs thus creating the plot and there is one folks give the film a shot you might be pleasantly surprised at how funny it really is,positive,1
this is by far the worst nonenglish horror movie ive ever seen the acting is wooden the dialogues are simply stupid and the story is totally braindead its not even scary 2 out of 10 from me,negative,0
this tale set in wellington new zealand suburbia tawa home of the renowned tawa college is mccartens first feature  with a contemporary new zealand flavour via satellite abounds with absolutely hilarious situations which develop in the adult family context at the same time it manages to invoke intense emotions of sadness and despair  one of the most moving and humourous movies of the year  not to be missed,positive,1
from todays point of view it is quite ridiculous to rate this film 18 or x in the us the film has a sexual yet sublime erotic story to tell but the pictures are rather innocent throughout the movie you feel and see the spirit of the late 60s and early 70s in the fashion the dialogues and the typical experimental cinematography and lighting and this is exactly the part that makes it worth seeing,positive,1
a superman cartoon  a huge shipment of gold is being sent across country by train using ultramodern techniques a sophisticated gang of hooded thieves try to waylay the gold with intrepid reporter lois lane as the only passenger on board its superman to the rescue but now that its become a runaway train can even he stop the billion dollar limited  this was another in the series of excellent cartoons max fleischer produced for paramount studio they feature great animation and taut fastmoving plots meant to be shown in movie theaters they are miles ahead of their saturday morning counterparts,positive,1
this is a rather dull movie about a scientist that creates a teleporter device and gets horribly disfigured when he uses the machine to transport himself simple plot done before in the fly and others not only does he get disfigured but he also can electrocute people with a touch what is really dumb about this film is that we are expected to believe the place this guy works is against him he could probably make millions for the institution that he is working at but the head of the institution tries to sabotage his teleporter every step of the way in the end the projected man electrocutes three people for no reason then goes after those that have wronged him,negative,0
the reason why people say that this movie scared them is because it did that means the movie purpose was felt by a few who did see it when i first saw this movie it scared me and made me think about life and religion this is not a blood and gore scary type movie but the kind that you would think that it may be possible for things to happen the way the movie was written of course non believers will say its only a scifi movie truth is this movie is a must have for your thriller collection even if it does have a religious view if you are a fan of classic thrillers omenetc this is one of them and its a must have i never saw the sequel distant thunder but i believe it picks up where this movie ends,positive,1
this is truly without exaggerating one of the worst slasher movies ever made i know it came out in the 80s following a tendency started by friday the 13th the prey copies the forementioned movie in many aspects the woods setting the killer the dumb teens the gore etc  but the prey is as bad as you might expect i didnt even remember about it if it wasnt for coincidence  well the killer is in fact human so dont expect a supernatural killer in the likes of jason the situations rather boring and lack of tension gore violence etc it just does not works for a slasher flick  the acting is simply horrid the score is horrible a combination of boring instruments with cheesy 80s tunes i wont even mention the technical aspects of the movie because believe me it seems that it cost only 20 dollars  please avoid this one like the plague its one of the worst movies ive ever seen and thats something to say thank god it seems to have vanished from earth,negative,0
i guess i was prepared after all the years of hearing about it first heard about it from siskel and ebert when they said divine ate excrement i had to look it up then a friend told me about it in 1991 she said also that her parents saw it when it first came out and that her mom almost dumped her dad over it so by the time i caught pink flamingos on sundance today i was prepared for the most part  i still couldnt help but be surprised by the anal closeups and the blowjob scene that said the only characters i sympathized with were edie and the egg man her crying scene early in the film though over something frivolous to normal people actually makes me sad though she sure wasnt pretty she had a cute voice i was happy for her and the egg man and they actually touched me  on the other hand the acting in this povertylevel production was not good and as for the script just how does john waters come up with this stuff well at least its different,negative,0
im glad i rented this movie for one reason its shortcomings made me want to read allendes book and get the full story   pros the movie is beautiful the period is depicted well and consistently to the best of my knowledge and meryl and glenn do good jobs  cons this is the worst acting job ive ever seen from jeremy ironsi kept wondering if something was wrong with his mouth and i hate the terribly english way he says transito winona ryder does nothing believable except look young and idealistic most of the other performances are ok but so few things hang together in the character arcs and the relationship development that i was frustrated and angry well before the end   im very curious now whether this movie is typical of bille augusts work i may have to drop another couple of bucks to rent smillas sense of snow,negative,0
stairway to heaven is a outstanding invention of movie making probably never duplicated i rank it with the wizard of oz and african queen although it is a totally different type of movie than african queen stairway to heaven is a psychodrama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that to my knowledge are totally unique   for example there is the combination of bw and color footage  as in oz but the significance of the contrast goes way beyond the simple  but beautiful  effect achieved in oz in stairway the purpose and effect of the contrast can only be described as powerful  another brilliant aspect of stairway is the concept of time and how it is used here how could anybody have conceived of a better way to make time stand still  literally and then there is the stairway itself  if you have any imagination at all you will agree with me stairway to heaven is a true gem,positive,1
the not the best movie in the world that was an understatement i personally didnt like this movie at all not because of the story line not because of the graphic violence and the nudity the nudity didnt really need to be in it it did nothing for the story except maybe the girls were going through a rough time and being naked probably messed them up even more but one of the things in the movie that i hated was that it was sooooo dark you couldnt really make out what was going on i think if it wasnt as dark and you could see where they were then it might not have been so bad all you know that its a basement somewhere you see no house no road the killer in it all you could see was half his face for about 5 seconds i wanna see some stuff in a movie it gets boring after 20 mins of pretty much darkness and all you see occasionally is a flashlight or a wall then you will hear the girl sobbing there was nothing that really stuck out to me that was good about the movie maybe the suspense in the first 10 mins of the film but not the suspense of how the movie is going to end but the suspense of will i get to see anything in this movie but a few naked bodies and various flashing lights but honestly people this was a saw meets blair witch project wannabe both top notch movies and both with the correct lighting to figure out what was going on forget this movie if you can see if your a blind person you might wanna rent it to hear the screams if your into that sort of thing but then again if you are blind your probably not reading this either so anyway bad movie,negative,0
well there you have it another disillusion on my account two actually first of all even though i like to think of myself that i know a little something about 70s euroexploitation and its most prolific contributors i never heard about joseph w sarno before heres a guy who made over seventy rancid and cultladen exploitation movies and i havent seen a single one how why what happened here secondly and even worse just when you think to have found a new source for obscure cult movies that directors most famous and supposed masterpiece turns out to be an irredeemably dull and irritating film admittedly lesbian vampire movies form a pretty insignificant sub genre as a whole but some of them bath in ominous atmosphere and curious sensuality like josé larraz vampyres or harry kümmels daughters of darkness joseph sarnos film has nothing to offer except copious amounts of gratuitous nudity and even that becomes boring rather quickly the events take place in a secluded old castle hidden deep in the german mountains where five centuries ago lived a malicious and bloodthirsty literally baroness her loyal disciples still throw naked dance parties in the castles catacombs which are lit by penisshaped candlesauch and hope to resurrect the baroness any time soon now suddenly dont even ask how the castle is full of young and sexy female guests so even more erotic rites ensue sounds delicious and entertaining enough but the devils plaything contains a massive number of sequences where literally nothing happens and where the cast members ignorant facial expressions are simply unendurable sarno isnt capable of creating suspense or building a gothic atmosphere or maybe he just didnt bother to and the actresses capacities restrict themselves to standing in front the camera topless and pull a really pathetic face please do yourself a favor no matter how desperately you strive to see all lurid lesbianvampire movies of the 70s this one isnt worth a penny even the repertoires of jess franco and jean rollin are pure art compared to this dud,negative,0

the writers and creators of this film should actually be sued for polluting the world with this crap man in the mirror is in fact beyond horrible way way way beyond   and people im not just saying that because im a michael jacksonfan or due to the fact that this is truly one of the most retarded depictions of his life ive ever encountered   im saying it because this is a waste of time money and celluloid i feel ashamed of myself just having seen all of it thats 1 hour and 26 min of my life ill never get back im telling you watching grass grow is literally more entertaining than this film   consider yourselves warned,negative,0
miranda cosgrove is known for her debut in school of rock with jack black and her role as megan in the show drake and josh and she has become a fan favorite amongst the nickelodeon public so it isnt a surprise that dan schneider would create a show just for her unfortunately it ends up being as bad as if not worse than the amanda show  icarly is about three friends carly sam and freddie who have become idols in the junior high community through a webcam show called icarly carly and sam are the hosts and freddie shoots and puts it up on the internet carly also has an older brother named spencer acted by the hilarious jerry trainor who is known for his work in drake and josh as crazy steve  well let me tell you this dont believe the 83 out of 10 this show received because it is pathetic in nearly every aspect dan schneider probably went through about 5 minutes of studying teenage interests because all i see is him saying ipod iphone ihome aha teenagers love anything beginning with i and a majority of gigs that were used in drake and josh if not then they are just really dry and forced jokes that dont even count on a generousity chuckle such as you want me to turn up the ac to 60 degrees no we want you to turn it up to 60 pickles not only that but if you look closely nearly all the sets in the shows were used in drake and josh and neds declassified that were simply spitandpolished with random stuff to try and make it look different  the scenes where the show is showing a broadcast of the icarly network is just as terrible as the entire series itself the dialogue in them is atrociously bad which may be accepted by some since it is just two friends playing around in front of a camera but whats the deal with the really odd humorless antics they do like random dancing and it just gets worse from there  in terms of acting miranda and jennette arent at their best by far nathan kress who played freddie isnt believable at times but he does an okay job the person who really steals the show is the humorous prowess of jerry trainor who fits in his protective older brother role very well and his wideeyed loudmouthed acting can make for some pretty funny segments too bad they arent frequent because that might have given the show an extra star in my opinion  dan schneider must have made this show for the sole purpose of giving miranda cosgrove her own cableborn playground to hop around and spew unfunny jokes and pathetic cuecard lines in every direction because everyone else has exceptional talent buried underneath the poorlydone script and weightless acting dan schneider did a great job with drake and josh so its a real disappointment that icarly is such a failure jerry trainors acting saved this show from a 1 out of 10 rating but he alone cant save icarly from being as horrible as it is,negative,0
  one of the best films ive ever seen robert duvalls performance was excellent and outstanding he did a wonderful job of making a character really come to life his character was so convincing it made me almost think i were in the theater watching it live i give it 5 stars,positive,1
there are a select few cartoon films where animals or something not human is portraying human beings and i think that this film is one of them apart from a few points of the plot and the characters  this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals although  its good someone did not  i feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans   this film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues  which is rather odd for a disney film it mentions alcohol shows a dog teaching another dog how to attack tresspassing humans and it shows a male cat called abraham delacy gieuseppe casi thomas o malley fancying a female cat in a surprisingly human and adult way  as a cartoon film  or just a film in general i feel this is pretty good quality  the storyline and characters are especially good the film in general is set in france and you meet a family of cats  the mother duchess and her kittens marie toulouse and berlioz you also meet the kind rich old woman who adores the cats the butler edgar and an old man who has clearly lost his marbles called george the kind old woman discusses her will with george and edgar overhears that what he receives from the will he will have after the cats have it he is incredibly cross with this  and has an evil scheme in mind  a very cute film for every age  enjoy aristocats  not including basil the great mouse detective and a few others maybe which i cannot think of at the moment,positive,1
i saw this movie unfortunately because it was the only option at that time and because david zucker was the director i saw his previous naked gun both parts airplane and top secret and i liked at least i had a good time and laughed im not saying that the movies i mentioned were master pieces but were ok i dont recall any other more stupid movie than this its incredible how hollywood industry is in total decadence if some studio spends any money to produce this awful picture then is not a surprise that this kind of histories are more common on these days this is a clear reflect of a decadent civilization where sex symbols and stupid plots are produced to entertain the common people i dont have any good to say about this film if you are planning to rent it or buy it please dont waste your money or your time avoid it no matter what even if you are fan of one of the actors does not worth it in fact this could be a very good example of what a director should avoid i wont see a zucker movie again he is planning to direct the fourth sequel of scary movie imagine that pathetic awful,negative,0
i took this out arbitrarily from the library the other night having no idea of the films cult influence or that it is currently being staged as a musical most of the comments here are on target its moving funny sad and yes a tad exploitive despite the best intentions of the filmmakers the expanded chriterion edition is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out   i think you can also see in little edie the fall of a class that sort of disappeared you can hear it in old films of jackie o too people just dont talk like that anymore i think as a documentary it would have been interesting to get more information about how the home fell into disrepute old edie at least still seems aware of whats going on to a certain degree couldnt she see the once spectacular home disintegrating   yet the films subject is the life the two women have constructed for themselves now a real life tennesse williams one act well worth your time,positive,1
whoopi was the only reason i watched the oscars that year she is hilarious of course there was a major serious side to the show she was great not only because shes funny but because she said some things that needed to be said in a public forum white folks need to be reminded that hollywood awards ceremonies employment and representation are way out of balance racially there should be no need for black awards shows the whitebread milquetoast nominators and judges need to bring their heads into the sunshine and see that great material is not limited to white directors producers actors etc allowing woody allen on the air was the depth of poor taste he had no business being there the fact of the matter is this is the first oscar presentation ive watched since the color purple was up for awards that miscarriage of voting soured me on watching the shows until 2002 which is not to denigrate other presenters billy crystal is a riot,positive,1
if the crew behind zombie chronicles ever read this heres some advice guys   1 in a twist endingtype movie its not a good idea to insert closeups of every death in the movie in the opening credits that tends to spoil the twists yknow   2 i know you produced this on a shoestring and  to be fair  you worked miracles with your budget but please hire people who can actually act or at least walk talk and gesture at the same time joe haggerty im looking at you  3 if youre going to set a part of your movie in the past only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time  4 twist endings are supposed to be a surprise sure we dont want twists that make no sense but signposting the reveal as soon as you introduce a character thats not a great idea  kudos to the guys for trying but in all honesty id rather they hadnt  only for zombie completists,negative,0
i was looking forward to this flick being an old robert e howard fan mainly from a conan standpoint   i was not expecting a great deal and thought they could not mess it up too much oh dear  how wrong was i  the main flaw was it was fairly dull it needed to zip along with a nice helping of supernatural goingson swordfights and the like  you got some gore but everything else was just pretty lifeless the middle section just seemed to involve 40 minutes in a muddy forest with slow plodding horsedrawn carts and even slower dialogue and character development  on the plus side  costumes and effects were fine but not enough to keep your interest  i think it would have been better to tone down the gore up the tempo and go for a 12a rating as a ten year old boy i may have liked this movie probably about the age i was first reading the conan stories funny enough perhaps that says a lot about my anticipation of the film  or go really arthouse with tone direction etc but thats fairly highrisk as far as box office is concerned  oh well perhaps the next conan movie will make up for it,negative,0
this is a terrible remake of a marginal but well liked movie from the early 70s i have seen the original at least 6 times the 1997 version is a 20 minute movie crammed into 2 hours or whatever the runtime is cheesy storyline which by the way is completely different than the original the major government involvement was farfetched there is no flow from one scene to the next in the original you could go get a beer or hit the bathroom and still keep up   it only took a few hours movie time to change the oil pan on the car it takes many times longer than that in real life car guys notice this stuff also the fool or fools that chose to trash a 1968 charger and abuse a 1970 challenger should be shot in the heel with a dull bullet the fact they arent car people is painfully obvious and their passing will not be grieved   the actors lacked any emotion everything was cut and dried one step above a monotone a barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic  last but surely not least the radio dj made the statement that the challenger hit the bulldozers at 180 or 185  that is total garbage can you say aerodynamics or lack thereof hahahaha this movie is a joke dont waste your time watching this one,negative,0
this is my favorite renoir from the fifties its the story of how henri danglard built and launched the moulin rouge nightclub we see the workmen blasting at the site to get construction underway and the training of the dancers finally the giddiness of opening night and the long sequence of cancan dancing financial problems and the ego displays of the performers are described  gabin is in great form as the easygoing danglardsee him deal humorously with ninis violent boyfriend gianni esposito is moving as the wistful prince who is courting nini maria felix with that amazons body is imposing as the egotistical lola danglards first lover finally françoise arnoul as nini the washing girl who ends up dancing for danglard and becoming his girl is just stunning her loveliness and pert charm will win you over  a bonus we get edith piaf patachou andré claveau and other stars in cameos playing the stars of a century ago who ruled over the moulin rouge,positive,1
xizao is a rare little movie it is simple and undemanding and at the same time so rewarding in emotion and joy the story is simple and the theme of old and new clashing is wonderfully introduced in the first scenes this theme is the essence of the movie but it would have fallen flat if it wasnt for the magnificent characters and the actors portraying them  the aging patriarch master liu is a relic of chinas preexpansion days he runs a bath house in an old neighbourhood every single scene set in the bath house is a source of jelaousy for us stressed out unhappy people not even hardened cynics can find any flaws in this wonderful setting  master lius mentally handicapped son er ming is the second truly powerful character in the movie coupled with his modernlife brother the interactions between these three people and the various visitors to the bath house are amazingly detailed and heartfelt with some scenes packing so much emotion its beyond almost everything seen in movies  with its regimecritical message this movie was not only censored but also given unreasonably small coverage it could be a coincidence but when a movie of this caliber is virtually impossible to find even on the internet you cant help getting suspicious  so help free speech and the movie world buy rent copy this wonderful movie and if you happen to own the dvd if there even is one then share share share,positive,1

who could possibly sympathize with these two obnoxious protagonists whats intended to be a light frothy comedy about neighbor children who cant give up their childhood game of dare even as they age well into adulhood comes off more as an exercise in cruelty and petulant selfindulgence as children the pair are unbearably precocious as adults theyre intolerably immature its a bad combination,negative,0
when i bought this film i expected to get a fun 1970s exploitation film instead i got this bore fest by amateur auteur andy milligan ah andy milligan with his tight editing breakneck pacing  and wonderfully well known actors youd almost think youre watchingone of his home movies seriously i couldnt even stay awake the first time i tried to watch it the scenes of boring people dragged on an on and whenever someone got killed the film would slow down sometimes it would speed up too making the characters voices sound like chipmunks which was probably the best thing about this film the script actually seemed a bit better than the film and seems more well suited to be in a soap opera than in a grainy 70s sleeping pill where the actors constantly stumble over its lines the cover said their prime cuts were curiously eroticbut thoroughly brutal trust me there is nothing erotic about this film oh we do get to see characters that resemble extra lumpy cottage cheese making out but thats about it and as far as brutal well the viewer is brutalized the most with this here film and another thing,negative,0
i thought that this movie was pretty lame if youre looking for cheesey you may like this i myself dont mind a fair amount of cheese but this was ridiculous the progression of the movie bored me and the storyline was very weak  the only thing entertaining about this movie was the dayglo zombies but even that isnt reason enough to see this flick,negative,0
i have done a lot of international travel both on business and as a tourist for both types i assure you the best advice is also the oldest always drink the wine of the country in this movie the archangel michael comes to earth on business wraps it up quickly and decides to hang around for a little touring boy does he drink the wine of the country  could man be drunk forever with liquor love and fights   hed lief rise up of mornings and lief lie down of nights  these are things you cant do in heaven so he enjoys them while hes here of course it turns out he had a couple of other jobs to tackle and if he is less direct about them than he was about the first one he is just as successful the final scene is a little schmaltzy but it is also wonderful jean stapleton gets to dance with john travolta,positive,1
of all the football films i have watched this is one of the 2 best the other being fever pitch but hero is about the greatest world cup ever and consequently arguably also the greatest player ever to play in a world cup diego maradona this story is centered around him principally but also revolves around the other giants of the game at the time  the musical score is evocative and the images are powerful the narration by michael caine is suitably unbiased and also calmly dramatic this story is not about the individual games of the world cup rather it is more about the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itself  exciting games like france v brazil one of the greatest games of all time  were covered in the same vein the final argentin v w germany was also in the same vein highly recommended a classic of world football to be watched over and over again esp if youre a maradona fan,positive,1
watching fire and ice for the first time reminded me of my experience seeing 300 last year it wasnt at all a bad movie certainly not average but its plotting and dialog stuck out as being at best conventional and at worst kind of confusing and onedimensional which perhaps as based on frank millers comic book was the right decision to go with but its primary strengths drew from the intense action and bloody battles and having that jolt of a 14 year old feeling watching beefcake men fighting in bloody swordled combat with the occasional freaky creature or superhot female to go with the painterly surroundings while i would probably rewatch fire and ice before 300 again they both aroused that similar feeling  the exception this time being naturally that its frank frazetta the infamous artist and designer of countless paperback books and comics collaborating with director ralph bakshi in what isnt typical hollywood fare but something for the diehard fans  what this means for audiences today going back to check out the film for the first time it may now be coveted nostalgia for those who were young and watched it along with their masters of the universe vhs tapes back in the day is the possible cons mentioned before and maybe that you will see something somewhat unique fire and ice isnt even the only bakshi rotoscoped feature but its possibly the most fluid if not quite my personal favorite of the few he made and he and his team create a whole striking world thats part prehistoric part outofthisworld fantastic and part medieval and all touched up with a painters hand with respect to the backgrounds the skies and grounds theres a slight drawback for bakshi fans in this facet of character design bakshi went as far as to say its more frazetta than him this may be true but it doesnt make it any more absorbing to the eye or curious in those moments where we dont see people killed or gutted in quick or slow motion my favorite was the momentary skeletonguide how they rotoscoped that amazes me  i neglect describing the plot as it would defeat the purpose of really recommending it if youre already a diehard into this kind of style and approach of animation the plot will matter depending on what degree two warring factions or a damsel or princess is in danger or a hero has to prove himself or yada yada so suffice to say its about well fire against ice with characters named nekron and darkwolf the coolest male of the lot and most comicbook in appearance and teegra the typical hottie whos almost too perfect for the adolescent male fantasy figure what the plot does do as an asset is allow a series of cliffhangers and suspense bits around the action the progression of the danger in the oncoming big battle like when the ogres are hunting after teegra and have to contend with sudden crazy monsters and creatures popping out of tree trunks and lakes and per usual for bakshi he conjures up some craziness if not quite his usual inspired lunacy in the midst of all of this straightforward fantasy material if youve seen wizards youll understand what i mean to a lesser extent  so if youre an animation buff seek this out right away for some oldschool ie 1980s action and incredible design for everyone else its good not great as i would say without fault about its logical 21st century extension with some alterations 300,positive,1
this movie took me by surprise the opening credit sequence features nicely done animation after that were plunged into a semicheesy production betraying its low budget the characters typical american teens are introduced slowly with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this by the time the shlitz hits the fan we know each one of the characters and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities its a slow uphill setup kind of like the ride up a slope of a really tall roller coaster thankfully once the action kicks in its full blown old school horror steve johnsons makeup effects are awesome equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films and the scares are jolting kevin tenney delivers his best movie ever with heartstopping surprises and creepy suspenseful setups the tongueincheek sometimes cheesy humor marks this film as pure 80s horror as opposed to the sullen tone of earlier genre fare like night of the living dead or hills have eyes but for true horror fans this one is worth checking out play it as the first entry on a double bill with the 1999 remake of house on the haunted hill the setup and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder what film they were actually remaking,positive,1

this has got to be one of those films where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itselfi first saw the trailer in 1991 it looked greatsince then i have always wanted to see it but could never find ituntil today yes 14 years later  lets just say i was so disappointed its unreal ok i knew it wouldnt be an oscar winner but still had hopes that it would be a fun nobrain film in the bloodsport mold unfortunately it was not its pooh  whats with all the american rock and roll music and the acting was so bad it was quite frightening  the fight scenes were rubbish and look fake  this dvd only cost me £5 and i believe i was overcharged by £7  now im sad as i know that i will never get that hour and a half back,negative,0
this is an unusual film because although it was made by twentiethcentury fox because its one of the few pairings of barbara stanwyck and her future husband robert taylor barbara stanwyck had been making films for many different studios rko paramount and selznick at about the time she made this is my affair but taylor was an mgm contract player so he only appeared in this film because he was loaned to foxsomething studios occasionally did during this era  the film is interesting because many reallife people have roles in the film though the piece is otherwise pure fiction youll see actors playing william mckinley teddy roosevelt and admiral dewey i cant recall any film with mckinley or dewey in it as a character though i do remember roosevelt from the wind and the lion and a couple other films three cheers for seeing a lesser president in a film as a major character   the film begins with mckinley taking a young lieutenant robert taylor aside and asking him to be a special agent for himand telling no onenot even the secret service thats because the president fears that someone within the agency is tipping off a gang that has been making a long string of robberiesall based on inside information so its up to taylor who is not known for his manly rolesespecially at this stage of his career to pose as a thug and find the gang responsible and the inside man  however there are two serious complications first while he is able to find the gang members one of the gang members stepsister is stanwyck taylor finds that hes fallen in love with her but he must also do his duty and turn them in to the authorities second because mckinley is the only other person who knows the truth serious problems develop when mckinley is assassinated and taylor is on death row for the crimes   the film did a nice job of creating a story and placing it within a historical context while today most people dont remember mckinley nor remember that he was assassinated the film is set in this interesting time period the acting is pretty decent as the stars are supported by victor mclaglen and brian donlevy though i must admit that donlevys role was pretty tame and ordinary compared to many of his other film roles overall its very interesting well written and not too sappy in the romance department a good outing for all,positive,1
this documentary was interesting but it was also long so long it lasts a total of 225 minutes like benhur long but if your into that this is for you but only if you have a passion for movies like i do being that martin scorsese is my favorite director live and maybe even ever this is quite fascinating especially if you know the style of scorseses works because then you can understand where he got his inspiration for many of his films not the best documentary film ever made but it is a leap for scorsese which is always good to watch a,positive,1
it was fabulous the photography editing cinematography music combined to transport us to the dangerous side of a tourist destination it was the enjoyment of slumming without going through the danger we were there the dream sequences and flashbacksequenceending were fresh it spoke to me keep up the good work another of that genre is city of god also  dont laugh  the comedy desperately seeking susan nice ensemble types with great performances by all sorry i think training day fits that genre as well with fantastic performances by an ensemble cast i had to switch the channel on some of the gritty sequences but allinall a great film,positive,1
  back in his youth the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin but his family forbid it many decades later the old man has raised three children two boys and one girl and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children soon the sister is bored with brother 1 and jumps in the bed of brother 2  one might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island but no  they are upper class europeans going to college and busy in the social world  never do we see a flirtatious moment between any nonrelated female and the two brothers never do we see any flirtatious moment between any nonrelated male and the one sister all flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister  the weakest part of gladiator was the incest thing the young emperor commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriageminded girls all over him but no  he only wanted his sister if movie incest is your cup of tea then sunshine will slowly thrill you to no end,negative,0
the action scenes was quite good but the plot of the movie i would have to give it a score of 1 out of 10 it seems that the producers and director of this movie didnt thought about it carefully  it doesnt give much value and values to its viewers except for its violence the entire story was about revenge a boy witnessing a rape and murder i would even recommend it to be banned those who watched it youve just lose some money if youre thinking of watching it watch something else i would ask for a refund if i was on a movie theater so for you guys and girls out there reading this article please dont waste time,negative,0
one of the more sensible comedies to hit the hindi film screens a remake of priyadarshans 80s malayalam hit boeing boeing which in turn was a remake of the 60s hollywoon hit of the same name garam masala elevates the standard of comedies in hindi cinema  akshay kumar has once again proved his is one of the best super stars of hindi cinema who can do comedy he has combined well with the new hunk john abraham however john still remains in akshays shadows and fails to rise to the occasion  the new gals are cute and do complete justice to their roles  a must watch comedy leave your brains away and laugh for 2 hrs after all laughter is the best medicine  ask priyadarshan and akshay kumar ,positive,1
this movie stinks imdb needs negative numbers in its rating system to properly evaluate this turkey the acting is either wooden or over the top the film was apparently not written by anyone in particular and the monster scenes were mediocre at best even as a movie driven solely by the monster scenes those shots were so disappointing that they could not inspire any sympathy for the rest of the movie i want the 80 minutes of my life back that this movie stole,negative,0
the plot of this enjoyable mgm musical is contrived and only occasionally amusing dealing with espionage and romance but the focus of the film is properly pointed upon the tuneful interludes showcasing the enormously talented and athletic tap dancing eleanor powell abetted by tommy dorsey and his orchestra featuring ziggy elman buddy rich and frank sinatra red skelton shares top billing with powell and he and sidekick bert lahr are given most of the comedic minutes although skelton is more effective when he if it can be believed performs as powells love interest with virginia obrien actually providing most of the films humor as the dancers companion the technical brilliance of powell is evidenced during one incredible scene within which buddy rich contributes his drumming skills and which must be viewed several times in order to permit ones breathing to catch up with her precision director edward buzzell utilizes his large cast well to move the action nicely along despite the rather disjointed script with which he must deal and permits powells cotangent impossibilities to rule the affair as is appropriate,positive,1
this is one of my all time favourites all the actors do a great job comparing this movie to lawrence of arabia does no justice to both movies the wind and the lion levels a much lower budget with fantastic actors portraying heartwarming characters in a heartwarming atmosphere action and beautiful pictures are provided as well which all together guarantees a favourite movie to me,positive,1
before seeing this movie i was expecting a fictional drama based loosely on ideas from the book instead its the book interrupted with dramatic scenes illustrating the different illnesses that didnt bother me much but it hindered my enjoyment of the film one story or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book interspersed through the movie would have been preferable in my opinion if youre going to base a movie on a psychology text youve got to find a more interesting and preferably accurate text than this one the film drags during parts where its little more than a video encyclopedia of 19th century sexual psychology and would be utterly intolerable if it werent sexual in nature because sex  interesting for most of us even me luckily there are several stories with actual character development that pull us in  but disappointingly krafftebings theories of sexuality went unchallenged for the most part i was hoping it would use stories to show how the imperfections of his archaic view of psychology which is still held by many to this day  so in the end what do you have a detailed catalog of a few fetishes and orientations with some mildly interesting stories showing the trials and tribulations of a few sexual deviants before they are cured for most of the film the film moves with the crawling speed and mood of a wake and as an obviously low budget film the cinematography and acting are not exactly top tier although i was pleased with the music costume and interior design  i felt this films subject was right up my alley and i still feel its a below average film it deserves a 310 a 410 if i were feeling extremely generous i cant imagine anyone enjoying this if they didnt already have an interest in sexual fetishism,negative,0

this movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel  quirky and obnoxious characters a few quirky town with quirky folk a quirky coffee shop or restaurant coffee shop here lots of shots of canadian stuff for postcards ocean stuff here lots of mention of gotta get out of this town downright booooring  and it succeeds on all counts  something to note though i couldnt figure out whether this movie was just trying to be postnorthern exposure quirky comedy or something surreal like a druginduced or psychotic hallucination the editing of this movie jumped around nonsensically from one unrelated thing to another with zero pacing or motivation not to mention the fact that half the time we didnt even know where we were jumping take for instance the very opening shots of yelling teens in a car who are they and what the h did they have to do with anything and this sub  uh  plot use that word plot loosely concering kids that seem to span generations i dont think they actually do but the editing makes it look like they materialize from flashback all of a sudden to current time huh what did i miss  avoid unless for laughs or you want to try and trip out on the inept editing,negative,0

it is not known whether marilyn monroe ever met and spoke with albert einstein and since the mysterious disappearance of her diary after her equally mysterious death we may never know but in their lifetime the opportunity was there  scripted by terry johnson from his own play nicolas roegs insignificance imagines an encounter in a new york hotel room one night in 1953 between the two icons plus joe dimaggio busey and senator joseph mccarthy curtis  but only on one level on another level it elevates  or reduces  these personalities and what a lousy phrase that is to mere avatars the characters are deliberately unnamed at once greater and lesser in status  the title insignificance is both apposite and deeply ironic here dimaggios net worth has been reduced to little more than a picture on a bubblegum card monroe too is reduced to her constituent parts of dress hair lipstick wiggle and voice by uncovering their insecurities and reversing their roles the film brings into sharp focus received notions of celebrity exploding the cult of personality  furthering the theme there will be another explosion at the films climax hiroshima in a hotel suite in which the actress is burned to a cinder in seconds a literal deconstruction of fame goodbye norma jean history informs the script which in turn shakes history upside down as roeg mused after watching johnsons play for the first time these characters were mythic not invented by any single person not the public or the press probably not even by the characters themselves as played by theresa russell marilyn a closet intellectual in real life lectures a childlike einstein the professor played by emil on the theory of relativity using balloons and a flashlight while getting the professor to show off his legs in conscious parody of her own role in the sevenyear itch the movie the actress is seen to be working on in the films opening  history records that monroes thenhusband fading baseball star dimaggio played by busey as a tenderly psychotic simpleton was unhappy about her iconic dresssplaying scene in the film precipitating their breakup right on cue we discover the jealous ballplayer in a bar bemoaning the fact that if i want to see her underwear i just walk down to the corner like all the other guys  in contrast to the professor the ballplayer believes the universe is round  a contention shared by native americans but the big chief sampson of one flew over the cuckoos nest fame who operates the roosevelt hotels elevator has been all but disenfranchised from his own culture i no longer cherokee  i watch tv meanwhile the senator is investigating the professor who is on the eve of delivering a pacifist speech to the united nations but whom the senator suspects is a red in fact as he divulges to monroe einstein is wracked with guilt over hiroshima and what the white heat future holds yet in a seemingly godless universe all such worries and aspirations are rendered insignificant in the light of a higher atomic power  roeg really is the perfect director to bring johnsons stage play to the screen throughout tortured childhood flashbacks and pessimistic flashforwards kaboom draw unexpected connections between time place and circumstance with the repeated visual motif of a wristwatch employed to mark times passing  but perhaps also to suggest all time is one time each moment coexisting as evinced by his back catalogue its something of a hobbyhorse for a director enchanted with the notion of synchronicity  see dont look now in particular here 1920 bleeds into 1945 and dripfeeds into the 1980s a period in which another actor has taken on his greatest role as the president of the united states  if all this sounds rather heavy going quantum physics is surely involved the execution is anything but owing to johnsons witty zippy screenplay roegs playful direction opening out an essentially stagey setup  and the cast themselves who are on stellar form tony curtis especially leaves denture marks in the wood panelling as the paranoid impotent senator who is seen attempting congress with a monroe impersonator a real one as opposed to russells before being let down by his dwindling member  of course curtis once costarred with the real marilyn monroe in some like it hot and whose embrace he memorably described as like kissing hitler as roeg commented everything suddenly seemed connected when the film began to take shape even the actors themselves seemed part of this endless linking it all goes into the pot to be boiled down and served up in new and fascinating ways,positive,1
most people will consider that yul brynners greatest performance was as the ruler of siam in the king and i certainly it gave him a wide variety of moods to test his abilities in from comic to tragic from eager to learn to dominating to hateful it also showed him to advantage as a talk singer and a dancer finally as it was also his tony award winning performance from broadway the film allowed us to capture something of the great broadway performance as well  but he did other movies that showed his talents as well as the king and i his comic turn in once more with feeling was quite nice so was his performance as general bunin in anastasia or his ramses in the ten commandments yet he came terribly close to being a 1950s successor to eric von stroheim as the man you love to hate a certain vulnerability in his acting and roles endeared him to the movie public even after his best years as a star were behind him  and he retreated more and more to repeating the king of siam on television and the stage  to me his finest performance is in this 1959 drama with deborah kerr jason robards jr robert morley e g marshall anne jackson and ronnie howard the film is set in pretty modern times  the powderkeg that was hungary in 1956 when briefly it looked like the iron curtain was about to collapse there under the reforms of hungarian patriot imre nagy and his supporters but the hungarian revolution collapsed due to bad timing the russians and their polish and east german allies sent tanks in to crush the revolt and arrested and executed nagy and other reformers the west stood by and let this happen england and france had gotten caught in the suez crisis and the us had berated them and israel for attacking egypt due to the actions of three close allies of the us the west found it hard to condemn the overkill of the soviet union it was an unfortunate situation and the hungarians have never forgotten how they were abandoned in it  in the film brynner is major surov a russian intelligence officer who is watching for some of the leaders of the hungarian revolt one of whom is paul kedes jason robards kedes may be getting assistance from some westerners on a bus tour through hungary led by robert morley including marshall jackson and howard and kerr the latter are being kept in a hotel while their bus is being repaired and brynner mingles with them hoping for a lead to the whereabouts of robards but brynner is human  he tries to be ingratiating with these people all of whom see him as a monster and in sequence when he has drunk a little too much he confronts them with the questions that has bothered historians since 1945 how is it even if one notes that russia had stalin in charge that relations between russia and the west collapsed so quickly the allies on the whole had worked well together from 1941 to 1945 but after yalta and potsdam all types of mutual suspicions just erupted did they have to surov is a good officer but he is torn in half by loyalty to the communist regimes in the soviet union and in hungary that he supports and his growing fondness towards kerr who is hiding robards but is also willing to note the more human side of the russian major and as the film reaches its tragic climax we watch as surov has to decide if he will follow his sense of duty or take pity on kerr robards and the other westerners who want to leave it becomes a true struggle for him  and one that he may win far too late it was a great film about a tragedy of post war europe and possibly the most thoughtful role yul brynner ever portrayed,positive,1
stewart moss stars as a scientist who is on a working trip with his wife and one gets the feeling that he was picked for this role for his ability to roll his eyes back in his headimagine the auditions for thiscan youno thats not quite it thank you next anyway hes bitten by a bat and then hes either changing into some kind of bat creature and killing people orhes not for no one else sees his strange transformations but he himself seems to think that hes changing because his wedding ring pops off when his hands turn into claws etc to its credit the movie does kind of hold back on whether hes just nuts or whether hes actually transforming into something until almost the very end this has some good locations  sort of a decent atmosphere at times but unfortunately none of that can make up for the somewhat lame story and the wonderfully bad acting kind of fun in a so bad its good way but leans more towards just plain bad 4 out of 10,negative,0

whats not to like about this movie every year you know that youre going to get one or two yule tide movies during christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible this movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well a very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real christmas for him what is the good of having money like that if you cant do fun things with it it was a winwin situation a regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience christmas like he imagined only if  drew latham ben affleck was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands it was a fun and funny movie,positive,1
oh how we have a misfire here a film so bad that your mind will wonder and drift away onto other things as it wastes your time with brain numbingly poor production values character stereotypes of the worst and racist kind since dw griffith referred to the chinese character in broken blossoms as the yellow man characters so unimaginative and unengaging that its difficult to watch as well as a narrative that plods along at such a slow stupid and pointless pace that you will question the very people who say they like this film  prizzis honor is a film that ends up being an absolute postmodern disaster in every which way possible the film is a messy and senseless disaster that has john huston directing kathleen turner and jack nicholson staring and everybody else filling in the gaps as either dumb stereotypes or supporting characters that weep on a phone now and again or bicker with a main character prizzis honor is a film that falls into a genre of neonoir comedy romance action gangster and overall crime  this twinned with its director and cast should be enough to propel it through some sort of a story some sort of a sequence of good scenes some sort of intelligence in the form of a screenplay or something else but no  what we get is a nasty and ugly film revolving around nothing at all  ill give a couple of examples of how shoddy this horror show of a film actually is firstly the film thinks its a love story and it thinks this for about an hour of its time of my time charley partanna nicholson is an assassin who kills people for a family that he works for in new york and yet he resembles his character out of one flew over the cuckoos nest more than an international hitman he meets and falls in love with irene walker turner who is another assassin and they hit it off but as the poor excuse for a plot plays out it appears all is not right i read that the plot for this film is a professional hit man and hit woman fall in love only to discover that they have each been hired to kill the other well yes thats true but that actual revelation doesnt happen until about twenty minutes to the end nicholson plays partanna like someone with an iq of 60 he walks around seemingly making observations and talking out loud about things he sees he talks like he is either drunk or has a more serious problem from within and worse of all we never get the feeling he is an assassin  one really poorly shot assassination early on that actually happens off screen is not enough to suggest this guy is a hardbodied best of the best international hitman  so with a main character who is unlikable and unrealistic we move to the script the first hour and a half is just a cinematic dead zone with what ever there is to suggest traces of life merely poor conventions partanna slouches around on the phone or in person asking the same things over and over again do i marry her do i love her what is love what do i do and it gets so repetitive its not even able to act as good humour this twinned with the way he always seemed to be on the phone to someone a girl called maerose prizzi huston played by director johns daughter which served absolutely no purpose to the plot whatsoever and seemed to be there for laughs as was the scene in which she tells her father about how she slept with partanna and loved it  that got me thinking was this supposed to be funny should i be laughing the film felt like a smart mafia picture what with its opening scene of a wedding alá the godfather and consequential scenes with a touch of noir as gangsters police men and assassins were introduced into the film but what we get is something very very different  the second hour revolves around some sort of a kidnap plot right the love and romance is dealt with  maybe the film will kickstart i was so very wrong with more characters continuously talking very slowly and very deliberately in a monotone way we have a kidnap scene involving some guy coming out of his office this scene sums the film up everything is briefly planned and then executed in a heavy handed and dumb way that just makes it look cheesy we do not get to see them arrive to some dramatic music perhaps they have to get through security to get to the elevators maybe they have to be careful of civilians when they hide in their chosen places and when that random woman steps out of the elevator and the gunshot occurs  the scene isnt even edited correctly some suspense some drama do i shoot or dont i maybe some slow motion as the character has to quick draw before its too late  anything but how it was actually executed prizzis honor continues its monotonous and uninteresting decent into filmic oblivion as it nears its climax its a film where cameras reflect in windows lights reflect in sides of cars and dead chauffeurs blink when nudged prizzis honor is a jumbled and messy film that will try the patients of any filmgoer and dont say it was a comedy because i didnt laugh with it  at it is another matter the film is repetitive drawn out and colourless in its vision and scope for originality  there is no honour here,negative,0
just given the fact that it is based on the most infamous mass suicide incident of modern times would have been enough to give this 2part 1980 madefortv film attention but the fact is that it is a superb recreation of the life of the rev jim jones who built a church into a virtual empire and then encouraged it to disintegrate into a sleazy cult in which a congressman and his entourage were assassinated and 917 cult followers committed suicide by drinking koolaid doused with cyanide  done very tastefully but horrifying enough unlike the excruciatingly sadistic cult of the damned guyana tragedy features an allstar cast including ned beatty as rep leo ryan meg foster randy quaid brad dourif brenda vaccaro levar burton and madge sinclair but it is powers boothe in his first big role that really stands out as jim jones he actually becomes the man and his performance is riveting and chilling thus it is no wonder that this film still manages to attract attention after more than twenty years,positive,1
as a pagan i must say this movie has little if any magickal significance its a fun witchcraft movie and not meant to teach us anything except that love is the strongest magick of all and never to use it in a controlling or vengeful way thats a lesson everyone needs to learn not just pagans  that having been said this movie is wonderfully written and sweetly executed by kim novak and the venerable jimmy stewart  hermione gingold delivers a stellar performance as bianca elsa lanchester with too many movie credits to mention except as ms jane marbles of murder by death was wonderful as ms novaks absentmindedyetcapable upstairs neighbor queenie also starring jack lemmon wonderful performance and jim kovacs brilliantly witty  witches cant cry why they cant shed a single tear because their heart is full of magick they dont have time for silly things such as love queenie  gillian holroyd novak and her brother nicky jack lemmon are manhattan witches cloaked deeply within the secret underworld of those of the craft they live among other new yorkers as one of them without so much as causing a raised eyebrow   but then along comes shepherd shep henderson stewart a steadfast nononsense dedicated businessman who is engaged to be married to gillians old college rival   by a quirky mishap of chance he finds himself moving into gillians building and is instantly bewitched by her charm and grace by the use of magick with a little help from pyewacket gillians familiar trained by robert e blair and queenie gillian begins to work on this handsome new dream man to get back at her old enemy  but magick should never be used to control nor to hurt and gillian learns that the hard way in the most bittersweet way not only does she have to face what shes done but she has to face shep in her guilt   from the critical perspective however the movie takes a serious turn the effects are very dated to the point of being pure camp some of the scenery was seemingly shot in the basement of someones small home but at least the characters were quirky and fun  on a personal note pyewacket steals the show great cat great training by robert e blair   as a note of trivia this is the roots for the beloved bewitched television sitcom this introduces the original samantha and darrin all the characters of note are present and accounted for you have but to look to see it for yourself  this is one of my favorites and i watch it often  this movie gets a 9110 from  the fiend ,positive,1
i picked up this movie because it caught my eye as movie with a jewish comedy focus  something i had not seen before   i approached this film with an open mind and was interested in the way it began the opening is well put together and the first half of the film gave me many reasons to laugh and this is good  however the humor soon became repetitive the plot became confused and strained and i realized i was no longer enjoying the film i have tried to avoid saying this but the movie became rather cheap  not a bad thing for a comedy if the humor holds up but it didnt i confess that i may have missed some of the humour not being jewish myself and having little experience with jewish culture however considering how heavily telegraphed the bulk of the humour was in this film its unlikely i missed much  the idea is a good one and perhaps if a little more thought was put into it the film would have been watchable all the way through i wish i could give the movie a higher rating but strictly speaking it would have been better as a tv series or as a series of skits there was just not enough worthwhile fresh material for a fulllength movie  one thing to say about the casting  the lead role looked as if it had been designed with ben stiller in mind but i dont think the movie would have been any more worthwhile if he had been in it,negative,0
originally supposed to be just a part of a huge epic the year 1905 depicting the revolution of 1905 potemkin is the story of the mutiny of the crew of the potemkin in odessa harbor the film opens with the crew protesting maggoty meat and the captain ordering the execution of the dissidents an uprising takes place during which the revolutionary leader is killed this crewman is taken to the shore to lie in state when the townspeople gather on a huge flight of steps overlooking the harbor czarist troops appear and march down the steps breaking up the crowd a naval squadron is sent to retake the potemkin but at the moment when the ships come into range their crews allow the mutineers to pass through eisensteins nonhistorically accurate ending is openended thus indicating that this was the seed of the later bolshevik revolution that would bloom in russia the film is broken into five parts men and maggots drama on the quarterdeck an appeal from the dead the odessa steps and meeting the squadron  eisenstein was a revolutionary artist but at the genius level not wanting to make a historical drama eisenstein used visual texture to give the film a newsreellook so that the viewer feels he is eavesdropping on a thrilling and politically revolutionary story this technique is used by pontecorvos the battle of algiers  unlike pontecorvo eisenstein relied on typage or the casting of nonprofessionals who had striking physical appearances the extraordinary faces of the cast are what one remembers from potemkin this technique is later used by frank capra in mr deeds goes to town and meet john doe but in potemkin no one individual is cast as a hero or heroine the story is told through a series of scenes that are combined in a special effect known as montagethe editing and selection of short segments to produce a desired effect on the viewer dw griffith also used the montage but no one mastered it so well as eisenstein  the artistic filming of the crew sleeping in their hammocks is complemented by the graceful swinging of tables suspended from chains in the galley in contrast the confrontation between the crew and their officers is charged with electricity and the clenched fists of the masses demonstrate their rage with injustice  eisenstein introduced the technique of showing an action and repeating it again but from a slightly different angle to demonstrate intensity the breaking of a plate bearing the words give us this day our daily bread signifies the beginning of the end this technique is used in last year at marienbad also when the ships surgeon is tossed over the side his pincenez dangles from the rigging it was these glasses that the officer used to inspect and pass the maggotinfested meat this sequence ties the punishment to the corruption of the czaristera  the most noted sequence in the film and perhaps in all of film history is the odessa steps the broad expanse of the steps are filled with hundreds of extras rapid and dramatic violence is always suggested and not explicit yet the visual images of the deaths of a few will last in the minds of the viewer forever  the angular shots of marching boots and legs descending the steps are cleverly accentuated with long menacing shadows from a sun at the top of the steps the pace of the sequence is deliberately varied between the marching soldiers and a few civilians who summon up courage to beg them to stop a close up of a womans face frozen in horror after being struck by a soldiers sword is the direct antecedent of the bank teller in bonnie in clyde and gives a lasting impression of the horror of the czarist regime  the death of a young mother leads to a baby carriage careening down the steps in a sequence that has been copied by hitchcock in foreign correspondent by terry gilliam in brazil and brian depalma in the untouchables this sequence is shown repeatedly from various angles thus drawing out what probably was only a five second event  potemkin is a film that immortalizes the revolutionary spirit celebrates it for those already committed and propagandizes it for the unconverted it seethes of fire and roars with the senseless injustices of the decadent czarist regime its greatest impact has been on film students who have borrowed and only slightly improved on techniques invented in russia several generations ago,positive,1
the funniest scene of this movie is probably when our saviours get their medals and plaques and whatnot so the basic idea is the police outnumbers these gangsters by like a million to one but theyre powerless because the villains guns are just a bit bigger i guess police ammo just kinda bounces of they decided to shoot this movie in documentary style with fake interviews and all and seriously what is wrong with these guys theyre talking like they were armed with rolledup newspapers okay i admit its probably still dangerous to be in the line of the fire even when the situation is so much to your advantage but dont go nuts and why the hell did it take 44 minutes to solve everything anyway id say thats a very long time when you have them surrounded and youre allowed to shoot theyre like ten ft away they hit absolutely nothing then they go and buy bigger guns themselves to increase their heroism and then yeah there you have it one of the cops actually hits someone bullet was probably diverted by a lamp post or something i had a good laugh i guess,negative,0
daniel auteuils bruno in petites couperes is a middleaged model of his pierre in christian vincents la separation of 10 years ago in both films youthful confidence in leftwing ideology and love mutual metaphors crumbles into paranoia  manifesting itself as trapped aggression in pierre and desperately comic womanizing in the more recent bruno  unfortunately for auteuil fans the actor has become reliant on a uniform worldweariness not unlike compatriot johnny hallyday in lecontes recent lhomme du train acting it aint and becomes rather frustrating as the film progresses pascal bonitzer doesnt help as the writerdirector of the project his sequencing of episodes overlaid with connecting symbolism fail to mask the films lack of rhythm i was particularly furious that the imposingly dramaticromantic backdrops of grenoble were made virtually redundant by a cameraman who was obviously shivering in the cold  krisitn scott thomas almost rescues the show with her female counterpart to bruno beatrice she dramatizes the dizzying contradictions intended as bruno in a character of increasing complexity to the point of becoming surreal bonitzer cannot sustain this though and the flagging plot demands beatrice to even out into another bourgeois mannequin in doing so bonitzer shows then denies scott thomas the oscar cabinet  all the characters submersion into the bourgeoisie may be a viable and indeed tragic outcome but in this case its a copout of a cadence unlike the brutal painful denouement of la separation a serious disappointment 410,negative,0
okay ill admit that if i didnt have kids i never would have seen this film and would never see it but considering all the rotten kids movies i have seen such as spy kids 2 or babe pig in the city this is a significant improvement and it had enough in it that i wasnt totally bored out of my skull or contemplated suicide something i did repeatedly in the other two movies sure the performances are pretty broad and the plot is kinda sillybut it is a kids film and compared with other films in the genre this is definitely better than average frankie muniz and amanda bines actually appear to have some talent and probably will continue to have careers after pubertyat least on infomercials or doing voiceovers  so if you are looking for a film to see with your kids you certainly could do a lot worse,positive,1
i put this movie on not expecting much other than a b movie gore fest thankfully i was presented with a very well made film that built up the suspense and managed to maintain it throughout its run time this was an impressive achievement the acting was solid creating characters that you cared about and related to and although some may find the film slow it did force you to think about what you would have done in the same situation added to this there was some fine camera work and the directors pulled it all together admirably an excellent effort then that is well worth your time if you prefer development and suspense over gore,positive,1
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was  how it contained holes inconsistencies and  frankly  a whole lot of crap  and how horrid the dancing was i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic the character developments also lacked in depth i think that this was very much a product of the 80s the film does not hold up today,negative,0
in 1858 tolstoy wrote this in his diary the political is not compatible with the artistic because the former in order to prove has to be onesided this thought from a great mind is applicable to usa the movie the film might be read by those with a narrow focus as a 90 minute slam of bush cheney et al as well as a ripping of america as an outofcontrol imperialistic force that will ultimately be destroyed by its own folly and thirst for power the more openminded viewer will take note of the recurring images and themes that make this dvd a testament to postmodernist thought as the main character breaks up into bits and pieces surrounded by recurring visuals of the natural world contrasted with the manmade constructions towers roads video monitors radio vehicles above all the ominous threat of wars that have been and are to come smolder throughout war and rumors of war are what is created destroyed and recreated on the screen in our conscious world and in our unconscious minds,positive,1
i cant help but laugh at the people who praise this show as heartwarming and tearjerking for one its entirely unrealistic that these people will have perfect lives after their new homes  how can these families afford to maintain these new megahouses and what about their poor neighbors property taxes must surely increase after this happens plus the noise would annoy me  second how excessive can a reality television show become its practically the same repetitive junk week after week were introduced to a suffering family they renovate the home then surprise the family and everyone breaks out the kleenex boxes  not to mention how boring the renovation part is the only interesting part of the show is to see what the house looks like but even that segment is destroyed by the phony confessionals and constant sobbing  extreme makeover home edition is a show pretending to be heartfelt but it falls flat skip this one if you like reality television survivor is far superior and moving,negative,0
existenz combines director david cronenbergs traditional love of blood and gore and exploding heads with the more confusing aspects of a reality twisting david lynch film and it actually works effectively i wont bother trying to give even the bare bones of a plot synopsis here because itll only cause more confusion all you need to know is that the film is about a virtual reality computer game that is so incredibly lifelike that it becomes difficult to tell the difference between reality and virtual reality the film almost seems to abandon its technology fearing point at the end but then it throws in the final twist in the very last line of dialogue  theres also some very gross sexual imagery based around the bioports in the protagonists backs as well as some very gross acting from jude law he manages to come off as naive and stupid and boring and any other annoying habit you can care to think of jason jennifer leigh comes off much better and everyone else can be called a supporting character including willem dafoe in a functional if unspectacular role as a moneycrazed mechanic overall existenz is a very effective scifi film about the possibilities technology can present and the possible consequences it will receive,positive,1
if sicily is a territory of the baroque with its doubling of perspective thats part of this movies challenge to realism and its an exuberant pleasure here outdoing fellini with not one but three film directors plus of course the actual bellocchio who has made some really great movies and shouldnt be touchy about his honor there is a variety of takes and casting improvisations on manzonis i promessi sposi with somewhere there actual marriage sicily is also taken to be a territory of skulduggery you already know this version of the island so theres no spoiler involved a comic version of which makes the picture worth seeing for sergio castellitos work with guard dogs on the floor of the great hall of a palazzo,positive,1
this film is hard to knock it follows in the tradition of pulp fiction yet succeeds further by stamping its own unique style the cast is awesome the script is great  and things like the odd pulp fictionesque timesequencing is done brilliantly i particularly like how the images provided in flash back vary dramatically depending on who is telling the story at the time when it is one of the indoctrinated criminals everything is flashy and cool but when it is the heros recollection everything is skanky and disgusting  this is an awesome film  and so i am extremely annoyed to find that i cant buy it anywhere,positive,1
death lends a hand is one of the pivotal early episodes of columbo that helped define the show for the next thirty years it marks the first of robert culps four appearances three as a murderer playing much the same role in each show  in this case culp plays brimmer the head of a large private detective company who is asked to investigate whether the wife of a wealthy newspaper magnate mr kennicut is having an affair although she is brimmer decides not to tell kennicut in the hope that he can blackmail his wife in return for snippets of information about her husbands business associates she reacts badly to this suggestion an argument ensues which rapidly turns violent as brimmer whacks her across the face because he is wearing a large ring the blow knocks her to the ground and kills her  there are some really priceless moments in this episode one of my favourite scenes is where columbo pretends to be into palmreading although this is in fact a ruse to discover the shape and size of brimmers ring without admitting that he knows the killer wore a ring columbo being columbo he only reveals what he really knows when the time is exactly right to turn the screws a little so initially he goofily plays the part of a rather simpleminded man who gets excited by the lifeline going over the mound of the moon or some equally ridiculous palmreading mumbojumbo  another great scene is when brimmer tries to offer columbo a job for his firm effectively bribing him to stop poking his nose around again columbo doesnt reveal that he knows whats going on he pretends to be honoured and excited by this job offer  and theres another where columbo says to kennicut in front of brimmer that he wishes the murderer could hear their conversation he wants to hint to brimmer that he is onto him without directly accusing him so he rather cruelly but understandable in the circumstances decides to play mindgames on brimmer in order to spook him into panicking and doing something stupid which of course he does all the while the grieving kennicut is unaware of the subtext of this conversation its only near the end that columbo explains all to kennicut not shown on screen  i wont reveal how columbo finally nails the killer bang to rights but lets just say theres a potato involved   a really really good episode possibly the very best of the first series if you liked this then youll like double exposure too also featuring robert culp,positive,1
up until the last 20 minutes i was thinking that this is possibly jackie chans worst movie excluding his pre1978 work which i am not familiar with the final fight sequence changed all that it is long and good and intense  indeed one of the highlights of chans career but to get to it you have to sit through a lot of comedy that might amuse fiveyearolds oh look someone threw a tomato at that guys face and endless football scenes not to mention the dubbing which includes the line how can i turn it off its not a tap  watch to find out what it refers to dragon lord is worth renting for the final fight alone but the rest of the movie is only for jackie collectors and even then only for those whove already seen at least 15 of his other movies ,negative,0
well i just discovered that there is a show more disgusting and shocking than little britain and i like it the league of gentlemen is a sick british comedy that is about the most awful insane and disgusting small town in all the uk this place makes dibley and craggy island from the vicar of dibley and father ted seem pretty normal the format of the show is a lot like little britain except that all of it centers around the townspeople of this one hellish town both shows feature the same skits again and again every episode and some obviously inspired little britain particularly the job seeking class skit but the show differs because although it is crude like little britain hence not a show for kids the show has a sick and sadistic quality that sets it apart from all these shows in particular animal cruelty and serial killing are recurring themes throughout the show  now if you havent guessed this is not a show for kids the easily offended or normal people and thats probably why i liked it however you really do need very thick skin and a love of the awful to enjoy this to the max funny and incredibly irreverent beyond beliefyou have to see it to believe it,positive,1
the russian movie 4 follows the lives of three not four strangers who meet one night in a local bar one is a musician one a frozen meat seller and one a call girl  4 i gather is intended to showcase the dreariness and hopelessness of life in postsoviet russia the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are but the movie is so incoherent and boring that i seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it there seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes  operating secret cloning facilities selling decadesold frozen meat etc  but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that i doubt anyone could figure out what anybodys really up to here  despite decent acting and a few incisively directed scenes 4 is a twohour long endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs,negative,0
although the movie was only so so the closed captioning was by far the best i have ever seen most of the time the spelling is terrible and the captioning out of sync i use the closed captioning even though i can hear well but find a lot of actors mumble also many times the sound track overrides the dialogue thanks,negative,0
i saw rachels attic thinking that i would be in for an enjoyably visceral ride however it was not to be the case visceral yes but enjoyable that would be a big fat no in fact the only reason that i gave it a 3 is due to the fact that gunnar hansen appears ever so briefly as one of the films reprehensible characters how they ever lured mr hansen into this piece ofwork ill never know the story idea is interesting but poorly executed the direction is pedestrian and the acting is mediocre the only thing that is worse than that are the special effects yikes ive seen better effects in a grade school play give it up mr w its time for a career changei hear theyre hiring at mels diner there are very few well made inde movies coming out of michiganand rachels attic isnt one of them,negative,0
before seeing this i was put off by the subject matter but this is not your average triumph over adversity story although this is technically about blind tibetan kids climbing mt everest there is so much more to it this movie shows the very strong often contradictory personalities of two highly accomplished blind adults leading the children erik and sabriye erik is an american blind mountain climberathlete and sabriye is a blind german academic who started a school in lhasa tibet they are both exceptional in their own ways but disagree on what will really build confidence in the kids erik wants them to reach the summit while sabriye wants them to enjoy erik as a role model and take pleasure in moment the nuances are complicated and one walks away not really being sure who was right or if the whole climb was a mistake or a great idea the most profound scenes are with the tibetan children themselves and the hardships they faced before finding their way to the school the most moving for me was the story of tashi a frail teenager who grew up on the streets after his parents abandoned him i could watch a whole movie on his life and was happy to learn that thanks to the school he is now running a successful small business with some of his fellow students if you liked spellbound or murderball you will love this,positive,1
mel brooks is a great writerdirector and actor but once in a while even he can have a klinker the beginning of this starts out almost basically just meeting one character after anotheryou have cary elwes whos charming and talented but he cant do comedy his expressions into the camera show that even he cant believe the inanities in the script richard lewis looks bored and distracted throughout without much to do and amy yasbeck is stuck in highschool acting mode dave chapelle shows great comedy range mugging and hamming for the camera and mark blankfield is mostly stifled in the role of the blind man but then he does still manage to show great comedy range eric allen kramer doesnt have much to do but the few scenes he does have are binding the best roles are those of roger rees tracy ullman megan cavanaugh and brooks for when he does appear dom deluise has a funny turn as a mafia don employing a clint eastwood lookalike but on the minus side some of the jokes arent very funny while some of the really funny ones seem stolen from mels other movies,positive,1
this movie is best described or compare to big fish the movie by tim burton but its a less glamorous and more in you face tale and of course here its not the father but his grandfather who tells the stories  the movies narrative also moves back and forth so the story outline here at imdb might tell you more than you would like to read before watching the movie its funny and engaging enough even though you get from one story to another and have some dramatic moments too it also surprises you here and there with things you wouldnt expect a nice little movie then that deserves your attention especially if you like movies like that o,positive,1
i was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in productionbut it turned out to be the the biggest let down a far cry from the whimsical world of dr seuss it was vulgar and distasteful i dont think dr seuss would have approvedhow the grinch stole christmas was much better i understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on whereas the cat in the hat screamed vulgarity they caught a lot more than i would have likedgrowing up with dr seuss it really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got trashed on the big screen lets see what they do with horton hears a whoi hope this one does dr seuss some justice,negative,0
for those expecting the cover art and story outline to indicate another entertaining bollywood indian production beware no musical dance numbers or songs of production value exist to brighten the mood in this rather tired story of arranged marriages in the british indian culture  with a few variations thrown in as written by roopesh parekh the script jumps around topics worthy of discussion only to cover them up with routine avoidance tactics harmage singh kalirai directs like a traffic cop trying to hold together the disparate subplots to the point of keystone cop tactics  jimi chris bisson is a medical school student who is gay and has a lover jack peter ash and they live with jacks obese alcoholic loose morals aunt vanessa sally bankes and sallys chubby daughter hannah katy clayton jimis family is visited by the patel family from delhi who bring their beautiful daughter simran jinder mahal to england to find a husband jimis parents saeed jaffrey and jamila massey and his grandmother zohra sehgal decide simran is the girl for jimi to marry and arrange an engagement and wedding in the custom of indian ways  without consulting jimi jimi discovers the plot and is too spineless not to go along with it a decision which enrages jack and infuriates vanessa hannah tells a little lie to simran that she is jimis daughter and the wedding is off when jimis parents visit jimis house they discover the drunken vanessa are repulsed by her but eventually decide that for jimis happiness they will go along with the fact that vanessa has given them a granddaughter and decide to use the marriage preparations as a wedding for jimi and vanessa jimi convinces the very reluctant vanessa to go along with the idea and before long vanessa is dressed in a sari prepared for a wedding and jimi terrified at what he is doing just to please his parents includes jack as his best man at the wedding the truth comes out and to jimis surprise his family adapts to jimis true self and the day is saved by simply being truthful  the cast copes with this silly bit of nonsense rather well and there are some good performances chris bisson and peter ash are attractive men and play their roles well albeit without any indication at all of a loving relationship the director seems terrified of showing the least suggestion of intimacy between the two men sally bankes provides most of the laughs as vanessa the rest of the cast repeat the stereotype roles theyve played countless times in indian movies this is not a bad film  it has its moments  but it is just too superficial and tired to make us care about any of the characters,negative,0
documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and by the process their own lives are not that uncommon also not uncommon are results that reflect lack of talent a failure of introspection an abundance of narcissism and perhaps an unsubtle quest for publiclysplashed revenge for countless past hurts real and fantasized what is unusual is a brilliant fair and engrossing portrait of a fascinating parent and my architect a sons journey is that rare achievement  louis kahn emigrated to this country as a child his face irreparably and brutally scarred by an accident he and his parents settled in philadelphia where the talented youngster loved art and music soon he became enamored of buildings and decided only an architects career would answer his creative abilities  kahn became an architect but as this film shows it took a long time before he attracted the attention of the leaders in his field one architect suggests that he was a victim of the yellow armband that antisemitism that along with bias against women was long a disreputable aspect of the american profession of architecture  when he did achieve notice he was seen clearly accurately as a selfassured workaholic prophet exclaiming unyielding demands that his vision and only his vision be realized that inflexibility was the reason that while he drew wonderful plans for many buildings he built but a few the interview with an aged gentleman who fired kahn in philadelphia because of his unacceptable dream of a transformed urban center where people left their cars on the perimeter and walked into the city is hilarious  kahn was a born teacher and some of the extensive archival footage here shows him with students his voice steady but passionate their gazes respectful and intense  many architects were interviewed by director writer and project honcho nathaniel kahn the architects only son some are world famous  i m pei robert am stone moshe safdie frank gehry and the still active nonagenarian philip johnson their comments paint a vivid picture of this idealistic but in the end financially unsuccessful designer of buildings that blended the castles fortresses and grand buildings of past centuries into designs for the present kahns buildings are shown among the most impressive being the salk research laboratories in la jolla ca to me his style has a neoromantic air deadened by too much blank space that repels rather than attracts human interaction  but kahns son was after more than the story of his father the architect for many years louis kahn had three families a wife with whom he had a daughter and two longterm relationships one of which produced a daughter the other the son kahn visited his son at the mothers home often but at the end of an evening mother and son would drive kahn back to the marital home nathaniel clearly wanted to know about this unusual set of relationships but he doesnt appear to be scarred by what was certainly a strange affair for a little boy   when nathaniel was a young boy louis kahn died of a massive heart attack in the mens room of new yorks pennsylvania station after returning from india where he had pitched one of his massive projects another one that was never built at that point his philadelphia firm was at least 500000 in debt and had he lived a trip to the federal bankruptcy court was probably in the offing  kahn left several monumental structures of which the government building in bangladesh is clearly the biggest a teary local architect hails kahn for having created a building where democracy may and hopefully will flourish  fellow architect moshe safdie opines that there might have been something fitting in kahns suffering a mortal heart attack in a train station given his incessant globetrotting i disagree its sadly ironic that kahn should die in the faceless replacement for one of americas true architectural gems the old pennsylvania station wrecked to make way for a sterile replacement with no character and no continuation of civic memory  there are a number of emotional moments filmed during the younger kahns journey including with his halfsisters and his mother but theyre genuine and moving not maudlin and staged historians of architecture will always study kahn his son found reasons to remember him as a flawed but very iconoclastic and ultimately private man  910,positive,1
despite gorgeous and breathtaking animation this is probably one of most uninspiring disney films ive seen and i dont slam disney films very often spirit is a wild stallion who repeatedly gets captured either by the cavalry or by indians both of which try to break him spirit ends up forming a bond with the indian and that in a nutshell is the story with exception to the beautiful animation of the horses neither i or my five year old were very inspired or excited by this film its ironic that its titled spirit as spirit is what this film could have used a bit more of an extra point was given for the soundtrack which was enjoyable with songs by bryan adams and hans zimmer and although this film is rated g you will still probably have to end up explaining what breaking a horse means to your five year old i did  ,positive,1
this was one of the first color films i have seen at the cinema when i was a child it is good to remember it the girl liz taylor who later became a beautiful woman starred together with the tiny and excellent actor mickey rooney the content of the film plot is good for all ages good wills and behavior good ethics of velvets parents particularly her mother is something to take into account our generations should be well educated and this film may help to this purpose velvet loves the horses and racing them and mi taylor rooney brought her to an international horse racing competition in england where at the end the young velvet won but was disqualified because of being female,positive,1
i am speechless honestly i cannot understand how anyone could have conceded to a script like this cast anyone in the film let alone direct it the fact that i am writing this review feels like an insult to my fingers this film should be thrown in to the dustbin rather than be reviewed i am disappointed in flex alexander for even thinking about accepting such a poor excuse for a script let alone essay the role omg i think i just insulted the word essayuh yeah i did yknow what the less said about this mindless drivel the better you have been warned nobody warned me i had to experience the horror myself watch at your own risk,negative,0
early in the movie cagneys johnny cave character tells his gumshoes in the office of weights and measures that in the previous year unscrupulous shop owners had cheated the american consumer out of more money than the aggregate national war debt then he goes out and tickets a particularly greasy green grocer for shortselling him a bag of sugar that is four ounces off oh the horrors and one skinny chicken that his butchers scale has rather generously proclaimed to be six lbs after which the furor in this case feathersflies er fly when a racketeer in politicians clothing attempts to derail an investigation into the paltry poultry purveyors practices our hero becomes a lone wolf waging the war of the weights on behalf of housewives across america after all four cents here and a quarter there add up and before we know it we have anarchy word of his intransigence soon reaches both the mayor and the governors offices and cagney becomes a marked man if it sounds silly its notthe dishonest retailing practices are only a plot tool or as hitchcock would say the mcguffin and while unfamiliar it works every bit as well here as any treasury agent or gman anthology in which the fight is taken to shady crooks who are operating outside the interests of the countrys common good the production standards are decidedly gradeb but it is cagney who makes this movie the delight that it is this was his first film away from warner brothers after seeking release in court from his unreasonable contract and he seems to be at ease and enjoying himself tremendouslythe performance turned in here is intelligent and crackles with his unique energy and surefire charisma mae clarkes presence lends a definite warners feel to the overall production the supporting players turn in solid performances and the story moves along smartly after a rocky introduction that seems to begin three or four reels into the storybut sit back and enjoy it for the cagney showcase and engaging depressionera time capsule that it is,positive,1
a montage prologue quite obviously manufactured by the blessed maniacs who actually chose to distribute this thing tries to convince us that the comic impact of this staggeringly incompetent bit of nothing is entirely deliberate dont you believe it this is to lloyd kaufman as andy warhol is to herschel gordon lewis it is so thoroughgoing in its project of torturing its hypothetical audience that it seems like some kind of misanthropic negationist art installation only it cant be because it is so completely bereft of selfconsciousness as obnoxious and ugly as things or frozen scream this manages to up the ante by recycling itself with a maddeningly bald insistence that has to be seen to be believed a hitchcockstyle shotbyshot analysis of say the attack on the cardio girls might yield twenty edits and perhaps three minutes of footage  only the sequence is ten minutes long you want to believe that this started life as a slightly more bearable short subject except if you took away the repetition whats left would be far less fascinating eg when the fiend does enter the room he only inspires extended highly apathetic utterly blank stares from his imminent offscreen victims repeat this scenario about four times in marginally varied settings bridge these with perhaps thirty lines of dialogue total offer up actors even more hateful and lethargic than those in the above mentioned classics and grace us with a monster comprising gauze ketchup and one yellow spock ear and youve got a movie too mindboggling to refuse a working definition of bad im proud to own it,negative,0
spoilers like other posters i felt that the ending was a bit abrupt i would have liked to have seen the crew adjusting to life back on earth after their return i suppose the writers anticipated this problem by front loading some voyager on earth sequences at the beginning of the episode of course that time line has been eradicated so its all moot i did like how admiral janeway died for the voyager crew as fans we get to have our cake and eat it to by having janeway both make the ultimate sacrifice and live on i admit that the scenes of janeway and her older self having conversations was bizarre and so easily could have crossed the line into camp fortunately mulgrews pulled it off,positive,1
like most people i was interested in more solely because of the pink floyd soundtrack which has turned out to be the only pink floyd album that i still listen to after all these years it was quite a surprise to run across the film in a local video store in a digitally remastered version it was an even bigger surprise to find that it is a pretty good movie  visually it is quite beautiful especially when the two main characters are cavorting on the rocks on the spanish island of ibiza and the use of the soundtrack music which as far as i can tell is exclusively by pink floyd is excellent it was a joy to watch the film with my copy of the album alongside me mentally ticking off each track as it was used in the film dave gilmours brief a spanish piece was the only one i didnt hear and several tracks are used quite prominently especially cymbaline main theme and quicksilver that latter track is tedious on the soundtrack album but works very well during the title sequence of the film resurfacing at least once later on maybe now i can appreciate it on the album now that i have some visuals to accompany it in my mind  the plot of more is a little hard to take at times especially in the early going when the film appears to be merely a vehicle to demonstrate the hipness of those involved in making it but eventually the film proves that it has much more than that to offer as the plot becomes more focused why does stefan take heroin why does anybody take heroin fully knowing the possible consequences the film does not attempt to answer that question directly but stefans heroin use seems a logical extension of his singleminded pursuit of pure pleasure  i strongly recommend this film to any pink floyd fan who has an appreciation of the vastly underrated more soundtrack i also recommend it to anyone who has an interest in sixties counterculture and how it was portrayed in the media i have no idea how realistic this movie is since i am too young to have experienced the sixties firsthand but it does seem to capture the spirit of the times in a way that no other movie does,positive,1
one of the commenters is wrong this is not the only pat patterson film and he didnt die two years after this was made he shot a film called the electric chair in pineville nc he shot this a few years after doctor gore patterson died in the late 70s i know this because he used my house and he left a cat there it sucked also this was a big deal when the movie came out no independent horror films were being made in nc this movie didnt help matters patterson used to do gore effects for h g lewis he was also good at magic his gore scenes in body shop were actually well done the film was shot in a building that also housed a 711 you can actually see the tops of the walls in some scenes the budget was less that 20000 and the script looked like a child wrote it only patterson could understand it stillits entertainment and its a classic,negative,0
the premise of an africanamerican female scrooge in the modern struggling city was inspired but nothing else in this film is here ms scrooge is a miserly banker who takes advantage of the employees and customers in the largely poor and black neighborhood it inhabits there is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved part of the problem is that storys roots dont translate well into the urban setting of this film and the script fails to make the update work also the constant message about sharing and giving is repeated so endlessly the audience becomes tired of it well before the movie reaches its familiar end this is a message film that doesnt know when to quit in the title role the talented cicely tyson gives an overly uptight performance and at times lines are difficult to understand the charles dickens novel has been adapted so many times its a struggle to adapt it in a way that makes it fresh and relevant in spite of its very relevant message,negative,0

when you put this dvd into your player and hit play you will experience a brief moment of silence and see a black screen as the laser is guided to the correct starting point in the center of the disc cherish this moment make sure you have some tylenol or something preferably pms so you can fall asleep because youre going to have a massive headache once this movie starts  starring a bunch of bigbreasted girls and with an opening that actually made me chuckle a bit i thought id be in for a good time sure the opening sequence was a wee bit awkward and most of the jokes fell flat and it seemed like this was going to be a scream ripoff by the way my sole chuckle was from julie strains final comment in this scene but then i knew there was trouble the opening sequence had a terrible rock song during this terrible rock song i looked over the dvd chapter titles and saw things that said topless in the backyard and better than sex i knew what the selling point of this movie was going to be  and thats the sad truth the only good thing about this movie is the attractive cast other than that its a sadly routine slasher film that throws in an innovative concept about murder clubs which ends up being fake anyway so the whole movie then points in another direction to try to be confusing and this huge mystery but it all just adds up to not being interesting at all and leaves you feeling like you dont care for any of the characters i mean when the main character of the movie is revealed to have murdered an innocent woman can you really feel any sympathy towards her when shes in fear for her life the scream influence is prevalent throughout with a ghost face killer and some really terrible jokes were also treated to scenes of the main character talking to her mom and dad lloyd kaufman the only other cool part of the movie about an abortion or something uh yeah this isnt a sobaditsgood movie its just bad  someone compared this to a troma film but you know most any film that comes from full moon or its offshoot as this film proves is horrible not horrible in a troma sense  ive seen many troma films and i can honestly say they all offer something anything that you can walk away with and tell your friends about later however this film has pretty much nothing at all enjoyable about it beware,negative,0
i dont understand the many good reviews here i found the photography and scenery beautiful and the two lead actors appealing but theres little else here to recommend this movie most annoying are the fake southern accents and badly written dialog these do not sound like real people to me although its refreshing to show men exploring various forms of sexuality without the usual labeling and stereotypical character traits most of the story is without motivation or logic the only thing that makes very much sense is the responsibility griffith feels toward his mentally ill aunt grossly overacted by karen black lee is an interesting character who would have been more compelling had the dialog he was made to speak been more natural and his motivations more clear yes i understand that hes a drifter but his actions as the movie draws to a rushed conclusion make no sense at all this movie is worth a look chiefly because it has a nice atmosphere about it but its slow moving and deeply flawed a serious rewrite and better editing might have saved it as the premise and story outline are promising,negative,0
i always feel strange and guilty saying it because im a fairly welleducated nonteenager but i actually sort of like the olsen twins and i respect the movies they make even though ive never really been their target audience when in rome was a traditional marykate and ashley movie complete with the foreign travel accents motorbikes adult romance as a b storyline fashion orientation and even the gag reel over the credits i enjoyed myself when in rome and the other olsen twin movies never pretend to be anything theyre not most of the time they only premiere on video and they never claim to be the next citizen kane or even an affair to remember my point is people who watch this movie and expect it to be anything other than another olsen twin movie will be disappointed  that said those who are fans of the olsen twins will really enjoy themselves for those of us whove watched them since the first episodes of full house its really great to see them growing into more mature roles this movie provides important historical and geographical information just like many of their other movies remember 10 downing street from winning london and the visit to the louvre from passport to paris as well as providing good clean fun that can be enjoyed by the whole family  as long as i still feel like im on my soapbox and as long as i can make it relevant to the movie let me take a moment to challenge those who reject the olsen twins in order to be a fan of the olsen twins you dont have to be some preteen valley girl from california in fact thats not really the target audience if it were the mka fashion line of clothes and accessories would be run through gap or some store like that not walmart when in rome while it does feature high fashion and globetrotting and two girls from a valley in cali isnt really about that its more about inspiring young girls who have initiative to let it take them places if that means setting the movie in some glamorous foreign city with cute guys on motorbikes so be it thats called marketingyou take an idea and sell it by making it appealing at least theyre sending a good message even if the means seem a little superficial   basically dont knock the film until youve seen it and then dont knock it until youve tried to understand what the olsen twins do they encourage young girls to be creative intuitive and driven young women this movie does that i think just like their others kids  enjoy parents  do the same if you like the olsen twins you wont be disappointed,positive,1
what the bleep do we know is a deluded and haphazard look at the mysteries of the universe we are presented with a parade of apparent experts none of whom are named who ramble and pontificate in a thoroughly unscientific manner their interviews are chopped up into aggravatingly small segments and dispersed throughout some flashy cgi and banal miniplots  the film pilfers themes from science philosophy theology and politics minces them together without any regard for accuracy and then somehow extracts a few prosaic and absurd conclusions we are led to believe that quantum physics is telling us the purpose of our existence and any other difficult to answer question the filmmakers would like to point their finger at  it is riddled errors and logical nonsequiturs how did we start at quantum mechanics and end up with this pseudoscientific spirituality and mysticism its like saying two plus two equals four therefore i can move objects with my mind  there is nothing original in this film and almost nothing that is accurate any discriminating viewer will be annoyed by heavyhanded editing intrusive and pointless special effects and general lack of substance educated viewers will be frustrated to tears by the violence done to science and every other subject this film touches on,negative,0
you know sometimes you just gotta have it thats how this movie is with me i am almost embarrassed to admit that i like it it is so goofy in some parts but i find myself reaching for it when im down and just need a good laughand trust me i am just not a goofy movie kinda guy  you can read the synopsis so i dont have to bore you with that just rest assured if you like kelsey grammer you will probably like this movie  one more thing be sure to watch the end credits you dont need to read them just watch them and catch the performance of in the navy by the village peopleand friends,positive,1
mean spirited and down right degrading adaptation to the classic childrens tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever mike myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what jim carrey did but he should give up acting all together he is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film the sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor i have seen a lot of bad film this year but this not only takes the cake but it is with out a doubt one the worse films ever made,negative,0
i love science fiction i am fascinated by egyptian mythology and i appreciate digital animation i figured a movie that combines these three would be at least enjoyable i could not have been more wrong the story or actually the lack there of was completely uninspired and lacks imagination  while imagination usually is the biggest component of any science fiction story the dialogue and acting are even worse than in an average porno movie especially thomas kretschmann gives new meaning to the term bad performance bad acting wouldnt have been such a huge problem if only director bilal didnt take himself so seriously all the lines sound like they are supposed to be poetic it looks like bilal really thinks he has made a piece of art here well theres no art or poetry to be found in this piece of junk only pretentiousness this man should really stick to making comics since he fails on all possible accounts as a director worst of all is the terrible digital animation which is so ugly that it actually turns watching this movie into a physically painful experience the graphics look so fake they even make the werewolves in van helsing look like live actors and since half the characters are cgianimated it is quite a problem that the cgieffects look so fake if the egyptian gods actually exist then bilals a dead guy since they will no doubt take gruesome revenge on him for the ridiculous way in which he portrays them in this disastrously bad movie,negative,0
whilst it is universally acknowledged that fearful symmetry was heavily influenced by the kolchak episode they have been they are they will be whether this makes it a ripoff or a homage is an altogether more controversial point as a huge fan of both series i subscribe to the latter belief although the less charitable may not do james whitmore was brave to take on the task of directing such a difficult episode invisible elephants and gorilla suits sounds like a recipe for disaster but he pulls it off with style the teaser being an absolute gem lance guest does a great job of making a credible character out of kyle lang and jack rader seethes with menace as ed meecham forget fearful symmetrys dubious originality and just enjoy it as a deeply satisfying x file,positive,1
even though this movie is quite old no matter how many times i watch it it still makes me laugh   one particular quote in the movie stands out   when danny joe piscopo pulls up to the das office  parks in a disabled spot dannys partner says    cant park here its for the handicapped   danny replies  i am handicappedim psychotic  that is one of the many lines in the movie that no matter how many times you watch itll make you chuckle  johnny dangerously stands in my top 5 comedyspoof movies of all time  as an added bonus it also includes the legendary actor peter boyle in the cast so watch this movie  like myself  many others who have watched it youll be hooked,positive,1
i am sorry to say that it was one of the worst films ive ever seen although visually fascinating eg the use of colour was absolutely stunning it was pretty boring and disturbing see the fatherson incest  whats more music is totally absent and if you think of those wonderful soundtracks by michael nyman who wrote the soundtracks for most of greenaways films then you can imagine what a difference it makes  ,negative,0
this movie fully deserves to be one of the top hindi comedies ever made  rajkumar santoshi is mostly known for his gritty hardhitting social dramas  but this is easily the most effortless movie he has made   the plot revolves around two smalltown buffoons amar aamir khan and prem salman khan  they want to get rich quick and so move to the big city  they hatch the same plan separately  to woo a rich heiress raveena raveena tandon who is the daughter of a rich businessman ramgopal bajaj paresh rawal  thus the one who marries raveena gets his hands on all her wealth  but when they get to know each others plan  there is an intense tussle of oneoneupmanship over who marries raveena  hilarious gags and situations ensue as the battle rages on   at the same time ramgopal bajajs identical twin brother shyamgopal bajaj wants to eliminate his brother and niece and usurp the family fortune  add to this an assortment of funny characters including a raveenas maid karishma karishma kapoor  a mistakeprone butler named robert vijoo khote  a manager named bhalla shehzad khan who mimics yesteryears villain ajeet and a funny gangster gogo shakti kapoor who looks more like a pirate and a rollicking comedy awaits you   do not waste your time looking for logic in the movie  leave the company of your brains and just enjoy  the actors are so much in sync with the script that no room is left for mistakes  dialogues rajkumar santoshi  dilip shukla are witty  music tushar bhatia and lyrics majrooh sultanpuri are memorable  the picturization and choreography saroj khan of yeh raat aur yeh doori  ae lo ji sanam and dil karta hai tere paas aaoon is fitting and will remain etched in my mind forever   the film starred two superstarsinthemaking  aamir khan and salman khan they eventually became superstars  aamir khan is impeccable in his first allout comedy role  i salute his sense of comic timing  salman pales in comparison with aamir but is still likable  among the supporting characters  paresh rawal stands out in his dual role of ramgopal and shyamgopal   the movie surprisingly failed at the box office  i fail to understand why  i recommend it to all nevertheless ,positive,1
a man by the name of joseph samuels is found brutally murdered in his apartment it would appear that samuels was visited by a group of drunken soldiers the previous evening and with one of them seemingly missing the evidence certainly implicates the missing soldier but as detective finlay digs deeper into the case he finds that they could be barking up the wrong tree and that this crime is dealing with something desperately sad and vile antisemitism  crossfire was born out of the novel written by richard brooks adapted by john paxton and directed by the shrewdly excellent edward dmtryk crossfire originaly titled cradle of fear is a taut and gripping picture that boldly tackles antisemitism tho the makers were forced to tone down the story from the original source the novel is about homosexual hatred as opposed to antisemitism what remains largely due to rko supremo dore schary and producer adrian scott is a sort of creeping unease that drips with noirish style  the cast features three bobs young mitchum and ryan with noir darling gloria grahame adding the emotional female heart tho only third billed its robert ryans picture all the way his portrayal as the bullying conniving montgomery is from the top draw and perfectly showcases the talent that he had in abundance ryan had good cause to give montgomery some of is best work for he had served in the marines with richard brooks himself both men having discussed the possibility that if the novel was to be made into a film then ryan wanted in and to play montgomery thus the genesis of ryans career as weasel types was born gloria grahame also puts in a wonderful and heartfelt turn which is all the more remarkable since she was being plagued by her abusive husband at the time stanley clements was known to be violent towards her and his constant presence around the set irked others in the cast but grahame probably channelling real life emotion became the character of ginny and shone very bright indeed both bob mitchum and bob young come out with flying colours as well to really seal the deal on what a smartly acted picture crossfire really is  tho crossfire was released before the other 1947 antisemitic picture gentlemans agreement and raking in over a million and a quarter dollars at the box office some of its thunder was stolen by the academy award winning picture from fox studio nominated for best picture best supporting actor ryan best supporting actress grahame best director and best screenplay it won nothing but critics of the time hailed it as a brilliant shift in american cinema and today it stands tall proud and dark as a bold and excellent piece of work 8510,positive,1
never before have the motives of the producers of a motion picture been more transparent lets see first they get every willing televangelist to hype this film as the greatest thing since sliced white bread next they encourage as many fundamentalist christians as possible to purchase copies of the film so as to recoup its paltry production costs and pump up its advertising budget and finally when the film hits the theaters get as many said christians as possible to see it yet again bus them into the multiplexes if necessary not on the merits of the film itself but because a 1 box office opening will be seen as some sort of profound spiritual victory  but that of course wont be enough i imagine that any film critic with the audacity to give left behind anything short of a glowing review will be deemed antichristian  of course this shamelessly manipulative marketing campaign shouldnt surprise anyone it is after all good old fashioned capitalism at work what does surprise me is how many people have been suckered into the whole left behind mindset as someone who tries to balance his spiritual beliefs with some sense of reason and rationality it leaves me scratching my head it would appear that there are many many people who actually believe that sometime in the near future a rapture is going to occur and that millions of people all over the earth are going to simultaneously vanish into thin air what kind of reality i wonder are these people living in is this rapture something they actually believe in or is it something they fervently want to believe in and when they reach the end of their lives and realize this rapture has not occurred will they be disappointed and disillusioned will there still be people 100 years from now insisting that the rapture is imminent  in a way i almost wish that such an event would occur what an interesting day that would be what would be even more interesting is if the apocalypse were to occur in a more spectacular fashion not in the anthropological sense the authors of the left behind series have portrayed but as more of a stephen spielberg production with boiling clouds trumpets angels descending out of the sky moon turned to blood the whole nine yards imagine coming to the realization that it was all coming true just as the evangelists had been warning for years and that there was something more awesome than just the cold hard physical reality we inhabit wouldnt that be something  yet in the final analysis its that cold hard physical reality that i will content myself with my life is not so meaningless that i need the fear of a rapture and the end times to make sense of it all  nor do i need heaven or hell to bribe or scare me into behaving decently thank you very much,negative,0
i watched this episode with high hopes after seeing it on so many peoples favourite episodes list im not boasting in any way but from the start i realised they were in some sort of toyboxcan with the huge eye looking down on them to the type of characters in there even though throughout the episode the questions of who are we where are we whats outside carry the suspense of the episode which i unfortunately already figured out i must say that different types of characters and the interaction between them did make the episode interesting enough although the twist of the story may have been harder to guess if all of them were toy soldiers,negative,0
for years i hesitated watching this movie now i know why not only is it a comedy that fails at being even remotely funny but theres also just nothing to laugh at about the movie it was even worse than id expected i rented this sucker and still felt cheated out of time more than money i have never seen a film that annoyed me that much it is a movie about stupid people that are doing stupid and terrible things i dont really know either how someone with common sense could actually act in this kind of movie i have used imdb for some time but felt obligated to register just to help prevent poor unsuspecting folks from renting or worse buying this stinker really a waste of time and money i must say that the plot line is awful,negative,0
people please dont bother to watch this movie this movie is bad its totally waste of time i dont see any point here its a stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor i rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again,negative,0
first off this really is my favorite film ever i dont need to give anyone a description because every ahole does that i am literally obsessed with this practically bloodless cheesy lame effects having boomstick showing badly edited 80s metal horror masterpiece the director i heard had hoped for a hit at the box office so that he could do sequels and have a freddyjason type of deal for himself damn i wish that couldve went down like that the soundtracks banging the actings goodcheck this mofo out and any diehard fans out there feel free to email and chat sometime midgetorgyi can be found at yahoo,positive,1
it was jon pertwee who said  its very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly   well if thats the case pasty faces is  very easy   david baker  as director screenwriter  and his cast seem to be under the impression that comedy involves stealing scenes and style from superior britcoms like lock stock and trainspotting  using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping up and down speaking in a very fast voice very loudly  alan mccaffrey especially suffers from this type of ott performance but not enough to ruin the film because theres not enough of a film to ruin   pasty faces is terrible on all fronts especially scriptwise  i couldnt understand why it ended the way it did  it just seemed to stop in a very abrupt and silly manner  oh and other glaring errors are that you need a visa to visit the usa and a green card in order to work there  this film would have you believe you can get off a plane and start a new life in america without any authorisation  that you still get paid to donate blood in america  people who i know in america  and who donate blood tell me payment for donations stopped several years ago  and that you can buy any type of weapon from a gun shop  as far as i know gun laws in america differ from state to state but no gun shops sell anti tank guns over the counter  so weve got a very erroneous view of america from a very unreal and oh so unfunny film  maybe this is revenge for braveheart a very hollywood view of the scots  perhaps  but this doesnt stop pasty faces from being a crap comedy,negative,0
being an austrian myself this has been a straight knock in my face fortunately i dont live nowhere near the place where this movie takes place but unfortunately it portrays everything that the rest of austria hates about viennese people or people close to that region and it is very easy to read that this is exactly the directors intention to let your head sink into your hands and say oh my god how can that be possible no not with me the in my opinion totally exaggerated uncensored swinger club scene is not necessary i watch porn sure but in this context i was rather disgusted than put in the right context  this movie tells a story about how misled people who suffer from lack of education or bad company try to survive and live in a world of redundancy and boring horizons a girl who is treated like a whore by her superjealous boyfriend and still keeps coming back a female teacher who discovers her masochism by putting the life of her supercruel lover on the line an old couple who has an almost mathematical daily cycle she is the official replacement of his ex wife a couple that has just divorced and has the ex husband suffer under the acts of his former wife obviously having a relationship with her masseuse and finally a crazy hitchhiker who asks her drivers the most unusual questions and stretches their nerves by just being superannoying  after having seen it you feel almost nothing youre not even shocked sad depressed or feel like doing anything maybe thats why i gave it 7 points it made me react in a way i never reacted before if thats good or bad is up to you,positive,1
first off anyone looking for meaningful outcome oriented cinema that packs some sort of social message with meaningful performances and soul searching dialog spoken by dedicated emotive heartfelt thespians please leave now you are wasting your time and life is short go see the new brangelina jolie movie have a good cry go out  buy a hybrid car or throw away your conflict diamonds if that will make you feel better and leave us alone  dont let the door hit you on the way out either the incredible melting man is a grade b minus regional horror epic shot in the wastelands of oklahoma by a young tv friendly cast  crew and concerns itself with an astronaut who is exposed to bizarre radiation effects wakes up in a hospital and finds that his body is liquefying on him as he sits there feeling like a chump the melting man is played by one alex rebar who is recognizable for about the first four minutes of the film but once he starts oozin with rick bakers extraordinary special effects makeup he more resembles something you might find in a tin of spam before you drain off all the runny viscous blebs of grease  the film has zero exposition and does not bandy about with plot points there are a couple of scenes involving scientist types riding around on an absurd industrial conveyor machine who dutifully recite a few obligatory lines about the effects of radiation but the movie does not care really its a freak show and a marvelous one at that with a decidedly sick sense of humor for those who can stomach it  one great laugh comes when the melting man stumbles upon a young girl in the forest and is so at a loss for what to do that one of his eyes pops out hilarious  the hero of the film is played by burr debenning a fascinating character actor from the golden 1970s  80s television scene who was sort of an early model for the kevin spacey prototype slightly twisted neurotic and one step ahead of most everyone in the room even if he looks confused he appeared just after this movie was made in a bizarre made for tv anthology horror piece called house of the dead or the alien zone that is regarded as one of the finest movies ever made in oklahoma which is where i suspect this film was made as well the arid cold looking rural midwestern landscapes are certainly the same and the creek that one unfortunate fly fisher chooses for his afternoon of sport appears to be the same one that cameron mitchell fought off flying alien pancakes in without warning  which also had a sick sense of humor a tv friendly cast and some pretty outrageous gore i definitely sense at least an aesthetic connection between the three movies as well as the silence of the lambs which is of no surprise considering that director jonathan demme is a part of melting mans cast  essentially as others have pointed out this is a 1950s b movie plot updated for later 1970s era special effects  the inevitable boobs the movie it probably borrows most of its ideas from is phantom from space with peter graves as an astronaut who also returns to earth after being exposed to funky radiation effects that set him off on a killing spree one of the things that i actually admire about the film is that absolutely no regard is given for the melting mans motivations he simply goes on a rampage and the movies drama comes from wondering if hes going to fall to pieces before certain characters fall victim to his madness the budget for the film is also delightfully low and every dime spent on it is up there on the screen rick bakers disgusting effects getting the lions share of whatever was spent on this  sick disgusting fun best enjoyed with a crowd of friends and plenty of beer why cant people have made more movies like these   810,positive,1
  very dull laborious adaptation of amiss amusing satire the hero is portrayed not as a likeable loser but a merely oafish cretin most of the rest are pure caricatures with only helen mccrory putting in real quality and providing something of the novels wit the period setting is camped up as if it were the 1920s not the postwar period of horror comics and rockn roll a real dud even by the standards of bad uk tv  ,negative,0
while the twilight zone was a wonderful show it was also very unevenwith some great episodes some lousy ones and many in between dont believe the diehard fansthere were some stinkers and this was definitely one of them  in a plot that is obviously meant to be an attack on fidel castro a near lookalike peter falk in lots of makeup and a beard obtains a magic mirror that allows him to realize who all his enemies are so he can liquidate them while i do believe that castro is a thug and dictator and tens of thousands of refugees and political prisoners will attest to this its amazing how this sort of preachy episode actually makes audiences laugh at the american efforts to marginalize the creep and actually makes castro seem okay think about itserling and company wanted to hurt castro but instead only seemed to be obvious preachy and silly in the process  its indeed badalmost laughably bad when seen today,negative,0
somerset maughams characters are brought to life in rkos of human bondage but the movie is a too skeletal version of the novel with bette davis starmaking performance sucking up all of the energy otherwise its the story of leslie howard as philip carey he dreams of becoming a painter but is told he has no talent for the arts as the film progresses mr howards struggles instead to become a doctor his efforts seem to indicate some bad advice regarding the arts though successful in medicine his painting seemed easier  also note the symbolism of his disability a club foot explained in the film  along the way right away in this version howard becomes infatuated with waitress davis as mildred rogers davis characterization of mildred is extraordinary culminating in a spectacular speech when she tells howard among other things that she had to wipe my mouth after kissing him howard also performs well but the story fails to explain his prolonged fascination and love for davis so their performances are wasted   still a film to watch for the acting including some good supporting players bette davis characterization was famous for inspiring a writein campaign for the 1934 best actress academy award for the record she placed third the results were   1 claudette colbert  it happened one night   2 norma shearer  the barretts of wimpole street   3 bette davis  of human bondage   4 grace moore  one night of love    of human bondage 62834 john cromwell  leslie howard bette davis reginald denny,positive,1
there is something special about the austrian movies not only by seidl but by spielmann and other directors as well this is the piercing sense of reality that never leaves the viewer throughout the movie hundstage is no exception this effect is achieved not only by the depicted stories but also by actors playing in hundstage i have never had the feeling that these are actors playing but real people instead so real is the visceral feeling of the vieweralmost as if the grumpy pensioner or lonely lady in the movie are living below you in your block  any person living in vienna can without any doubt painfully recognize the people in the movie with their meckernsudern complaining their hidden sexual urges and the prolo macho guys this is further reinforced by the viennese dialect which is according to many especially made for complaining as a way of life a special parochialism and arrogance typical for vienna are also very well portrayed  the viennese suburbs have a vivid presence in the movie with their stupor and drowsiness where nothing happens moreover they have been turned into a celebration of materialism with shopping malls and huge department stores inbetween are the houses of the people where they indulge into what they reckon is pleasuregiving activities trying to stay in touch with their human selves yet in vain the examples are the sexual game of the old lady with the men which bordered on rape the prolo guy losing his nerves and hitting his girlfriend and the young woman who hitchhikes and irritates her drivers  the film has no soundtrack as it concentrates on the normalityabnormality of its images only another typical feature of seidl and other austrian directors is his showing of disturbingly sexual images these include the stripping of the old woman for her husband the sexual scenes in the bath the sexual game of the lady with the two men in her apartment etc  in hundstage seild has portrayed the lives of people who eventually may be as much viennese as they could be citizens of paris new york or madrid the viewers should not despise or feel pity for the viennese in the movie as they themselves could become victims of the same human estrangement and alienation albeit in different circumstances in the end i believe seidls film is a warning to us about the terrible state of human relationships so brutally revealed in hundstage and if the viewer does not succumb to the reasons for this evil transformation seidl has achieved his goal,positive,1
certain filmmakers can do no wrong in the eyes of national critics which is one reason you should never pay attention to them this film is a perfect example the critics like director eric rohmer  this movie is a boring soap opera about a woman and a teenager pauline shes taking care of for the summer and the relationships they have with a few men its talk talk talk and more talk   for those looking at the cover and hoping to be titillated there are a few quick nude shots and a couple of swear words but otherwise this is a harmless french morality play a friend of mine loaned me this tape he thought he was getting some sexy french film and was disappointed i was just as disappointed because it also was so boring   how this gets such great reviews is almost unfathomable,negative,0
first of all i think the casting and acting were excellent the problem is the story there is basically no story here worth telling and thus basically no movie here larry mcmurtry has done lonesome dove and i cant fault the original though it probably didnt need sequels he did hud with paul newman which is one of my favorite movies mellencamp is supposed to be a country singer but the only song i hear him sing is an old buck owens song the movie makes a big deal out of chicken farming mellencamps character has a good wife and its utterly stupid of him to stray from her the incident with riding in the sliding cage is utterly stupid maybe people do that for fun in some parts of the country but i never heard of it,negative,0

i saw this film when it premiered in la i think i laughed 2 or three times the rest of the time i was in shock at how ridiculouspoorly shot and poorly written it was kirby is in fact the only saving grace in the film i was disappointed at the performance of larry bagby  whom i usually find entertaining if you enjoy watching your friends crappy homemade short films that they shot on their moms 8mm video camera then theres a slight chance you might enjoy this film then again part of what makes those movies enjoyable is that its your buddies playing all the parts you dont know these people so youll probably find it as dull and stupid as i did dear mr nelson go back to film school intern for a while as a pa or a grip or some low level job so you can see how things are properly done in film  then look for as long as you must to find a director of photography who knows what f stop means make sure he has nd filter on hand then try again repeat as many times as needed,negative,0
it´s long time that i and my wife didn´t see such a boring thriller it´s definitively not a gripping story and it is paced so slowly that we nearly fell asleep this could be instead a very low budget tv crime series there are some ridiculous scenes like the one where mafia boss pirano wants to see the jury lady in a red clothes or another mafioso cannot stop to think about her and so on okay perhaps this should have been a romantic thriller but believe me you really don´t miss anything we gave 410,negative,0

i saw it at a german press screening without giving too much away most critics really seemed to like it very much there was even applause afterwards which is quite unusual for that species from my point of view and until now it was the funniest movie of the year it keeps the charm and wit of the three wg shorts and it is enlarged with many references to these and other movies of course there are obvious allusions to monster and werewolfmovies especially to an american werewolf in london jaws king kong and even to peter jacksons braindeaddead alive but also to other genres  characterization was better done in chicken run but that movie had a complete new cast where introduction was necessary here you are already able to know the two main characters so the new wallace and gromitmovie is enjoyed best if you watched and liked the shorts already yet it also works on its own chicken run had the more convenient but also more storytelling plot instead this new aardman masterpiece keeps that crazier and somehow more isolated feeling of the wg shorts children should also enjoy it very much especially because of the sweet rabbits if you love cute bunnies this is a mustsee for you and because gromit has a lot do to and really steals the show children also love dogs   but many jokes are thought for a more adult audience there are even soft sexual allusions in it the movie manages like shrek 12 and the incredibles to fulfil high level entertainment for the whole family with adding a british and at least a little bit darker edge to the humour of american animated movies  the animation is  as expected  superb and they kept true to the aardman style because they didnt put in too many digital effects  i realized just a few when it came to wallaces inventions  finally the score works fine in the movie although one of the main themes definitely is borrowed by randy edelmans dragonheart score  the bad thing is it will probably take another six years from now until we can see a new animated gem from nick park  co,positive,1
why is it that in the 50s and 60s italians made so of the best movies and then during the 70s and 80s made nothing but zombie and cannibal movies probably because art films didnt make any money  the cannibal movie unlike the zombie movie which was created by americans and exploited by italians is a purely italian creation designed as a mondo exploitation showcase and to make as much money as possible no artistic integrity getting in the way here eaten alive came during the cannibal movie heyday the director umberto lenzi hadnt even hit his stride yet his genre classic cannibal ferox was still a year away  in plotting similar to read ripped off from ruggero deodatos seminal cannibal classic cannibal holocaust a woman janet agren receives word from the police that theyve received a 8mm film from her sister shes gone missing in africa and its suspected that the tribal ritual depicted on the film may have something to do with it mel ferrer as a professor of somethingoranother tells her that a man named jonas ivan rassimov has started a jonestownlike cult in new guinea and thats where the sister is the woman hires a guide robert kerman to take her through the jungle to find the cult and her sister and wouldnt you know it the jungle is full of cannibals   one sentence should sum it up if youve seen on cannibal movie youve seen them all mostly because these films steal shamelessly from each other lenzi copied cannibal holocaust to make this film and retooled this to make cannibal ferox deodato copied parts of this for hit and run and because they all share the same material they all feature the same traits awful photography boring scenery terrible dubbing overacting and exploitation exploitation exploitation genre fans will have a ball since everyone in it is a genre veteran rassimov and kerman have a scenery eating contest agren exists solely to be naked raped or in peril plenty o gore for all the sickos out there the cannibals who do actually appear to be native cannibals eat lunch met disguised as human flesh and in the grand tradition of cannibal movies any live animal shown onscreen is usually killed shortly thereafter overall really not a good experience but im sure there are psychopaths out there who find this excrement entertaining i know i did,negative,0

i caught this movie at a small screening held by members of my colleges gaming club we were forewarned that this would be the reefer madness of gaming and this movie more than delivered  tom hanks plays robbie a young man restarting his college career after resting for a semester what we the viewer find out as the movie progresses is that robbie was hopelessly addicted to a roleplaying game called mazes and monsters a game that he gets reacquainted with after a gaming group recruit him for a campaign  this movie is laughable on many many levels one scene features the group gaming by candlelight which is probably the best way i can describe it while im sure that this was meant to be cultish in some way as most gamers know its horribly inaccurate most roleplay sessions are done in welllit rooms usually over some cheetohs and a can of soda  the acting while not oscarcaliber isnt gutwrenchingly awful either this is one of tom hankss first roles and bosom buddies and bachelor party were still a year or two over the horizon the supporting cast while not very memorable still hand forth decent performances  mainly the badness lies in the fact that it was a madefortv movie that shows the dangers of gaming worth a view if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night,negative,0
first i would like to say how great this it is astounding and sometimes shocking and to say the least im 11 years old and this is my favorite movie i can definitely stand a boring film but this is anything but boring it is like a trip through humanity its stark realism shows through this monumental masterpiece it is a heart wrenching tale of two down and outers voight and hoffman who build a mutual friendship joe buck voight a naive texan stud comes to new york to make it rich by entertaining women soon he meets rico ratso rizzo hoffman who is a poor man barely being able to pay rent ratso becomes joes manager but soon both men cant find joe a job which results in stealing food as they try and survive on the streets of new york we realize how tough it is they cant get joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party joe makes some money and soon joe takes ratso on a ratsos dream spot florida the final five minutes are heart breaking yet some of the greatest moments in the film from midnight cowboy we get a stark and sometimes disturbing urban view on life,positive,1

without being one of my favorites this is good for being a change of pace even if only for a few minutes  it all starts with a big fight between tom jerry and spike who is renamed butch here theyre all beating each other but suddenly spike makes a heroic and admirable decision he stops the fight and suggests that they all should be friends so all of them sign a peace treaty and become friends which isnt going to last for long  meanwhile the three become affectionate patient and kind to each other they even save each other when one of them is in danger of life the relationship goes nothing but excellent until a very big steak appears and they all become greedy the three are guilty to return to their usual fights and rivalries  but still to see tom jerry and spike as friends is truly a delightful and grateful experience even if only for a while  oh by the way as a curious fact two songs from the wizard of oz are played here in instrumental versions were off to see the wizard and somewhere over the rainbow,positive,1

the cameramans revenge is an unusual short not because of the subject matter adultery or because its animated winsor mccay had introduced little nemo on film by this time but because it depicts bugs to tell the story ladislaw starewicz had originally wanted to film actual bugs fighting but couldnt get them to do it on camera because of the hot lights they suffered through so he took dead ones and started using stopmotion techniques to manipulate movements to his satisfaction this short does a good job of putting human characteristics on little creatures such as riding motorcycles painting filming kissing and dancing starewicz would also make frogland 1922 and the mascot 1933 but his first notable work would be this one if youre interested in this and the other shorts mentioned check your local library to borrow the dvd the cameramant revenge and other fantastic tales from image entertainment,positive,1
i am a fan of good historical fiction and was thrilled at the thought that someone would take a well written book series and film it writing scripts is not like writing regular fiction but when you have a book you are adapting it would be nice to actually follow the plot line  the portrayals of the vespasians the actual emperor and his 2 sons titus and domitian was horrid they acted like a cookie cutter caligula and were the bad guys in this adaptation there was a scene with titus dispensing justice as if he was caligula from the movie of the same name the way the vespasianii are portrayed in the books mostly follow the reports of historians writing in that time period  they were fair and sane not tainted by the imperial claudian insanity  helena the love interest of marcus didius falco gives as her reason for divorcing pertinax one of the traitors referenced in the title was that he was a traitor yet in the books it was because he ignored her and she felt that she would be better off marrying someone who valued her as a person  marcus in the movie gets a slave named justus yet in the books he could barely afford his apartment let alone afford a slave there was certainly no romantic interlude between the nonexistent slave justus and a female gladiator  on the whole if you want good cookie cutter roman stereotypes get caligula if you want good roman from the classical history viewpoint get i claudius,negative,0
gritty drama emotionally powerful blah the bbc has lost out big time to masterful productions such as the wire sopranos and carnivale from hbo okay so the budget may be a lot smaller but the street last night was badly acted predictable unrealistic stereotypical insensitive and a big fat waste of time tv british tv is not as good as it used to be and is falling further and further behind the american productions  there was no sense of brutal violence from the local gangster there was no indication that this man was insane enough to beat up a man he has respected for such a long time there was no remorse when he did it and this shouldnt be the sort of character that would back down when bob hoskins called his son a pansy in a display of bravery  i wish i was more eloquent to express my disdain for this show but i am not and although i cant prove my point well enough believe me when i say that this was rubbish shock tv that provides no real inward looking perspective on life  15 stars,negative,0
i think that this is possibly the funniest movie i have ever seen robert harlings script is near perfect just check out the quotes section on second thought just rent the dvd since its the delivery that really makes the lines sing  sally field gives a comic overthetop performance like youve never seen from her anywhere else and kevin kline is effortlessly hilarious robert downey jr is typically brilliant and in a very small role kathy najimy is a riot as the beleaguered costumer i was never much of a fan of elisabeth shue but shes great here as the one real person surrounded by a bevy of cartoon characters on the set of the sun also sets  that rumbling you feel beneath you is hemingway rolling over in his grave either that or hes laughing really hard  five stars funny funny funny,positive,1
solomon and sheba was the kind of film that you just had to go and see back in the late 50s when i was a kid a biblical epic spectacular with well known performers unusual costumes lots of extras and battle sequences so i went to see it but i remember that back then solomon and sheba didnt impress me at all which was a strange thing since i had enjoyed a lot the ten commandments quo vadis helen of troy and others the point is that when you are a kid you disregard things in pictures that adults dont bad acting for instance and you are easier to please with warriors in their armors battles sword duels and action so if youre not impressed then something is wrong with a product of this genre   this film though it has some of such features is definitely standard and average yul brynners wooden performance as the hebrew king doesnt even light when he has voluptuous and half naked gina lollobrigida dancing around him provocatively she is better and renders an acceptable acting george sanders doesnt look interested in what he is doing and marisa pavan pier angelis twin sister doesnt add at all as a sort of brynners conscience  the final sword duel between brynner and sanders is just for the plot and lacks interest and intensity it had to filmed thats all  not a good farewell for director king vidor solomon and sheba will probably be remembered as ty powers last unfinished picture,negative,0
my wife and i watched this movie because we plan to visit sicily and stromboli soon fortunately or unfortunately the landscape and seascape complete with tuna are the only believable members of this cast we expected reasonable wellwritten and wellacted movie but were disappointed its only redeeming grace is an extended and remarkable fishing sequence full of authenticity thrashing tuna nets wooden boats with long oars and passionate if superstitious fishermen  the movies sequencing is stagy its dialogue stilted and the acting ranges from stiff to completely overthetop one scene in which bergman stresses out as her macho native and naïve husband sics his ferret on an innocent but apparently already deceased rabbit would be perfect grist for a monty python skit  when the volcano blew we hoped for a merciful end to the suffering ours and the casts unfortunately the movie continues to flail on staggering finally to a melodramatic and absurd ending unless youre really into oldtime tuna fishing pass this hokey effort by,negative,0
a very good episode although not as devastating a finale as the end of season 1 the idea to make it a desmond flashback worked very well and henry ian cusick was fantastic perhaps putting in the best performance of this entire series but my only complaint would be the michael plot line felt very much like a subplot and after three minutes the previous episode i thought it would feature more but the strength of cusicks character and performance pulled it through the plot developments as always left more questions then answers like who are the others something we still dont know and where are they taking jack sawyer and kate what was the white light what impact has it had are locke eko and desmond dead as the hatch destructed around them if they are it would be a major mistake because these three are the most interesting characters and the series would suffer without them and terry oquinn has been fantastic throughout both series as locke a fitting finale to a better series then the first,positive,1
even if you do not typically enjoy documentaries odds are you will find this one fascinating not only does it have a wellmapped out plot that while easy to follow contains its interesting detours it also has a very strong emotional resonance and not one that relies on a simple specific tone instead the emotions here are as profound and turbulent as the seas featured  that being said if you know nothing of donald crowhurst and the 1968 singlehanders boat race around the worldas was the case for meplease stop reading and rentview this film   spoilers follow  my friend brian recommended this at the same time that my aunt had sent me a clipping linking this film with antonionis work in 2007 i was mesmerized by several of antonionis films still am to connect this film to antonioni i think is a bit of a stretch the character most likely to be seen in one of michaelangelos movies is francoise moitessier de cazalet its funny on the main imdb page he isnt even listed as playing himself which is probably a function of his lengthy name as opposed to his self realizationrenunciation since moitessier sails right out of the race that could be considered is a bit like anna in lavventura quite a major minor character  while there are many things to love about this film the actual footage from the time the stoic best friend the sheer power of the roaring forties i walked away with a simple connection a man truly at sea there have been times in my life where i wonder how i got to such a point caught between dreams and reality feeling like a stowaway in my own skin it may be that im reading too much into this documentary and that in turn the directors read too much into crowhurst but i found that sense as spellbinding as the other secrets kept in this film  on the odd chance that crowhursts wife who seemed a remarkable study in restraint with understandably conflicted overtones and his children so young in the found footage and still young at this late date in the sense of their pain and pride for their father i am certain the comments here and the film itself fail to catch the man that your father was in his death however he has given the world a glimpse of something like a lost myth he is a pregps odysseus never finding his body adds to the air of frail immortality if not the stature of a cosmic being of which he had writ  this film sticks with you after the viewing as if you expect another twist to emerge from the deep waters or at the very least you hope for the moitessier sequel  thurston hunger 810,positive,1
in the immortal shaun of the dead we are introduced to a london where the slackers and the highandmighty alike are forced to battle flesheating reanimated corpse versions of their friends and family at the end of the film it is suggested that the zombies are rendered harmless and used as cheap labour fido presents us with an epilogue to shaun set in 1950s america in a hilariously witty and original whatif movie  the film is set postzombieapocalypse for a change after the terrors of the zombie wars ended by the creation of the zomcon company and their patented zombie collars which make the corpses as docile as lambs every town in the world is fenced off from the wild zone the oncefertile landscape torn asunder by the surviving zombies and leftovers from the apocalyptic wars the idyllic town of willard is your typical pristine 50s suburbia with one small difference social status is measured by a familys amount of domesticated zombies unfortunately the robinson family has no zombies whatsoever due to their patriarch bills fear of the reanimated dead timmy robinson and his mother helen both suffer from the pressures of suburban life until the day that helen purchases a zombie servant in a desperate attempt to impress the neighbours  the zombie earns timmys love when he rescues him from a pair of violent bullies and the two form a bond to rival the classic boyandhisdog cliché a boy and his zombie timmy names his pet fido and he soon becomes an aid for both timmy and helen to escape the prisonlike routine bill has put them in but when fidos domestication collar goes on the fritz and he devours the elderly mrs henderson the robinsons have to contain their connection the sudden wild zombie epidemic and still manage to keep their beloved fido  a film whose sharp wit and satirical gore carry it just as much as its allstar cast including the matrixs carrieanne moss as helen robinson and billy connelly as fido fido is a zomcom for the ages with some rather twisted subplots  for example the sweet and unsettling feelings that helen and fido begin to have for each other  and a poignant commentary on 50s suburbia and the zombie genre the film manages to bring out the worst and the best in its characters while still enabling you to care for them  fido is by far one of the best dark comedies ive ever seen one of the best films that ive seen in a long time and the best zomcom since the incredible shaun of the dead,positive,1
i totally agree that nothing is a fantastic film ive not laughed so much when watching a film for ages and david hewlett and andrew miller are fantastic in this they really work well together this film may not appeal to some people i cant really say why without spoiling it but each to their own i loved it and highly recommend it  the directing is great and some of the shots are very clever it looks as though they may have had a lot of fun when filming it  although there are really only main 2 characters in the film and not an awful lot of props the actors manage to pull it off and make the film enjoyable to watch,positive,1
super troopers was an instant classic club dread while disappointing to many had its moments puddle cruisers has fewer moments i saw this movie on the shelf of my local video store and saw at the bottom that it was made by the broken lizard group who made super troopers so naturally i picked it up i only found one scene to be laugh out loud funny a far cry from super troopers all in all i was very disappointed i would not recommend this to anyone unless you have an abundance of free time and really need to kill some time however youre better off playing video games or watching something that might make you laugh or think,negative,0
after watching caddyshack 1 id heard there was a sequel and decided to look it up the movie seemed pretty bad and i told myself to stay away but stupid me gave in and actually bought the damn thing all the reviews and everything bad youve heard about caddyshack ii are true the movie is simply worn of ideas and the lamest plot and jokes ive ever heard the gopher the acting the whole movie really is bad randy quaid was funny though  just stay away from this movie as much as you can is all i can really say i deeply regret watching and buying the dvd but not sure which was the worser decision just stay away as much as possible,negative,0
this film wasnt programmed in italian cinemasi have seen it at a manifestation called fantafestivali find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark the use of fluorescent colors is ridicule and theres no suspence in the film music is completely out of the story and i dont have words to describe the visual effectsif you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting but a few minutes later it becomes busythe story is interesting but the development needs a complete review,negative,0
i looked forward to watching this film and then realised that any hope of a coherent dialogue between the actors was swamped by the unnecessary swearing now i am not a prude in any way but to shout obscenities at each other does not a good film make ewan bremner is arguably one of the worst actors in the world at this time witness his performance in the god awful life of stuff  his cockney accent is almost as bad as his edinburgh accent avoid how many more of these films kiss kiss bang bang beautiful creatures do we have to suffer before the film makers realise that the fword the c word etc does not replace proper dialogue,negative,0
some very interesting camera work and a story with much potential but it never comes together as anything more than a students graduate thesis in film school  there are two primary reasons for this fist there is not a single likable character not even a villain we might admire for hisher chutzpah secondly all the acting is awful  even from veteran willem dafoe the ham is so plentiful here you feel like youre at a picnic  but one of those wretched company employee picnics where you drink too much cheap beer and get your hangover before you even stop drinking then you eat an underdone hotdog and throw up  all right im being a little rough on a young director who might still go places  as i said the camera work is quite good  but i feel cheated  the blurb for this film suggests we will get to watch a modern western and the dvd packaging has pictures on it that suggest this as well  but nobody actually connected to the films making seems to know that this is the kind of film theyre supposed to be making  that betrayal is what hurts but even without it the fact remains that we dont like these characters we feel embarrassed for the actors the story is hopelessly muddled and in the last analysis we just dont care  i took it out of the dvd player about half way through but the rental store wouldnt give me my money back  now that really hurts,negative,0
like a terrible cancer raining out of the sky i wandered into this crock on some movie channel the other night being a fan of bad movies and actively engaging in the purchasing and viewing of said bad film i was intrigued by the idea of a genuinely terrible looking action movie coming from modern times after that wore off though i found my hands inexplicably turning against me grabbing at anything in range and stabbing about my head and neck something sinister was in that tapeerrwhere was ianyway this ranks among the more embarrassingly bad pieces of film ive run across william forsythe cant play more than one character and that character is always a walking joke even when set into a comic background and given things to do and say that are supposed to be funny ala deuce bigalo hes laughable in the wrong way erika eleniak is much the same having starred in her fair share of terrible movies and done terrible jobs in all of them she doesnt fail to help scum up this one classic bmovie villain guy andrew divoff does a respectable job but barely even has any scenery to chew on even reliable standby for bmovie action daniel bernhardt fails to deliver anything bordering on entertainment as for the films own merits the plot is lame the script just like the action and the plot movement is both dull andwell stupid for lack of a better adjectivelord knows they didnt put any effort into it why should i  anyone who has seen enough movies has seen some bad ones and anyone who has seen enough bad ones can learn to appreciate them but there is simply nothing here to be enjoyed unless you are among the most bad movie tolerant and simply feel so inclined as to test your mettle before you do though take it from me this one isnt even terrible enough to be enjoyed unlike saysome of the more ludicrous italian zombie films a fan of bmovie action would be much better off checking out most any of bernhardts other films or pretty much anything else that has ever been put to film for that matter america simply is not the place to go to for action it seems especially not now if you have a craving check out anything from over the seas films like heroic duo or the slightly less normal hakaideralong with anything else in the awesome keita amemiyas cannon will provide a lot more fun and way better action than your apt to find elsewhere especially here,negative,0

homegrown is one of those movies which sort of fell through the cracks but deserves better when i first saw it i had a lukewarm reaction but over time its really grown on meno pun intended  the more i see it the more i appreciate it the writing is topnotch as is the acting throw in a few surprising cameos and good direction and you end up with a great little film  its also good to finally see hank azaria get a chance to shine in a starring role and thornton delivers his usual quality performance even relative newcomer ryan phillippe delivers playing a friendly innocent with wit and subtlety  on a side note homegrown is simply a must see if youre a billy bob thornton fan it appears stephen gyllenhaal was influenced by earlier thornton projects like one false move and sling blade though homegrown is certainly a lot more tongueincheek than either and thorntons role as a character who is both sophisticated and downtoearth is a perfect match for the actor,positive,1
this movie came very close to being a good flick the direction needs to be a bit smoother to progress from one piece to the next to make it more plausible in particular the main characters need to escape is not explicit enough is he trying to kill himself is he trying to escape his life does not seem to be that bad so it makes it more difficult to swallow that he wants to leave his life so much also it is not very clear how much in love he has fallen with jennifer jason l if the movie was reworked with some more attention to these details it would have been great on the other hand for an indy flick its pretty good maybe if you have a couple of drinks to dull the logical thinking it would be more fun  ,negative,0
the progression of the plot is enough to rope one in and create curiosity about the outcome however ultimately the feeling that remains is that the producers of the movie forgot to end it if the intention was to create a perpetual circle occasionally done in the twilight zone it was too sloppy to view as a positive effort,negative,0
a really very bad movie with a very few good moments or qualities  it starts off with pregnant linda blair who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks im not sure she jumps through a window and wakes up and we see she is very pregnant the degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movie  she and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who i thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies on the island already are david hasselhoff and his germanspeaking virgin girlfriend you know how germans are said to love hasselhoff hes taking photographs and shes translating an esoteric german book about witches i think  also traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it and a real estate agent and a woman i thought was their daughter evidently she was an architect and linda blair and the boy are the older couples children i guess they all traveled to the island together but it really seemed like linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them maybe they were filmed separately  the hotel seems neat certainly from the exteriors but it isnt used to any great effect an old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in german sometimes which he eventually records on his sesame street tape recorder  people start getting killed either in their dreams or sucked into hell or something some of these gore scenes are ok but not enough to recommend the movie though the copy i watched stated it is uncut on the box cover the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut much of the scene is showing another characters reaction shots since were not seeing anything ourselves the creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messylooking wound of a mouth rapes someone he looked particularly nasty theres a laughably and painfully bad scene in which linda blair is possessed i wish if a horror movie is going to cast her they would do something original with her role and let her leave exorcist behind her except for the yearly horror conventions  in the weird largely italian tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to this is also aka la casa 4 and ghosthouse 2 that is it is supposedly a sequel to casa 3  ghosthouse la 1988  its not thats also a better movie than this one la casa 1 and two were the evil dead 1981 and evil dead ii 1987  again unrelated to witchery and la casa 3 and much better than those theres also a casa 5 la 1990 aka house 5 which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake la casa series and the series house house 1986 house ii the second story 1987 the horror show 1989 aka house iii and house iv 1992 hows the horror show fit in there it doesnt really it claimed to be a sequel thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less or more confusion oddly the horror show is also aka horror house and la casa 5 is also aka horror house 2 does your head hurt yet,negative,0
the proverb never judge a book by its cover was coined as a warning to those who fail to look beneath the surface   as i viewed the artwork toking of the ants i instantly thought horror the arcane imagery proudly displayed on the cover  back spoke of a dark vision the synopsis promised a story of murder betrayal  retribution instead what i discovered beneath that surface was less interesting than what you can find under your average rock  king of the ants features chris l mckenna as sean crawley an average guy ready to make a name for himself in this world even if it means murder except sean crawley is someone you dont care about never once did i feel any compassion or sympathy for this character in fact hes downright unlikable but not as much as daniel baldwin ray mathewswho turns in an uninspired performance as a made all the worst by the utterly laughable dialogue he is forced to recite throw in kari wuhrer as a grieving widow who apparently has unconditional trust esp in the homeless and little to no common sense and george wendt as duke which is basically a sober norm from cheers but mean  now there are a couple of interesting hallucination sequences in this film the source of the cover images but this film never delves further into that world it prefers to bombard you with unmotivated characters bad dialogue and unlikely event after unlikely event oh the horror,negative,0
the world may have ended unfortunately this film survived as yet another testament to canadas inability to make movies that go beyond the execrable maybe its because all our really good people norman jewison martin short et al go to hollywood in fact its too bad short wasnt cast in this apallingly pretentious and banal film he might have given it some credibility the canadian government should realize  and this movie is a magnificent example  that shovelling money into the trough does not result in good cinema if the people lapping up these public funds had had to compete they might have been forced to come up with something worthwhile as it is they have produced yet another snickering embarassment,negative,0
four daughters introduced john garfield to audiences and that is what is remembered most about this film today unlike some actors who appear in several films before their screen image gels garfield established his immediately with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth and talk of the fates being against him  its actually the story of four girls their widowed musician father claude rains and their various suitors one of whom felix is played by handsome jeffrey lynn hes the one they all have a crush on but hes in love with buff priscilla lane then she meets neerdowell mickey borden who falls for her as well when buff realizes that one of her sisters is in love with felix she leaves him at the altar and marries mickey  this is a fairly formulaic story given life and sequels by the acting garfield has already been mentioned but priscilla lane was by far the strongest of the daughters the most interesting and the best actress jeffrey lynn was a fresh and goodlooking leading man and this film got him off on the right foot with warners however true stardom was not to be like many others of the era he went into the service and when he came out he had a bronze star but not much of a career he later went into television and real estate claude rains is warm and wonderful as the patriarch  so popular was four daughters that it inspired four wives and four mothers as well as reuniting much of the cast again in daughters courageous where the actors played different characters  very enjoyable a nice remembrance of simpler and probably happier times and a chance to see john garfield in his first film,positive,1
this is the first time im writing a comment on a movie on imdb but i had to write it for this one its 3 hrs of unadulterated torture from the starting u get the idea that the movie is gonna be bad the acting is pathetic im a big fan of ajay devgan loved him in bhagat singh but he is at his worst in this movie amitabh seems to have worked hard for this one but somehow the fear is missing prashant raj is a non actor and the most irritating part of the movie is nisha kothari i have no clue why the director took her in this movie the background score is repetitive somehow i felt that ramu tried to repeat a sarkar the color theme the background score the camera angles but it didnt work please dont watch it,negative,0
i disagree with much that has been written and said about this supposed masterpiece of the german new wave   1 there are major flaws in simple exposition in the basic communication of critical plot points as relating to marias abortion and the secret contract between oswald and her husband how many viewers understood that the husband agreed in exchange for substantial financial remuneration not to return to and reclaim his wife until oswald was dead  2 the ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental the original screenplay called for maria to commit suicide after the reading of oswalds will on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to oswald in the final version however maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide maria is then summarily blown up rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her selfdelusion and moral compromise  3 fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public on the private the political on the personal contrary to what the critics and experts assert i dont think it works merely intruding historic radio news or the sound of the jackhammers of german reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama   the selfish ambition of marias rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the socalled economic miracle of postwar germany maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place but is in reality unoriginal and nonspecific women have been asserting their independence by using sex for selfadvancement for ages   4 lastly there are several instances of inexcusable sloppiness and amateurishness  fassbinders drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have had their effect unknown people talk off screen without ever being seen music is clumsily intrusive in places and melodramatic posturing sporadically substitutes for acting  strangely for a movie condemning a country for willful collective amnesia of the holocaust it itself never mentions it once,negative,0
hitchcock would be proud of this movie even when nothing happens it is suspenseful director david lynch overuses a few cheap thrill tricks here and there but he intersperses them with other cinematographic techniques to keep it from becoming obtuse  altogether surreal this movie is like waking up and remembering most of a dream but not enough to make it sensible i am still trying to figure it all out and will probably have to see it again to catch things i missed and which may help me understand it better it is a very detailed plot that very slowly comes together so you must be patient and pay attention get your bathroom trip out of the way before it starts and yet the plot is overshadowed by the theme the mood the character development and the filming techniques  the dual roles of the main actress naomi watts showcase her enormous talent that is when i could get my eyes off of her costar what an acting pair  lynch surprises throughout the movie with unusual camera angles the lengthtiming of editing cuts jumping back and forth between scenes combined with smart use of music and sounds it all helps to build suspense in our minds doubtless a major objective of the director well he kept me on the edge of my seat even had me talking to the actors to be careful here and not be so naive there you know the kind of stuff you want to smack your kids for doing at the movies,positive,1
within the first few minutes of this dutch thriller we learn that krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps sans underwear fantasizes about murdering his roommate tries to steal a magazine from a news stand and lusts after a studly young man he meets at the train station and hes the hero of this nonsensical movie that is all dressed up except for krabbe in at least one scene too many but has nowhere to go the basic plot is very simple but is dragged out to nearly two hours before reaching a pointless conclusion verhoeven has a nice visual flair but resorts to scenes of wild hallucinations overt symbolism and gratuitous gore when he runs out of ideas,negative,0
i did not expect much from this film but boyoboy i did not expect the movie to be this bad chris rock is not showing a good act here you cant get the feeling that his caracter is real i think the movie would have been a bit better if its drama or romantic scenes would have been a less part of the movie and morebetter humor was involved the movie is like the film makers were having a bad hangover making it in the making of they dont show a single smile this is a very bad film i gave it three out of ten because of few smiles it gave me but i did never laugh,negative,0
when i saw gone with the wind i thought that there could not be better actors than vivian leigh and clark gable to play scarlett and rhett but then i saw the movie scarlet i fell in love for this dramatic story i love timothy dalton as rhett butler hes fantastic this is a movie i could watch a thousand times and it still wouldnt bore me,positive,1
the wrinkle in time book series is my favorite series from childhood i have read and reread them more times than i can count over the last 35 years the characters with all their virtues and flaws are near and dear to my heart this adaptation contained very little of the wonderful magical spiritual story that i love so much to say i was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement  if you have never read the books i imagine you will enjoy the movie the acting is passable the special effects are well done for a made for tv movie and the story is interesting however if you love the books avoid this movie at all costs  i found this statement at the wikipedia page of the novel in an interview with newsweek lengle said of the film i expected it to be bad and it is  i like another reviewer here feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind,negative,0
although flawed in its view of homosexuals this movie will shed light for the viewer about the myths and inaccuracies concerning aids despite the depressing subject matter this film depicts a warm friendship between two boys and will make you laugh as well as cry very wellacted by all especially joseph mazzello and brad renfro the language is a little strong though appropriate and its an entertaining and intelligent film for the whole family but remember to have the kleenex ready,positive,1
this film wasnt good at all i was able to catch it at a film festival and didnt appreciate the content i was forced to watch its a well shot film about family looking to reconnect after the death of the familys cornerstone gabrielle union dies the film stars billy dee williams as gabrielles unions brother well actually gabrielle union portrayed the woman in her early years which should help explain why the woman was billy dee williams older sister this had to be billy dee williams worst performance in his career ever he looked as if he didnt remember his lines in a few scenes he was an unlikable hardly ever empathetic character who fathered a daughter while married to a white woman whom he already had a daughter with as well the two daughters are older now and while the daughter he had with the white woman lucy was trying to connect with him his other daughter didnt want anything to do with him billy dees character was so pathetic that the only way they can get him to fly in from paris for his sisters funeral was by telling him that the funeral had already passed and his late sister left him with the responsibility of handling her paperwork why they had to fool him because he didnt like attending funerals i know youre asking but he didnt want to attend his own sisters funeral too yes he claims he didnt like being around the forced feelings of emotions that is shared amongst the people paying their respects he didnt want anything to do with that now were suppose to empathize with that ahole the rest of the performances in the film were flat with equally flat characters the director and editor didnt care to consider the pacing of the film the flashbacks were painful to watch it was a bad film however it seems to be the favorite at black film festivals a film that glorifies africanamericans dependence on caucasians to find a love that they can settle down with even if it is a healthy relationship when lame love stories like this win best of festivals at the black film festivals it makes me question the judgment of black people on film in these same festivals the only films that win awards are educational films about african american culture and black films directed by caucasian directors im not saying that anything is wrong with a white person directing stories written for people of color the problems with these films is that they never argue from both point of views which are usually the films that actually speaks to the masses these films are often onesided forms of didacticism these films fail at executing the powers of both sides of the argument that the film is revolved around the writers and directors never compose the scenes and sequences that contradict your final statement with as much truth and energy as those that reinforce it these films always slant the argument what i am saying is are the people running these black film festivals judging a film off of pure content which to me means directing acting writing cinematography editing etc or are they judging films off of strictly the message being delivered about african american culture are we suppose to expect a film like constellation to have a shot in the world against films like million dollar baby and sideways what happened to film being entertaining when i mean entertainment i mean the ritual of sitting in the dark staring at the screen investing tremendous concentration and energy into what one hopes will be satisfying meaningful emotional experience why cant these festivals appreciate films that get their messages across without preaching why cant these black film festivals acknowledge films that are well told pieces of work that are brutally honest telling the truth i believe we have no responsibility to cure social ills or renew faith in humanity to uplift the spirits of society or even express our inner being we have only one responsibility to tell the truthrobert mckee now thats something i totally agree with these same black film festivals put down hustle and flo as if it is that awful film stereotyping blacks however its an honest film about a pimp with a dream a pimp cant dream i recall the last time i saw a real pimp he was a human being and arent they pimps and prostitution a harsh reality in our society at large not just in the black community but all over the powers that be in black hollywood believe that films like this are making afroamericans look bad in the eyes of others as if others dont know that there are pimps in the hood the truth is until african american people in film can accept the truth about themselves and dare to share it with the world then our films will never have a chance in the world this film was awful the best thing was the cinematography and zoe,negative,0
supposedly a movie about a magazine sending journalists to investigate reports of ufos with one being more or less tolerant or agnostic about the whole affair and the other an aussie a hardened skeptic who laughs at the ufo nonsense its all a crock some kind of money making racket  turns out this movie is actually a deceit and a trap to actually promulgate christian teachings and the christian explanation of ufos one ive heard before this is an ad hoc explanation that is itself not at all biblical but invented by certain modern theologians who can fit anything and everything into their mythology the paranormal its real just demonic unless it takes place in a christian context then of course it is of god simple if it isnt of god its the of the devil stupid so i suppose since beethovens 9th symphony wasnt inspired by god it must have been written under demonic influence or so would the logic lead ad absurdum  we are informed that since the bible does not tell of life on other planets in the universe therefore there is none a version of the ad ignorantium fallacy and that god created the universe so huge so grand to show us his almighty power i think of carl sagans remark that if god created such a huge universe and stuck life only on earth itd have been a tremendous waste of space  so what are ufos they are demonic activity and concern the soon to be earthshaking christian event the rupturei mean rapture before the tribulation the true christians will disappear from the face of the earth en masse causing mass panic confusion car and plane crasheswhatever therefore satan knowing this is sending his demons to basically create an illusion of alien spacecraft and alien abduction which can then be used to explain away this otherwise inexplicable event all part of satans plan which will of course keep people from looking to god or jesus and fall for the lies of the antichrist  this ad hoc explanation also typifies theological mishmash by explaining away one mystery with another in opposition to the scientific method of explaining the unknown the strange and the mysterious in as much as possible first by the known if not solely by the known  its like jumping straight to an alien abduction whenever a child is missing and unaccounted for i think id look first at more mundane explanations like the child has run away gotten lost or been kidnapped for ransom or abducted by a predatory pedophile before invoking aliens or the supernatural or satan or some such  this kind of deceit or trap on the part of fundamentalists is nothing new as young people are often lured to free rock concerts that may start out with something innocuous then suddenly switch to overt christian music followed by a sermon and an altar call this kind of blatant deception one might think would be more satans ballgame but maybe because the christian faith is soon to be in its death throes these guys feel that anything goes any deception or trickery or scare tactics are acceptable to try to keep the faith alive which is facing serious opposition from both secularists as well as competing faiths like islam the worlds fastest growing religion which may well replace christianity as islam is far more cohesive and unified and logically more tenable than christian fundamentalism although this should offer little advantage to mankind as it would be replacing one intolerant thought system with another  and of course the movie ends more or less with a variant of pascals wager the atheistic aussie who is skeptical about just about everything is told well if you are right about there being no afterlife and death is nothing but rotting in the grave no worrybut what if youre wrong  basically statements implying that reality is going to conform to nothing but an atheistic viewpoint or christian fantasy is a false dilemma or black and white fallacy even if the atheists are wrong would not necessarily make christianity correct by default nor if christianity turns out to be full of holes in its theology that the materialistic atheists are therefore correct by default  for all we know native american spirituality might turn out to be the best description of ultimate reality and we might all of use have wished we treated the earth and its creatures a wee bit better  this movie should be stamped right on the box caution contains religious propaganda and not meant for informative or entertainment purposes,negative,0
this is a well directed columbo episode with also some good character but the story just doesnt really know to interest enough and doesnt appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a columbo movie this also goes for the killers plot to kill his uncle its quite simple and doesnt seem as well thought out perhaps this movie didnt really took itself serious enough since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light at least when compared to different columbo movies  for instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief mostly coming from the columbo character himself it makes the movie an enjoyable one to watch but it also gives you the feeling they sort of overdid it times also mostly since it doesnt correspond with most other columbo movies  the characters are good and it helps that it features martin landau in a double role its always funny to see how much different he still looked as a young man while for instance a person such as peter falk hardly changed any over the years he only got grayer the movie also features julie newmar among others who is best know for playing catwoman in the 60s batman life action series its funny how she still moves like catwoman in this movie intentional or is this just her way of acting  its an enjoyable and good to watch columbo movie but it also gives you the feeling that it all could had been a lot better with a better thought out script  710,positive,1
heres another film that doesnt really need much of a recommendation its a classic comedy very funny and entertaining and which of course ultimately inspired a successful television series which many would say was even better i enjoy both personally   for some its hard to warm up to jack lemmon and walter matthau as felix unger and oscar madison when they were were weaned on the tv show starring tony randall and jack klugman or perhaps vice versa but what weve got there in both cases are four good actors who in real life seemed so much like their film counterparts that they managed to make these characterizations their own its neil simons humorous material thats key and where the laughs really originate from  for those who have somehow never heard of the odd couple its the story of a neurotic and fussy neatfreak lemmon who is thrown out of a 12year marriage by his longsuffering wife and takes up residence in the manhattan apartment of his sloppy and totally irresponsible buddy matthau pitting these two unlikely roommates together within the same four walls makes for some hugely funny predicaments,positive,1
its a shame that they didnt trust the original enough to build on it   but robocop 2 takes the great ideas imagination and characters of the original and replaces them with all the stereotypes that sequels have to offer  the beginning commercial was cute and so was the scene that follows reminiscent of the beginning in guys and dolls but aside from a flash of thought here and there this is one film that is a slow dirty slog down into the middle of nowhere  ideas are introduced then dropped interesting characters from the original hardly get any screen time here most of the new characters cain juliette faxx are so boring that they wouldnt hold up no matter what the movie and then theres the tone  in the blessed original paul verhoeven knew how to direct with the kind of attitude where if you cranked up the attitude and the sensibility of a good pulp comic even the most repellent violence would be entertaining kershner although he did direct a star wars sequel doesnt and scene after scene either makes you cringe look away or just tune it out altogether  and whats with robocop he should be the main thing here right but theres whole scenes where he doesnt even show up and what scenes he is in are so halfthought and shakily written that you dont know or care if hes parthuman or partcyborg  since hes allboring  never have i seen such a rapid fall from grace why does hollywood make such bad sequels on purpose why did the filmmakers have a bet going  only one star for robocop 2 the fx are good but the story doesnt even try to match them,negative,0
yes thats true that movie is a horrible piece of you know what almost all fans of sapkowskis books in poland think the same the truth is that polish cinematography can not afford producing fantasy films its a shame when you compare wiedzmin and conan the barbarian for example i hope no one outside poland will ever see this nightmare,negative,0

a terrific comedydrama about the powers of friendship despite its a remake of a 1939 film of the same title it would probably be compared to sex and the city i would not compare to it totally the story starts with marymeg ryan who seems to the life most women would envy shes happily married has a good daughter great friends and a great home but marys perfect life isnt what it seems when she discovers her husband is cheating on her with crystaleve mendes from zachs mary is puzzled and doesnt know what to do but her four good friends sylviaannette bening ediedebra messing and alexjada pickett smith try to be there for her in anyway they can i really dont want to give anymore away but i found this enjoyable and im a man meg ryan is great it is nice to see her in on the screen again after a series of flops and the rest of the cast are also great including eve mendes as crystal just an enjoyable lighthearted comedy,positive,1
the cat in the hat is just a slap in the face film mike myers as the cat in the hat is downright not funny and mike myers could not have been any worse this is his worst film he has ever been in the acting and the story was just terrible i mean how could they make the most beloved stories by dr seuss be made into film and being one of the worst films of alltime and such a disappointment i couldnt have seen a more worst film than this besides maybe baby geniuses but this film is just so bad i cant even describe how badly they made this film bo welch should be fired or the writer should   hedeens outlook 010 no stars f,negative,0
i also saw this movie at a local screening about a year ago first im going to say that it looks great cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic cinematographer i just wish the movie had been as good as it looks i would not call this a horror movie putting in a few shots of a decaying ghost does not make it a horror movie theres no mystery theres no suspense you know who did it the entire time   its a drama you know whats going on with both sides the entire movie the acting was okay i guess but nothing special  and the tagline revenge can be deadlyreallythey should have check how many hundreds of horrorthriller movies have that exact same tagline  it pains me to say some of this but i know a lot of the people who worked on this movie and i know they dont want people blowing smoke up their ass so i give my honest opinion,negative,0
anna christie 1931  on its own terms this version of garbos anna christie shot a year later in german with a whole new cast is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the english version both are american mgm productions garbo is if anything more commanding or more beautiful as a screen presence and her acting is more restrained and she seems frankly more at ease probably for a lot of reasons but we can speculate that she was no longer making her first talking picture so had adjusted quickly  without comparing always one film to the other this anna christie is still the same oneill play with too many words his themes of a woman wanting love without losing her independence are here but it comes off as oddly old fashioned anyway there are some scenes missingthe coney island section is shortened and isnt as goodbut overall its a direct echo of the first film the director jacques feyder belgianfrench is simply redoing what was done already which i assume must be a frustrating experience  its interesting to see both films in succession because they are blocked out exactly the same way not only the sets but the shots are all the same there is an occasional scene lifted from the earlier filmsome of the storm understandably but also a brief scene where marie dressler from the english language version is walking with her friend on a plank over a canal drunk as can be but they are just silhouettes and when the next scene shows their faces we see the german actors taking their parts there is no replacing dressler for sure but for me the german father is more believable and honest in his performance  clearly the themesimmigration wayward fathers daughters turning to prostitution and the troubles of finding true lovehave strong currents back then especially with european threads garbo appropriately plays a swedish young woman,positive,1
probably grossly underrated by all who never experienced the hell of living under communist regime although it seems hard to believe all of it happened actually the reality was even worse than the movie it resembles orwellian fiction only this is no fiction john hurt is excellent as always yes the screenplay is not full of action but life is not either plot is breathtaking yes people were shot yes thousands of them their crime was that they wanted to leave communist paradise without government authorization at times the movie drives tears in your eyes we need more movies like this to really appreciate what america provides for us excellent movie highly recommend god bless our country usa,positive,1
i read some gushing reviews here on imdb and thought i would give this movie a look disappointed on the plus side the male leads are good and some interesting photography but as a whole this movie fails to convince seems to be full of its own self indulgent importance in trying to say something meaningful but falls way short and all in all the picture is an unconvincing mess  it is one of those films classified as a film noir which can be defined as follows  a film noir is marked by a mood of pessimism fatalism menace and cynical characters  well that is the story here 3 losers stumble upon each other with their collective problems that include mental illness alcoholism laziness indebtedness etc and together they conspire to kidnap a child and outwit each other  would have been a much better movie if the story was confined more to the kidnap instead of the character failings of the kidnappers i thought the female lead was way out of her depth and came across as an amateur actress  whilst some good moments i finished up feeling i had wasted my time  410,negative,0
ive been largely convinced to write this review for a number of reasons  1 this is without doubt the worst film ive ever seen 2 unless it gets more reviews it will not be listed in the all time worst films list  which it deserves to be 3 i was kinda lucky  i paid five pound for it ive seen it in shops for 15 pound don not pay that much for this film you will be very angry 4 there are a lot of films out there in the horror genre that are not given a fair rating in my opinion and giving this film a higher rating than them is criminal  the plot summary a guy with no friends meets a tramp who promises the world  well the magic ability to appear to everybody else like somebody else our hero cunningly turns into a teenage girl and joins their gang  sitting on swings babysitting he kills them one by one until he is tracked and found by the police  why is it so bad to begin with the acting is very very bad someone else compared it to a school production no this is worse than any acting ive seen on a school stage  ive bought a number of these previously banned films from the dvd company vipco and not been as disappointed as i was at this okay the acting is bad but the film fails to deliver in every other sense what was the point in making this film when there isnt even any gore okay no gore what else can a film like this offer breats no not even any titillation  its true this film may have a certain charm in its unique naffness but any potential buyerwatcher of this film should be fairly advised that this film is at best worth only one out of ten,negative,0
im only rating this film as a 3 out of pity because it attempts to be worthwhile i love to praise a great movie and im not biased toward male movies legally blonde was an excellent film georgia rule on the other hand was a disorganized weak poorly written unrealistic example of movie making at its worst by the end of the film i didnt care who was lying or if anything was resolved   the most important thing in a film is a good story this story is weak and never develops just because the subject matter is deep doesnt mean the story is good a good story has dynamic characters a dynamic character is one that experiences a major character change and is primed for that change over the course of the movie in georgia rule the character changes were abrupt and undeveloped secondly there were too many attempted dynamic characters pulling off a really good dynamic character is a tough job and takes time youve only got a couple hours in a movie that means that too many attempted dynamic characters will get too little attention to their personal change even if i ignore the poorly written story and the litter of weak dynamic characters i cant even say i liked anyone every character was a mess thats fine if yourre writing american beauty but not when youre attempting a dramatic comedy georgia was a horrible mother her daughter was a horrible mother and daughter and lohan was a horrible excuse for a human being no im not cutting her any slack because she was molested crap happens to everyone and were all responsible for our own actions the dudley do right mormon kid should have had the guts not to compromise his religion and commitmentsand simon i mean seriously what kind of guy lets a 17 year old girl whos been molested just stay over occasionally unless hes an actor or a politician this movie is worth watching if you want to remind yourself what good movie making is not,negative,0
forbidden siren is based upon the siren 2 playstation 2 so many 2s game like most video game turned movies i would say the majority dont translate into a different medium really well and that goes for this one too painfully  theres a pretty long prologue which explains and sets the premise for the story and the mysterious island on which a writer leo morimoto and his children daughter yuki yui ichikawa and son hideo jun nishiyama come to move into the villagers dont look all too friendly and soon enough sound advice is given about the siren on the island to stay indoors once the siren starts wailing  naturally and slowly things start to go bump and our siblings go on a mission beating around the bush to discover exactly what is happening on this unfriendly island with its strange inhabitants but in truth you will not bother with whats going on as folklore and fairy tales get thrown in to convolute the plot even more what was really pushing it into the realm of bad comedy are its unwittingly illplacedoutofthenorm moments which just drew pitiful giggles at its sheer stupidity until its explained much later its one thing trying to come up and present something smart but another thing doing it convincingly and with loopholes covered  despite it clocking in under 90 minutes  i think its a horror movie phenomenon to have that as a runtime benchmark  it gives that almost two hour feel with its slow buildup to tell what it wants to things begin to pick up toward the last 20 minutes but its a classic case of too little too late  what saves the movie is how it changes tack and its revelation at the end again this is a common device used to try and elevate a seemingly simple horror movie into something a little bit extra in the hope of wowing an audience it turned out rather satisfactorily but leaves a bad aftertaste as youll feel cheated somewhat there are two ways a twist will make you feel  it either elevates the movie to a memorable level or provides you with that hokey feeling unfortunately forbidden siren belonged more to the latter  the saving grace will be its cinematography with its use of light shadows and mirrors but i will be that explicit  its still not worth the time so better to avoid this,negative,0
what annoys me with so called science programs such as these is that it is presented as if it were a fact that dinosaurs live millions of years ago firstly nobody can even conduct a scientific experiment to prove that the earth is millionsbillions of years old its a shallow theory based on inaccurate radiometric dating methods with huge assumptions thrown into the evolutionary pot  secondly nobody can prove that evolution ever happened all darwins missing links are still missing  if you look at all the fossils anywhere in or on the earth they are complete animals of a certain kind eg a dog or a cat nobody has ever found the skeleton of a dog turning into a cat or in the example presented in this series a dinosaur turning into a bird  this is utter hogwash theres more proof that santa claus exists than any animal changing into another kind of animal  all the ideas presented in this series is an attempt to eliminate the idea that the universe and the everything in it was created  this series is not science it is a religious world view that hides under the banner of science science is something we can observe and repeat what you are seeing here is science fiction   if you want to watch a science fiction program that has the decency to admit that its a science fiction program then rather watch star trek or star wars,negative,0
as a rebuttle of sorts to the afis top 100 films the british film institute worked out a documentary with martin scorsese  now i am a huge film fan and pride myself on having seen many many films but i am nowheres in comparrison with my idol in this fantastic though long documentary scorsese walks the viewer through several stages of the american history on film this is divided in to several sections including the western the gangster film and the noir full of bouncy enthusiasm martin scorsese is a great tour guide as well as a fantastic professor,positive,1
this film does not fail to engage and move even in 2008 to an audience only familiar with modern overproduced sound and computer enhanced techniques  the experience of the movie goer in 1922 who could only see this in a cinema with others on their big screen must have been truly profound and a thoroughly satisfying experience  one has to ask could a film maker today make a two hour silent movie and make it interesting and achieve the same structure tempo and balance as this movie has silent film making was pure art it had to hold the attention through its structure direction and acting  there was no padding out with more words or computer generated distractions a poorly made or uninteresting silent movie is unwatchable  this film needs to be put into context for those who might be disconcerted with the mention of christian themes this is not a christiany film it is not selling anything these themes along with reference to current moral standards often appear in this era  also church going on sundays was a national past time christianity was a given in most households thus the film is only depicting normal life as it was then the themes would have rung true and deep at the time  it is most odd given the strong support to good christian thinking of this particular movie and it is not preaching religion to anyone only highlighting the difference between hypocrites and the honestthat in 1922 a pastor in an open debate with a representative from the film industry with a large crowd denounced pickford as an example of immorality along with some other individuals he named ny times 1922  maybe they should have watched this movie that also came out in 1922 and learned some lessons  the pastor complained that since the film industry had started church attendance had dropped 500000 the film representative in the debate however made the following observations that saloon attendance had also dropped that there were far more pastors in prison than actors fact and that selecting a few examples from among the many was not representative of the whole  thus there was an ongoing battle between church and the film industry during the early days of film  this is a wonderful film about being honest and true to family friends and to be willing to make sacrifices mary pickford naive honest feisty full of happiness and joy faithful humorous and silently sacrificing  though poor and uneducated she represented the perfect character this however is not thrust down our throat but revealed bit by bit through the film  this is reminiscent of some modern chinese films where characters are slowly languidly revealed over the course of a film and it is this tempo that creates a stronger connection with the character   it has a smooth even tempo for the first half that builds all the elements for the last section the last 30 minutes are great film making and it has to be appreciated it was achieved without the benefit of sound running dialog  it was achieved through deft acting and great directing it is sometimes surprising to realize that at the end of the film you havent hear a word spoken but it feels like you have heard everything  the supporting cast put in great performances especially gloria hope jean hersholt and lloyd hughes   the final few minutes are typical pickford understated humor as she goes outside under the pretext of sweeping the snow a near perfect balance and ending this is a special type of touching humor that should not be underestimated chaplin used this device often and copied some of from pickford  another special observation to be made about silent films and especially pickford films is that the star often has to hold the camera for much of the movie without the audience becoming jaded or bored with the actors overexposure that pickford is usually thoroughly the center of attention through most of her movies but the people still couldnt get enough of her is a testament to her fine acting ability,positive,1
other reviewers have summarized this film noir well i just wanted to add to the whew comment one reviewer made regarding elisha cooks obviously cokefuelled drumming episode this was a doozy i must say cook deserved some acclaim for his frenzied performance  a bit of trivia that i am surmising about cook appeared as a waiter in the 1941 barbara stanwyck film ball of fire he was a waiter in the nightclub where barbara was singing and legendary drummer gene krupa was drumming most energetically is it too much to suggest that cooks spazzy drumming in the later film phantom lady was very much inspired by krupas work as witnessed by cook 3 years earlier   if you watch krupa in ball of fire i think youll note some clearly similar body movements one hopes of course that he was not influenced by any drugs at the time,positive,1
then again i like rachael ray she is fun sweet fresh and such a joy to watch i have to alter just about everything she makes as i am a vegetarianbut its great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality after all she is a television personality i think its cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still appears to be downtoearth the studio audience appears to be rather small but that just makes for a cozier environment some people have posted that the show sucks i guess it depends on your own interpretation of it and of her if you notice the early episodes of 30 minute meals you will see a completely different personality than in those of the past few years im sure she will find her comfort zone with this show as well good luck rachael,positive,1
the only reason i give this movie 810 stars and not 10 is because 1 sinatra is awful and 2 the love interest of kellys character leaves much to be desired imho do love that dean stockwell quantum leap  al is the little boy the dance sequence with jerry mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences i have ever seen tom and jerry is still a personal favorite of mine and my daughters im 28 and shes 4 so while the character is less iconic than mickey he is still a favorite of many children and adults today kelly is as always captivating his eyes full of fun and excitement in every movie i have ever seen him in he always steals the show one of the best dancers of the 20th century it is no wonder paula abdul sampled kellys moves i would also list gene kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century if you were to watch only one part dont miss kellys dance with jerry mouse you will not be disappointed,positive,1
let start off by first saying that i have been a punk fan most of my life i always kind of had a lack of respect for the la scene of the early 80s which the decline of western civilization documents with the exception of x and black flag being more of new york and english punk guy after i saw this movie that completely changed the people shown may look like a bunch of idiotic strung out kids who think they might accomplish something beyond streetcree through their lifestyles but it is a great display of hedonism at its best coupled with some fun loud rock n roll one of the best scenes and actually most insightful is the interview with claude bessy of catholic discipline or kickboy as he was known to slash magazine readers originally from france he rants about punk like a dirty old frenchman and clues in viewers to many aspects of the punk or diy attitude to music politics and life in general darby crash of the germs comes off as a complete idiot most of the time but the germs performance of manimal is pretty decent complete with a young pat smear black flags performance with chavo pederast on vocals it was filmed a couple of years before henry rollins joined the band is decent and x and fear give the best performances in the movie look out for the interviews with the young punk kids youll hear some of the funniest things you have ever heard in a documentary highly recommended,positive,1
things to come is indeed a classic work of speculative fiction both an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress it makes some surprising accurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later but is woefully naive in its utopian ideals  raymond massey cedric hardwicke and ralph richardson make up a fine cast although the drama is played more as a stage piece than a work of cinema there are grandiose if somewhat stilted speeches often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater however there are some profound words there is technology the savior of mankind or the instrument of its destruction the film is a visual feast if one can detach oneself from the age of the effects sure hollywood is more sophisticated today but rarely as inventive for the imaginative the third act is a treat a world with underground cities massive deco bombers space cannons gyro copters and secret organizations of scientist saviors it has all of the makings of a scifi pulp adventure but instead uses the trappings for a philosophical exercise  things to come and metropolis were the hallmarks of neolithic hollywood science fiction cinema they are operatic in scope and visually inspiring technology has long left them behind but their ideas still burst forth there is an artistry there one with more heart and emotion than the computer generated massproduced cinema of today these films are the products of artisans not industrialists,positive,1
the cars in this movie are awesome the acting in this movie is awful the plot and driving scenes dont make much sense and are equally bad if you get really bothered by movies where someone shifts and suddenly goes ridiculously faster save yourself the trouble and money good movie for racing fans well there is a part where they make the mistake of referring to a nascar driver as a rally car driver if you cant tell the difference go watch it youll have a blast it really comes down to this there are really really really nice cars in this movie they are driven horribly and are completely unrealistic the acting is horrible mainly because of the extremely bad plot if you want to see hot girls turn on mtv or vh1 instead i am disappointed that such nice cars would be represented in such a bad movie if the class of the cars were to match that of the movie they should be racing with rusted bicycles,negative,0
excellent film the whole picture was filmed in budapest so i feel proud my little problem was that the trains in the film belonged to the hungarian state railways máv and it is plain to see that they were used in big train not in the local railway  according to the story chikatilo picked up his victims in local railway stations apart from this the film is superb,positive,1
gespenster 2005 forms together with yella 2007 and jerichow 2008 the gespenstertrilogy of director christian petzold doubtless one of the cremedelacreme german movie directors of our time  roughly gespenster tells the story of a french woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a 3 years old child while the mother turned around her head for 1 minute in berlin  and has never been seen ever since then the mother keeps traveling to berlin whenever there is a possibility and searches by aid of timedilated photography for girls of the age of approximately the present age of her age as we hear later in the movie the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter marie however this time when she meets nina everything comes quite different  the movie does not bring solutions not even partsolutions and insofar it is rather disappointing we are not getting equipped either in order to decide if the mother is really insane or not if her actual daughter is still alive or not most disappointing is the end after what we have witnessed in the movie it is an imposition for the watcher that he is let alone as the auteur leaves nina alone the simple walking away symbolizing that nothing has changed can be a strong effect of dramaturgy fex in umberto d but in gespenster it is displaced  since critics have been suggesting freudian motives in this movie let me give my own attempt why is it that similar persons do not know one another especially not the persons that another similar person knows this is quite an insane question agreed from the standpoint of aristotelian logic according to which the notion of the individual holds the individual is such a person that does not share any of its defining characteristics with anyone else so the aristotelian answer to my question is they do not know one another because their similarity is by pure change everybody who is not insane believes that however what about the case if these similar persons share other similarities which can hardly be by change eg scarfs on their left under ankle or a heartshaped birthmark under their right shoulderblade this is the metaphysical context out of which this movie is made although i am not sure whether even the director has realized that despite our modern aristotelian world the superstition conserved in the mythologies of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their individuality and that individuality therefore is not something erratic but rather diffusional so that the borders between persons are open such and similar believes build a strong backbone of irrationalism despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking  a source of gespenster of the most interesting kind,positive,1
please people do not bother with this poorly directed joke the direction was totally wrong from the outset where is the history of his mothers emotional interference and the general madness in the original family why is ed portrayed as this large overbearing imposing figure full of anger and hate what is this crap the writer and director obviously did no research into the history and just wanted to cash in on the infamous gein name the fools who made this movie took so many liberties with the truth its ridiculous if you want t see a brilliant gein film go back to the minor classic deranged to see how ed really was there is humor in that film and ed is portrayed as more of the sad lonely slight man he was accordingto history where is the background story here there is just poorly setup shocks that are not shocking that weve seen before and more accomplished as well take the worst texas chainsaw massacre ripoff and add this one to that list had to give it one out of ten because rating wouldnt accept zero i want my money back if anyone regards this film as stunning is possibly getting a financial kickback to do so,negative,0
the film someone had to make  waco the rules of engagement dissects the evidence behind the standoff in waco texas that led to the destruction of the branch davidian homestead and the alleged government coverup  the first thing you need to know about this film you will see brief but disturbing photos of the victims bodies this is not done for shock value but to illustrate points about the way they died as if you were present at the coroners inquest  the second thing you should know about this film at two and a quarter hours its pretty ponderous  especially if you already followed the events closely at the time if you are unaware of any of the events other than what was reported in the mass media or if the only side of the story you are familiar with is the official government report this may be essential viewing if on the other hand you want a more concise albeit unapologetically one sided version of events you should see waco the big lie  in summary this is pretty much the definitive documentary about this tragic event and is very sobering but as a work of filmmaking could test your patience especially if you have a short attention span and its at times superfluous for those who watched the cspan hearings and the 60 minutes reports  perhaps someday someone will make a documentary that covers some of the stranger aspects of this story such as the bizarre chain of events that led up to the atf raid or the psychological warfare tactics the fbi used blasting rock music at the sect and their charismatic leaders all rock musicians themselves picking up their instruments and turning their massive amplifiers outward to blast their own music right back at them,positive,1
i cannot get over how awful this movie was my eyes want to jump out of my head and my ears are gushing blood from the horrible awful one song soundtrack there are four kids and dog and they run away from a hospital then get away with stealing two cars and a bus no one gives them any punishment or anything to correct them the acting is just so awful it sounds like an instruction video for social studies class i cannot think of one thing that i like about this movie nothing even the kid that loses his dog made me want to vomit he gets his dog back without the lady even seeing the dog run out the door maybe the dog was trying to escape out of this movie then there is some horse manure in the whole mix it was torture watching this movie then at the end the oldest boy says something like staying together isnt a crime and they all hug him and love him stealing gas is a crime stealing two cars and a bus is a crime and he should have went to juvenile hall or something avoid this movie at all costs and especially if you want to keep your family together,negative,0

a romance without feeling a drama of issues without point or drama this film is supposed to be all these and fails on each and every account as if it isnt trying or as if the directoreditorscriptwriter team isnt really trying the actors are ablethey need better support  one element that doesnt fail is the score by george delarue beautiful and moving what a shame its attached to this film in a good film actors words and movements and music synchronize and enhance the impact this editor plastered on music with no regard for dialogue and movement the love scene is particularly grating in this respect an insult to the talents of the lead actors  there is another element in the film that works location photography notably one moment in grand central station id guessed in advance what was going to happen but how it was filmed in that setting was breathtaking  some commentators on this board have pointed out that us assimilation of criminal nazi scientists actually happened during these years of the maccarthy scare the moment the film seems to start looking seriously at american society it switches into conventional romance before any human feelings can move us its away on a predictable thriller escapade  just as the film insults the talents of the actors it insults the issues its pretends and fails to take up  you are warned,negative,0
this film reminded me of the sopranos and not in a good way   david chases seminal mob opera only ever put its foot wrong twice the most jarring and inexplicable instance of which took place in its fourth season when junior soprano went on trial for his life rather than pursue this riveting and pivotal plot line the writers instead chose to completely ignore it focusing instead on bobby baccalieris constant whimpering over his recently deceased wifes frozen pasta dish   when something of genuine interest happens in notorious  for example that first mysterious assassination attempt on tupac shakur that ignited the whole east coastwest coast feud in the first place and ended up leading to the deaths of both tupac and christopher wallace  the film treats it as just another bit of plot to plod through why exactly was tupac so convinced that he was sold out by his own people did he alone nurture his subsequent affiliation with suge knight and was lil kims transformation from prim office drone into sexobsessed vampish diva really as banal as it appears here  none of these questions are even fleetingly addressed by the films screenwriters who are far more interested in depicting wallaces turbulent love life to zero compelling dramatic avail these sequences including a brainfrazzlingly clichéd groupie indescretion in a hotel room are so toothless and bruisingly manipulative that the only real comparison to be made is with a network tv movie  the storytelling in both structure and content is simplistic and trite but more fundamentally as a biopic as something designed to celebrate its subject and educate the uninitiated on the intricacies of their life and work the film is almost entirely worthless the reliance on meatandpotatoes genre plotting coupled with the lifeless musical performances an area in which a film like this should soar surely result in a film that appears to have been designed only to satisfy the whims and demands of those involved leaving wallaces questionable status as a giant in his field as the preserve of the easily persuaded and previously converted only   and the final twenty minutes in which wallaces posthumous cultural identity is broadly painted as being akin to that of a latter day saint quite frankly made me feel like throwing up   on that score much as with any other notorious is crass calculating and compromised,negative,0
its gonna be hard to make this fill 10 lines but ill give it a try just to prevent others from making the same mistake as i did  to watch this awful and boring movie  i like patrick swayze  he did a excellent performance in films like ghost  dirty dancing  point break  north  south tv series but in this movie arghthis movie is so booooooring the acting is awful  the script sucks  well i cant even find one good thing nothing absolutely nothing i was watching it with 2 other friends and we all agreed that this was one of the most boring films we had ever seen and the fact that it lasts for more then 3 hours which we didnt know  when part 1 was over and it said to be continued we almost cried nooooooooooooo do we have to watch 90 minutes more of this movie  its painful to see this movie at no time do you get the impression that the actors are russians the action scenes are extremely bad the only good scene is when the truck explodes in the beginning of the movie the rest is crap go clean your toilet instead of watching this movie and dont come running crying if you do see this movie  you were pre warned personally i would recommend patrick swayze to call his agent and have them recall this movie  its that bad,negative,0
this movie is about the crew of a spaceship who crash land onto a strange bright planet with three suns among the passengers is convicted serial killer richard riddick vin diesel and his nemesis johns cole hauser while the survivors of the wreck are getting their bearings an eclipse of all three suns happens shortly afterwards scary creatures begin to appear and start to pick off the crew members one by one during the eclipse riddick comes into his own as his eyeballs have been surgically shined giving him night vision the crew have to rely on him to try to get them to safety  this is a very stylish film with the colour of the sky changing scene by scene giving it a very strange look vin diesel is brilliant as riddick truly menacing but forced to help people who otherwise would only see him as a threat there is also an underlying humour in his performance as well which adds another dimension to the character this is the sort of role that vin excels in the antihero whos character is not as onedimensional as first appears i can imagine noone else in this role it could have been written specifically for him  roll on chronicles of riddick,positive,1
now and again a film comes around purely by accident that makes you doubt your sanity we just finished studying the novel northanger abbey at school and decided to refresh our memory of this unexciting piece of humourless garbage with the bbc adaptation  the funny thing about northanger abbey is that it actually makes you want to kill yourself the film is nothing like the book for example the subtly evil characters seem to have been turned into transparent stereotypes john thorpe looks like a leprechaun on acid while isabella plays the role of slut catherine the main character is the most depressingly stupid and irritating actress on gods earth she looks like a coffee addict her eyes are like basketballs whilst mr tilney looks and acts like a retired porno stunt double the plot goes completely off the rails at certain points of the film i dont know what the hell the director was thinking when for no reason at all a 7 year old black kid who weve never met before takes the main character out of the abbey and starts cartwheeling in front of her yes thats right cartwheeling nonsense of this kind is occasionally interrupted by catherines fantasies in which she is being carried around a cathedral by an ogre  northanger abbey is basically visual euthanasia so if you want to murder your boss or something like that bbc have basically discovered a new way to kill someone northanger is a barely laughably bad film dont watch it unless youre in a padded cell,negative,0
in this documentary we meet roger the rich manager of a factory in china that makes beads and other trinkets sold and traded at mardi gras in new orleans roger claims the factory girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities it provides but interviews with four of them tell quite another story the girls bleak lives are shown in stark contrast to the bizarre excesses of mardi gras itself filmmaker david redmon should be lauded for getting excellent and rare footage of everyday life inside a chinese factory compound and for landing a revealing oncamera interview with the head of the us company that imports and sells the beads the movie is compellingly told and clearly serves its purpose as a window into what lies behind those ubiquitous made in china labels,positive,1
i just watched this film at an advanced screening i had not read the book and knew nothing of the story but went because the book was voted book of the year by two local colleges so i cannot compare the book with the movie as others have done  in short i thought this was an incredibly moving story the acting was believable and the insight into afghan culture and political history was both interesting and shocking my oldest friend is iranianamerican and so i felt an affinity for certain middle eastern values and traditions that were portrayed in the movie as they reminded me of the times i spent with his family  the themes of friendship family human values and courage under fire are universal and are well developed in the film i wont list the plot details as these can be obtained elsewhere but based on the films technical aspects the acting and above all its heartwrenching story i would definitely recommend this movie,positive,1
i loved this movie im a mexican and was in the least offended by it in fact i think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over mexico its a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse it angers me to read in the news how killers kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells we should have someone like creasy denzel washingtons character a bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante kidnapping is flourishing industry down here at least in the big cities i actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the ones creasy did his fine job upon that would be so marvelous sorry i am that resentful man on fire is a gripping film that you cant miss it might be hard on some of you if you arent used to reading subtitles mexicans do that all the time while watching american movies but the effort will be well worth it some of the editing is a bit fuzzykind of like traffic remember another brilliant take on how corrupt mexico is the movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half i swear youll be cheering as you watch denzel washington dispatch the wrong doers his performance is nothing short of excellent the ending no spoilers ok is a bit sad but im sure youll like it anyway man on fire is one of the years best movies a must own for a dvd collection 9 out of 10,positive,1

its difficult to know where this adaptation starts going wrong because i think the problem begins with the books themselves alexander mccall smith has worked out that you read them not for the detective stories but for his deeply condescending and completely spurious vision of an africa that does not exist hes done for botswana what borat did for kazakhstan  not as successfully but based in as much fact  once i realised this it ceased to gall me that jill scott an american singeractress is cast as mma ramotswe if she is to represent a land that is not africa how appropriate that she is a black woman who is not african shes not the only american on the cast mma makutsi is played by anika noni rose both women are far far too young for the roles theyre playing and far too glamorous both brutally murder the local accents and both focus so entirely on this brutality that they fail to offer much in the way of acting scotts mma ramotswe is bouncy cute and soft roses mma makutsi is an annoying motormouthed bitch  the result is almost unwatchable the principal cast is redeemed only by the presence of lucian msamati who turns in a decent performance as mr jlb matekoni hes comes off smarter and more intense than in the books but i find myself unable to blame msamati for this  hes a shining light in an ocean of suckage the contradictions between his performance and the books are clearly laid at the feet of whichever committee of butchers wrote the script  to me mccall smiths writing has always been highly entertaining yet notoriously bad he refuses to be edited as a result his books contain experiments in grammar that border on the scientific and characters that change name midsentence it is therefore something of an achievement that the writing team on this project actually made it worse  the dialogue is now largely anglicised characters speak of opening up and sensitivity to needs mma ramotswe and mr jlb matekoni flirt openly mma makutsi moans about not having a computer but given her constantly restyled hair makeup and jewellery im surprised she doesnt have a macbook in her handbag along with her visa card  so what are we left with here its difficult to be upset with this crappy adaptation because honestly most of the things i like about the original books are apocryphal anyway mccall smith paints a fictional botswana populated with cute nonthreatening black people who are full of amusing and palatable wisdomnuggets it reads well despite linguistic travesty but it is a vision of how a certain type of white person wishes black people were it just isnt true  given that its hardly surprising that this show sucks as much as it does it remains to be seen whether european and american audiences will even notice however,negative,0
i wholeheartedly disagree with the other viewers of this wretched film the only reason why i didnt rate it 1 for awful was due to the great talent of carmen miranda the beginning and end are the best parents due to her gifted singing and dancing  the problem is with the rest of the picture alice faye comes off quite hollow don ameche has a great singing voice but with the wretched writing material he comes off so terribly corny  the plot is a real stiff here with ameche assuming two parts as a song and dance man and a baron not happily married to faye  it seems that by playing the song and dance man ameches marriage gets a second change to reignite some silly nonsense about the baron having to clear up business and being away allows him to play both parts  sz sakal is given little to do here and so his comedic gifts are not given the opportunity to shine ditto for j carrol naish who actually appears uncomfortable in his role  this is a chica chica boom bomb of a film,negative,0

i was hardly aware of the time in history depicted in this 1971 brazilian black comedy however that is not to say it wasnt accessible to me because the movie makes it very clear its set in 16th century brazil where rival french and portuguese settlers are exploiting the indigineous people as confederates in their battle to assert dominance what is particularly interesting about the movie is that it is made by the portuguese from the point of view of the french the hero is a likable frenchman the portuguese are barbarians and the rest of the french are oppressive and greedy the films portuguese makers are objective because when all is said and done we see that it makes no difference whose side one takes its about heredity overpowered by environment in a time starkly defined by tribes enemies are made and perpetuated and like so the environmental integration never progresses  a frenchman is captured by the portuguese is then captured by an indigenous tribe the tupinambas after they massacre a group of portuguese the tribes shaman predicted they would find a strong portuguese man to cannibalize as revenge for the chiefs brother being killed by a portugeuse musket ball thinking the frenchman is portuguese they believe they now have one nevertheless the frenchman is granted unrestrained course of the village is sooner or later given a wife and assumes their accustomed appearance rather than his western clothes or any clothes another frenchman comes to the village and tells the tribe that their prisoner is indeed portuguese then assures the incensed frenchman that he will tell them the truth when the frenchman finds a secret treasure trove that another european has hidden nearby  i found the opening scene funny because its narration apposed with its contradictions on screen serve as great satire even if the movie didnt seem to want to maintain that tone very much more often its actually not a terribly riveting film the bountiful essential locale fierce way of life and ripened native women make not only the frenchman but us too forget any threat and we have the feeling of him as a free man it should not be that terribly hard to escape the cannibalism is as scarce of desire as the fullfrontal nudity of the cast suggested in lieu as the representative core of pereira dos santoss dry political cartoon of new world mythology and undeveloped social coherence at any rate this 1500sera social commentary shot on location at a bay with 365 islands played almost entirely nude and almost entirely written in tupi encourages effective breakdown of established ways which are topical because theyve repeated themselves for centuries,positive,1
just like most people i couldnt wait to see this oceans 11 sequel but it really stinks i must say it stinks because theres simply no good screenplayit was just cheap i hope the producers donate all the money this movie has made or will make to the tsunamivictims in asia so this movie will have at least one good reason to exist it is so bad i even cant write a decent comment about it buti still advise the creators of this thing to make oceans 13 oceans 13 will be about the same thieves who are trying to steal a screenplay well hidden somewhere in hollywood the 13th member will be a foreign mayberussian screenplaywriter who knows all tricks to write a copy of this well hidden screenplay so they can replace the original theyll have to steal or they need to find at least 13 people to write a decent screenplay for a movie in which not only julia roberts plays herself but even all other starmembers of the oceansfilms 13 people because its the lucky number of andy garcias character,negative,0

that was great fun i never read those chestergouldcomics but its not necessary to know them maybe there were some inside jokes i didnt figure out but what the eye doesnt see the heart cannot grieve over this is such an ironic colourful film and the actors are goodhumoured all together the setting is similar to that in the batman movies but not as dark and grey okay the story is not so original but there is a plot which is not selfevident and a more or less surprising ending  with this movie you could play an interesting game if you watch it with friends dont watch the credits at the beginning and then look whos the fastest to find out who are the famous actors under their makeup,positive,1
was flipping around the tv and hbo was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions so i turned to my twin sister and said hey this looks like fun  truly i love documentaries  so we started watching it at first i thought jonni kennedy was a young man but then it was explained that due to his condition he never went through puberty thus the high voice and smaller body he was on a crusade to raise money for his cause he had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality i cried watched some more laughed got up to get another kleenex then cried some more once jonni kennedys time was up he flew to heaven to be with the angels he was more than ready he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free i highly recommend this if you do not fall in love with this guy you have no heart,positive,1

wow this movie is almost too bad for words obviously the writers wanted to somehow link this to the ghoulies franchise so they got pete liapis from the first one to reprise his role as jonathanonly now hes a cop and has no similar character traits as he did in the first one the ghoulies in this one arent the ghoulies from the last ones the cheap looking puppets have been replaced with even cheaper looking costumed little people instead of being any main antagonist or being evil they are more like the comic relief characters that appeared out of nowhere for no reason  when watching this film for the first time it felt like id seen it before why was this because everything in this was stolen from another movie all the cheesy cop lines and action scenes were from lethal weapon the ghoulies were pretty much like bugs bunny and daffy duck except they werent amusing at all even scenes from the original ghoulies film were sprinkled throughout this flick  i think the target audience was supposed to be adults but the mixture of black magic cartoon slapstick cop drama and bad acting doesnt work at all i hope they dont make a ghoulies v because i dont want a movie studio to lose their money  my rating bomb 78 mins r for violence,negative,0

have just seen the last episode no 32 though the site says only 30 episodes were made and i must comment on the fact that this series was really very good and i would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who enjoys crimecop stories supposedly all 32 were based on fact with information at the end of each episode of the court sentences imposed on the perpetrators of the crimes this has at times been a gritty well acted believable and dare i say entertaining series the fact that the powers in denmark decided to disband the unit was almost unbelievable as they did their work so well and in the series at least never failed to get their man its a definite 1010 for me,positive,1
on first viewing this movie seems to be some kind of fairy tale about a beautiful and significantly white horse once seen never forgotten however viewed strictly within the context of the story the implication is that to survive in the immediate postcivil war america one had to have a horse and not any old horse but a truly great one and eagles wing is such a horse but for a man to be worthy of such a horse is another matter who should own it the native american or the awol soldier the story throughout pits primitivism against civilisation as has been said by other commentators it is ironic that it took an english director to perceive this fact and then develop this simple theme into a western like no other youre ever likely to see again the film is basically about this beast and the savage harshness of the environment and the people who scrape a living from it the photography and the soundtrack are exquisite martin sheens performance is a revelation this film released in the same year as sheens other great performance as willard in apocalypse now hints at his abilities which somehow were never given such a free rein again mores the pity a comparison of the two stories throws up the surprising similarities between them  not least that both films chart a mans journey into his soul in order to find redemption whereas willard is redeemed i will leave it to the viewer to decide if pike is eventually the ending is fabulous in the true sense of the word and very moving be warned altogether this is an extraordinary film,positive,1
if i guess your palabra will you let me go through asks william geld a tim robbins that keeps on acting like if they told him a fantastic joke and he is attempting not to laugh  he is trying to get to a forbidden area the woman stopping him continues blabbering your palabra is carrefour  how did you know the lady asks surprised he answers in the name of wisdom i was hearing when you werent talking   yes this defines the movie this precisely it doesnt matter if carrefour is road conjunction in french or if the future is coldly bureaucratic and mixes languages or if samantha morton has nothing nothing of spanish maria gonzalez being her name in the film with her irish scotish whatever tone  its boring and dull if you fall in believing there are multiple symbolisms you will buy the most bizarre sickening love relationship ever set in a future that may well be in seven seconds i can guess this movies palabra it will be painful,negative,0
a beautiful film cleverly shot with an eye to warera detail and considering it is set during wwii minimal violence  a small cast weaves an emotive journey through the occupation of czechoslovakia the separation from loved ones as the pilots depart for england the separation from the spaniel will touch hearts spitfire scenes love friendship and betrayal the theme of betrayal runs deep through the movie from betrayal of love to betrayal of friendship and finally the betrayal shown by the communist regime to former raf pilots postwar  a desperately sad film all the more so because it is so factually accurate i would recommend it to everyone,positive,1
the major flaw with the film is its uninspired script it plods back and forth between vignettes of betties story and recreations of the klaw short films while the klaw recreations are well done it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety page richards while not an amazing actress does a decent job overall and at times she does bear a remarkable resemblance to bettie also of note is some faithful attention to detail costumes and clothing well done as is some of the set direction the sets are generally sparse and feel stagey but do feel of the era it is sometimes surprisingly well lit and the color palette was clearly thoughtout to give the overall look a vibrant retro feel,negative,0
yes this is an ultralow budget movie so the acting isnt award winning material and at times the action is slowpaced because the filmmakers are shooting longer sequences and not a million instants that then get edited into a movie this film makes up for that with an outstanding script that takes vampirism seriously explains it and develops a full plot out of it aside from the vampire story we get detailed genetics info legal and law enforcement martial arts action philosophical musings and some good metal music kudos go to dylan oleary the directorwritermain actor it is beyond me how this man could have fulfilled all these roles and do them so well i think to appreciate this movie you have to be wellversed in all sorts of themes to see that the writer did a lot of research and knows about all these things there are some great camera work too interesting camera angles and one underwater vampire attack something i havent seen before but which pays homage to the underwater zombie attack in fulcis zombi the casting is good in so far as the sexy female is sexy indeed the main vampire also looks perfect for the role the female victim looks vulnerable my only complaint is that for a low budget horror flick there should have been more nudity if you want to see an original vampire movie with a great story this flick is for you im looking forward to seeing future projects by mr oleary,positive,1
i first saw this movie on mst3k and although i laughed my posterior off at the jokes i dont particularly think this movie was all that bad sure it was a little hard to understand it is quite obviously low budget but it had a very hitchcocklike plot and i can honestly say that when i viewed the nonmst3k version i was genuinely entertained this movie is crying out for a hollywood remake,negative,0
i just watched this movie at the santo domingo international film festival while watching the movie i had the feeling that i have seen a movie with a similar story beforea movie with ray liotta but i cant remember much of it of course this one is a lot more dramatic especially at the end  this is the story emilios life becomes a lie that he can not longer sustain after 20 years lying about his entire life to his wife son and all the people he knows the truth is chasing him and there is nowhere to go  watching emilio make up lies is exiting and funny but after a while you get tired of the same thingthe affair with a young girl was supposed to ad something but it doesnt despite that the movie is still funny exiting and involving either it makes you want to help emilio with his lies or help everybody else catch him i liked the analogies photography and the good performances  75 out of 10,positive,1

even after all these years this remain a perfect movie for me i still remember sitting for a long time in the theater after it was over stunned by the experience overcome by emotion i own the dvd of course is see at least once a year its incomparable and i cannot add much to has already been written about its excellence and beauty so glad others love it as much as i do a note the author of the book on which its based  michael ondatje  was enchanted with the film and is quoted as saying he wished he had thought of some of the lovely scenes written purely for the moviethe way kip invites hana to his side with a trail of small candles and the way he arranges for hana to view the frescoes in the ruined medieval church,positive,1
its hard to believe an action packed jet li movie could be so boring but this was transcendant trash the plot is an amalgam of other hong kong chopsocky flicks the martial arts action is all special effects and no human talent   its a comic book story about a group of superhuman soldiers who are to be killed because theyre mentally unstable one of their number li who holds off an incompetent army to save them and rebuilds a life as a pacifist librarian the saved killers resurface with an austin powers quality plot to take over the world and li sheds his new life to save the world  the version i saw was dubbed and that may have accentuated the cheesiness of the waferthin plot and comicbook 25 cent special effects but i suspect even ninjaturtlewatching 8year olds would have found this juvenile and hollow,negative,0
this early scifi masterwork by herbert george wells with music by arthur bliss is a powerful piece of filmmaking adapted from wells somewhat different work by the author it presents a look at the human future with the subject of periods of war as versus periods of peace the structure is that after a contrastedpair of episodes of normalcy and gathering clouds of war the script allows the war to happen two families the cabells and the passworthys disagree about what may happen passworthy takes a hopeful view of civilizations automatic progress cabell is the thinker the doubter their city everytownobviously london becomes wrecked by a war featuring tanks a magnificent war march by bliss and the end of civilization the second portion finds people living in the wreckage of what had been the city under a boss played with bravura by ralph richardson whose woman lovely margaretta scott is as fascinating a dreamer as he is a concretebound dictator type he is trying to rebuild old wwi airplanes so he can attack a nearby hill tribe to complete his petty kingdom a young scientist complains about having his work continually interrupted demands for planesetceverlastingly this is wells comment on war versus progress the survivors are subject to a plague called the wandering sickness also enter a modern flying machine piloted by the cabell of the first section of the film now part of wings over the world an international scientists coalition who are planning to end warfare forever this flightsuited modernist has fascinating conversations with the boss and his woman their attraction being evident then boss sends up his aircraft against them the scientists come with huge numbers of planes and drop the gas of peace onto the ruins of everytown only the boss dies fighting too hard against the pacifying the film then shows ore being mined and by slow steps being made into the girders of a magnificent new futuristic city of towers in section three a future cabell argues with a future passworthy over the morality of human science passworthy wonders if they have a right to send men to the moon cabell champions mans right to advancement and the need to expand his horizons the son of passworthy and cabells daughter are the astronauts being sent theotocopulos a religiousminded luddite makes a fiery speech on a huge screen in the citys forum and leads an attack on the space gun that is to fire the new rocket free of earths gravity the climax of the plot is the firing of the space gun successfully the denouement and ending is a speech by cabell praising worth and science that is universally considered to be the most profound defense of the mind ever penned it is all the universeor nothing cabell tells passworthy which shall it be as cabell raymond massey gives perhaps his greatest screen performance he is thoughtful compassionate and reasonable a true scientist as the rabblerouser who wants to end the age of science cedric hardwicke is perfect and powerful edward chapman playing passworthy does admirably impersonating the voice of convention and fear the storyline is logical frequently beautiful and always interesting given the nearextinction of mankind the idea of a civilization run by rebuilder scientists is rendered plausible and credible to the viewer this is a triumph for the director william cameron menzies for bliss and for all concerned listen to the dialogue with someone you love within its constructed limits this is a thinking mans drama debating two possible human futuresprogress or its reactionary opposite,positive,1
i saw the film at the nashville film festival it was beautifully done from cinematography to the acting its the story of a father and son and how they come to appreciate each other during a family crisis beautifully written with dialog that never rings false the film showcases the acting talents of paul reiser and peter falk among others in this outstanding cast the film begins with the aging father peter falkis trying to figure out why his wife olympia dukakis has left him the father presents himself unannounced on the doorstep of his son and daughterinlaw the father and son take off the next day to look at some property and end up taking a classic road trip they fish play pool watch a baseball game get drunk get involved in a barroom brawl and dance with strange women but more important they each confront the unspoken tensions that can affect any family its the kind of film that touches the heart and makes one appreciate those who are closest to them,positive,1
i was fortunate to see a screening of this remarkable short film by joshua leonard before its premiere at the 2005 sundance festival in twelve brief but exquisite minutes leonard takes us on a lifechanging journey as he probes one of the most controversial contemporary social and ethical issues facing our society the film embodies elegant direction moving performances and a heart rending story kelli garner and lucas haas radiate as the two lovers and in his first venture into dramatic narrative leonard proves to be a director with a propitious future i feel this short should be expanded into a feature film its difficult to describe talent but as this debut film demonstrates you know it when you see it,positive,1
may be spoilers no doubt one of the best dramas if not the best in the genre ive ever seen is prot an alien or just a crazy bugger this is the question youll be asking yourself all throughout the movie   kevin spacey is simply amazing as is jeff bridges you cant beat this kind of acting plus some humour at times some of kevin spaceys actions in this movie are very funny when he was up in the tree for example and when he was talking to the queen mental patient the way he hid half his face around the wall and just stared  to simply put it right from the start youll be hooked and if you really love dramas you wont be dissapointed  a solid 85,positive,1

while watching blackwater valley exorcism i encountered scenarios and dialog so incredibly bad that i was convinced that this was supposed to be a comedy a few choice bits of dialog worthy of a belly laugh i ate a rabbit i told you she was possessed are you telling me the devil is in my daughter  there are many many more but you must discover these for yourself  if you dare  the story goes off into all sorts of directions and things happen that probably shouldnt and everyone seems to be a perv or psycho of some sort even the priest and i havent even gotten to the bad acting most notable in this area is the fellow playing isabelles father the director must have just told him to act like hes got a stick up his  because thats the general impression one gets  i dont really want to steer anyone away from blackwater valley exorcism because there is entertainment value to be hadfor all the wrong reasons but if youre looking for a decent horror movie that makes sense and is actually scarywell run dont walk,negative,0
yes this movie features a gal named jessica who says everything is evil and she causes trees to land on people too well she only causes a tree to fall once but she does say everything is evil this movie is about a farm that apparently rents out rooms to people but offers little else in the way of entertainment jessica can find things with a stick and she finds the head of an evil guy of course they dont know this until the owner of the farms helpers open the box containing the head the head proceeds to hypnotize everyone it can so it can get to jessica and use her powers to find stuff to help look for his body this movie has an interesting enough story but it plays out very bad here everyone in this flick will get on your nerves at least once,negative,0

slaughter trail is a b western with some grand pretensions but its come down in hollywood history for a most ignominious reason  watching this film with its musical score which can only be described as overbearing i have a feeling what howard hughes was trying to do is recruit a singing cowboy for rko films they already had tim holt who was as reliable a b picture cowboy hero there ever was but he was not a singer i guess hughes saw what money herbert j yates was raking in with roy rogers over at republic and decided hed get one as well  so terry gilkyson who was a very good performer and much better song writer got recruited and sang some of his material which was not his best and worse looked like they were shoehorned into the picture but worse than that theres this annoying chorus which sang a lot of the story and frankly overwhelmed the actors extras even the horses needless to say terry never got to be a singing cowboy but he did write such classics as the bare necessities and dean martins great hit memories are made of this  the plot concerns an inside woman on a stagecoach jewel robbery thats right the outlaws who are gig young myron healey and ken koutnik plant virginia grey in the coach as a passenger which they receive word is carrying some valuable jewels   its a great act grey and young pull off young takes her away from the coach to presumably a fate worse than death and they do properly act out the scene within earshot of the passengers but what he does is slip her the swag last place the authorities might look if she doesnt run off with it  but when they flee the robbery its on tired horses so they stop at a cabin to take some replacement mounts and shoot three navajos who object that puts the navajos back on the warpath didnt help that one of the casualties was chief ric romans brother  thats the situation that captain brian donlevy at the fort has to deal with when the coach and the outlaws arrive there for protection how it all works out is predictable but in a gaudy sort of overproduced way  in fact thats the problem with slaughter trail its a simple no frills b western that got souped up into something almost grotesque  but the real reason slaughter trail entered into history is that this film apparently marks the official beginning of the blacklist originally howard dasilva was to play donlevys part and may have in fact completed his scenes when howard hughes officially fired him for communist sympathies his scenes were completely reshot with brian donlevy in the lead  considering what a fiasco this film turned into im not sure whether donlevy or dasilva ought to have thanked hughes or kicked him in his private preserve,negative,0
grand central murder 1942 dir s sylvan simon   production mgm   this mediocre b mystery was one of only five films released in 1942 with simon as director surely he could have fit another red skelton film or two on his schedule anyway grand central murder is a shameless ripoff of the thin man films minus the wit charm and chemistry of the leads we are treated to a paper thin plot that can barely support its 73 minutes bad acting and weary gags  van heflin and virginia grey play nick and nora charer rocky and butch custer hes a pi and shes his wife and sleuthing partner they engage in humorous banter with each other see its completely different already heflins the only one here who hints at bigger and better things although hes real close to being a jerk in this virginia grey was in another thin man but again let me stress this film is nothing like that one no sir and just in case we start to think that this film is absolutely nothing like another film say the thin man we actually like sam levene pops up as the lead detective whos kind of dim and has to have van heflin subtly direct him toward all the important leads hmmm  quickly the murder is that of bitchy schemer mida king who likes to trade up on rich men until she finds an even richer one shes played by patricia dane whos like a c version of hedy lamarr until she opens her mouth and turns into an f theres a whole array of wacky suspects all with their own motivation for wanting mida dead theres the society type the tough talking dames the thug the exlover and a shady theater impresario tom conway here saddled with the unlikely character name of frankie ciro roman bohnen plays a nervous jittery type something i believe he may have done before millard mitchell plays an idiot cop who in a running gag that wont quit cant stop thinking about the piece of ass hes got waiting for him once this case gets wrapped up thats right millard mitchell swordsman finally in a completely ground breaking method of storytelling something weve never seen before all the suspects are gathered up in one place where they tell their stories as flashbacks to the detective as rocky takes mental notes until eventually the guilty person is compelled to dramatically blurt out a confession  on top of the actual picture being a dud i naively thought going in that there might be a couple of location shots of the actual 1942era grand central but alas no theres merely one very brief shot at the beginning thanks for nothing grand central murder so to sum up a wee bit formulaic but heflin was okay  ½ out of 4,negative,0
i was into the movie right away ive seen the other coen movies with the exception of raising arizona and ive noticed that each of their movies has a color fargo is graywhite lebowski is bright orange and this movie is a pleasant yellow  the bright pleasant qualities of this movie start right away soon the look is accompanied by the great great music its the old folk sound the kind of music that was written during a time when music was enjoyed as a part of day to day life enjoyed by everyone chaingangs church choirs and even prison escapees  now about the prison escapees i dont know what crime their characters could have possibly committed as they are a very very friendly group of guys clooney is fantastic completely nailing his role  go see this as soon as possible i believe that it can be enjoyed by anyone at some level for some reason the theater i was in was full of old ladies and old men and they loved it  youll love it too i promise i was compelled to get my hands on the soundtrack right away,positive,1
for daniel auteuil queen margot was much better for nastassja kinski paris texas was much better the biggest disappointments were from chris menges crisscross and a world apart cannot even be compared with this one and goran bregovic for use of a version of the same musical theme from queen margot for this movie attention to the end of the film if this was an american pop movie i would not feel surprised at all but for a european film with more independent actors and director a similar common approach about child abuse with no original insight is very simpleminded and disappointing there are those bad guys who kidnap and sell the underage people there are those poor children who hate people selling them and wait to be saved by someone and finally there is that big hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from bad guys every character is shown in simple black and white terms the good versus the evil plus from the very beginning i could understand how the story would end is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse i believe that the difficult issue of child molestation and paedophilia is much more complex than how it is portrayed in this not very original movie i think this movie was not disturbing but very disappointing,negative,0

it is great to see a new batch of puppets creating havoc in this series i found this chapter a lot of fun in fact it would probably be my second favorite in the series this movie has very little violence and is only rated pg13 this is notably different from the other rrated puppet master movies which were loaded with gore and violent mayhem the lack of violence does not diminish the fun though this film also has notably better special effects than the last movie in this series good,positive,1
i was a projectionist while in the usaf and remember this movie very well we had just been set up with stereo sound ooooo well it was a big deal in 1959 instructions came with the reels the overture played while the projected curtain image was closed and i followed suit with the theater curtain closed too for intermission the theater curtain was closed and after five minutes i restarted the movie with the projection curtain closed while music used as a curtain call to the second part being the first stereo movie i had ever seen and being such a huge musical production i certainly enjoyed watching it every time i showed it for the run,positive,1
first of all this movie starts out on a really dumb note a 10yearold girl playing around in a moving vehicle decides it would be funny to cover up her moms eyes with her hands and then causes a horrific accident which kills the momduhi am sorry there is positively no 10yearold that dumb the rest of the movie does not get much better after the death of the mother by the apparent dumbest 10yearold on the planet the dad moves the family to genova italy where he is to teach at a local university but here is the clincher he does not speak a word of italian then the little girl has visions of mommy who she killed and often subsequent night terrors which always always end by the father holding and coddling her then we are forced to watch this family continually get lost and then found and then hug and then cry and lost and then found followed by of course more hugging and crying to the point that i was actually wishing for some sort of natural disaster to just wipe all of these vapid ignorant people off the planet do not get me wrong because i love indies but an indie about dumb people and i mean really dumb is simply ridiculous and pointless it is really a shame that this movie was based on such insipid characters wallowing in such retarded scenarios because the locale was interesting,negative,0
this early adam sandler film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period in 1989 his characters constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from sandler than the script the film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films such as big daddy or even the corny billy maddison unfortunately sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent successful and funny manner when this film was made much like his character the majority of the films jokes come from sandler having conversations with himself usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because hes too ugly and cant get women the film is hard to watch too because it doesnt treat itself like a real film sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film often referring to the films low budget or questionable content the film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch i immediately wanted to forget i even saw this film after it was over for fear that if more found out about it it would ruin sandlers career pass this one up at the video store i rented it for free and it was still a waste of time,negative,0
this is a brilliant scifi movie that is very strange in how men and women both view the same film i have talked to many people about the film and almost every guy loved it and said it was brilliantwhile most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid this is the only movie i know of that has such polarized views based on gender perhaps many women just have a lower tolerance for disgusting or depressing plotsbut whatever the cause i have always found this difference fascinating  the film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation headed by charlton heston this is set in the near future and the head of the huge international soylent corporation has been assassinated as the film unfolds you quickly realize this is a terrible and highly inequitable future american society the rich live in gorgeous apartments with security and all the pleasures money can buyincluding furniturea euphemism for paid mistresses that come along with the apartment at the same time the masses are dirt poor unemployed and in many cases living in abandoned cars or apartment hallways overpopulation and smog have taken a severe toll and the future looks awful indeed   why the rich man died and the awful truth he could not live with i really should not discussit could ruin the film for you however the film has a great plot and acting and is superexciting to watch plus it features edward g robinson in his final screen performance as the crusty sidekick to heston though not for the easily depressed or squeamish this is a great scifi film that is allegorical and profound,positive,1
the photography of this bidbudget production is surprisingly bad colors are muddy and brownish and the photography has very 80ish look to it direction and editing are often quite uninspired and tvmovie like too and at first the movie only seems to want to torture its viewers with lurid images of sex and violence hans zimmers score is also a typically simple and bland work of this overrated untalented composer  but if you are willing to watch the movie further you are rewarded with a very moving family story a sort of european version of edna ferbers family epos giant while at first you wonder why clara married this idiotic man even his character gets more depth and more background one can judge him by clara delivers the movies spiritual lesson a great and moving statement set against the terrible happenings in her country her daughter whose lover is a young antonio banderas at the beginning of his international career understands that lesson and ultimately tries to live by it the way the plot was constructed with the ending mirroring the beginning was great the actors all do a great job too i was wondering who is the actress playing blanca all the time but of course it was a really young winona ryder  all in all this movie really made me want to read the book,positive,1
amateurish in the extreme camera work especially overwrought  documentary camera operators neednt spin around all the time  the script is truly inane and the acting is even worse on top of that the story is disjointed and meandering  with some gaping holes in logic at one point the lead wishes to get thrown in jail in order to rub shoulders with suspected alquada operatives and thus get an interview with osama i found the story entirely unbelievable as a result of so many flaws the filmmakerlead role really portrays a rash idiot frat boy the only item of interest really is that the filmmakers did in fact film on location its truly a shame they wasted their opportunity to make something interesting  who financed this crap,negative,0
the exmrs bradford 1936 starring thin man series star william powell this film was released the same year as the second thin man film after the thin man comes very close to duplicating the fun and style of the thin man films but it nonetheless misses still it is a wonderfully fun highly entertaining murder mystery in the same comic vein  is myrna loy missed of course lets not lie however id be hardpressed to name a better substitute than jean arthur and the chemistry between arthur and costar william powell is real and its fun romantic and involving  the story and screenplay by anthonyu vieller and john wynes production company partner james edward grant the angel  the bad man is close to being up there with a thin man effort but lacks a bit of the proper wit and sizzle  while its not in the stratosphere of the thin man movies what else is the exmrs bradford is one of the most entertaining of the dozens and dozens of mysterycomedy whodoneits of the 30s  40s,positive,1
i tend to be inclined towards movies about people who choose to cross the barriers of censorship and express what they really want to express eric bogosians character of barry is like howard stern but much more intelligent the character itself is very fascinating as an oliver stone film i guess i was expecting more the film sags a bit during the third act plus its pretty obvious that talk radio is based on a play with its long dialogue scenes but overall the film works bogosian is great in the lead and the fact that he also wrote the play from which the movie was based on probably helped him if you want to check out one of stones greater films i better suggest you check out jfk or salvador this is not his best work but a good movie nonetheless,positive,1
why because for one reason there has never been a more adorable scene in any film than ann margret singing bye bye birdie at the opening she reprises it again at the ending too in a different mood both wonderful rent it and see even if thats all of it that you watch youll agree im sure  everything about the original was so excellent it just didnt need a remake sorry jason and vanessa gave commendable performances as well as tyne and chynna in fact all the actors and singers in this new version were giving their all but its like trying to improve on casablanca  it just cant be done its even annoying finding yourself comparing the two mentally as you try to appreciate the remake and it just falls short through no fault of the actors,negative,0
in short this movie was awful  i understand its a disney movie which are generally shallow movies with mediocre plots and bad acting however i must say this is the worst of all disney movies with bad acting lots of irritating shrieking teen girlsmy god and an extremely unrealistic plot even as a 12 year old there is no way i would have liked this movie the only way this movie could have been any worse is if they attempted to put it in theaters or tried to sell it in a local video store   do yourself a favor and change the channel before watching this no matter how bored you are on a sunday afternoon,negative,0
maybe my rating should have been a 9 but the film absolutely stunned me when viewing it first time and my latest viewing confirmed my initial belief stylish yes every scene has crafted scoped views terrific angles with a perfect sound side accompanying them  put on top great acting from especially toni servillo garner it with one of the most beautiful and charming women in olivia magnani and a fine plot and you will end up seeing this small masterpiece over and over  paulo sorrentinos next movie lamico de famiglia which is in competition in this years cannes festival will be eagerly awaited,positive,1
this is undeniably the scariest game ive ever played its not the average shooteverythingthatmoves kind of fps which i usually dont care much for but the acceptable gfx interesting weapons and magic great surround soundeffects scryeeee scryeeee and above all incredible atmosphere i love the scrye which enables you at certain places in the games to see or hear events that happened there in the past the only game ive had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere im a great horror fan escpecially of clive barkers stories and movies and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story 910 1 because im no fps fan and perhaps the game was a bit short,positive,1
wasnt sure what to expect from this film i love watching brosnan in any movie hes always good but this was totally different hes a mess and plays being a mess very well in fact he reminded me of myself a few times back in uni  so yes theres not a lot of violence theres not a lot of action but the dialogue is cracking the acting is superb and very refreshing and its pretty funny too  i dont think youll come out of the cinema going wow i was blown away but youll come out smiling having enjoyed a good film cant ask for more than that  oh and if youre lucky some moron will put the adverts reel in wrong and youll get inverted upside down reversed with reversed audio adverts brilliant nothing like watching a jack daniels ad where the drink goes back into the bottle from the glass with a gruff american twin peaks commentary ,positive,1
this isnt a bad movie its fun to watch for the first time however it has absolutely no replay value at all when you try to watch it again it gets so boring you have to turn it off i give this movie a 6 out of 10,negative,0
this is one of those movies when you are watching it you wonder whether it is documentary or fiction after the movie ramin bahrani answered many questions and we learned that the movie has a script  bahranis camera is silent he is not judgmental he almost erases director from the movie by purpose background is not organized to make the picture pretty however dont get me wrong there is a lot of preparation for this movie starting on personal level being the part of environment being to be ignored when you film  main character is a real actor in every sense  i would like to thank all crew for this movie showing us another country within nyc i strongly suggest it if you like stories of others  bora kizilirmak,positive,1
a friend and i went to see this movie we have opposite opinions about fujimori but after watching this movie we agree on the following the easiest way to have an inaccurate documentary is to make it about a foreign country in which you were not present when the events happened no matter how talented or how much you invest in the film if you are truly looking to learn about another countries history watch something made by natives of that country otherwise you wont be able step away from your bubble and those who try to force their views and opinions about something to which they dont belong are really abusing their power to make it even worse the director chose to not talk about the embarrassing involvement of the cia with fujimoris regime she decides to evade dealing with the only subject for witch her country has much to explain to peruvians but this is not surprising because both the director and the cia are violating the sovereignty of peru by trying to affect the democratic processes at very different levels of course  if the director was really interested in helping peru she would have financed a native to make the documentary in any case there are numerous peruvian made documentaries films and books about the subject such include ojos que no ven dias de santiago montesinosfujimori las dos caras de la misma moneda montesinos poderoso caballero etc the director of the fall of fujimori should spend her time analyzing the numerous problems in her own country or at least the involvement of her country in the matters of other nations,negative,0
if not the best movie ever made babettes feast is certainly among the most loving this is a wonderful exploration of the meaning of artistry generosity loyalty and grace humor is mixed with tender longing characters are treated with searching honesty but also deep respect there are meditations here on memory fate old age and faithfulness marvellous camera work by cinematographer henning kristiansen seldom have wrinkled faces looked so luminous in the candlelight the meal is accompanied by delicious period music brahms mozart and simple folk hymns enjoy this feast for the eyes and the spirit for as the general says mercy and truth have met together and righteousness and bliss shall kiss one another,positive,1
dig i would say to anyone even if you dont like metallica to see some kind of monster it is a spinal tap type documentary about one of the biggest bands in the world acting like mental kids during a breakdown of sorts its fun and fascinating along the same lines comes dig a film about the dandy warhols and the brian jonestown massacre two portland bands who start off a kind of music scene in there home town only for one of the bands to become huge and one to fall by the wayside into the musical history books right from the start the two bands pull in opposite directions just on their ability to make decisions whether good or bad filmed over seven years and at times painful to watch we see the dandys meteoric rise to fame thanks to that vodaphone ad and the jonestown seminal fall from scene instigators to bickering wannabes as the bands become more disjointed the friendships are stretched tension tight and at several points snap into arguments and even on stage fights all of this is half funny and half tragic and believe it or not is perversely watch able like i said at the beginning you can watch the metallica film even if you have no interest in the band dig on the other hand is slightly different and is more enjoyable and a whole lot easier to watch if you have a passing interest in either band still a good film and more a testament to not be in a band than encouraging that as a career path dig is a mad ride on rock and rolls coat tails and a fine example of the pitfalls and pleasures of being or wanting to be famous,positive,1
this was a disgrace to the game farcry i had much expectations but all ended up in a nightmare besides the bad acting the visual effects stunts the plot even the humor used in the movie was an absolute flop the movie is not worth watching at all the funniest part was when the girl comes and kiss jack in order to give him the key to the cuffs guess the she got the keys to handcuffs all the time i hope some good director will make a remake of this fantastic game into a movie someday and i they will invest some good cash to get the visual effects right and the scenaries right as well as the acting right but till then dont waste time by trying to watch this movie because it will surely make you go mad specially if you are a farcry lover,negative,0
i myself feel this film is a rare treasure not only is it the beginning of shirley temples career but a rare look on how our society has changed you have to understand certain things we today would view as sexual back then would be considered innocent for example the parents of the children in the film as well as the many parents who took their children to see this movie saw this as just children mimicking adults most people didnt think of anyone viewing children sexually attractive other than teenage boys lusting over teenage girls to them it wasnt sexual mind you this was before we had internet tv etc most sex crimes werent openly brought up occasionally there would be a whisper about the kid with the funny uncle but that was often all that came of it yes very sad but it is kinda sad today for even i too can see this film as anything other than what it was intended innocent and funny when i saw shirley dance like that and the boys eye balling her yes i felt disturbed i have to remind myself the time this took place those children didnt know what sex was the parents knew that both those of the children in the movie and those watching it the thought may not have even entered their minds in the eyes of the average adult back then this was no more sexual then if shirley was playing house even today kids will enter beauty contest many dressed up extremely maturely for a three yr old however the child is merely pretending i dont blame the child for wanting to act like an adult or the old movies that display this in all honesty our media has made a lot of things seem back then seem sick and wrong this sometimes can be for the best but i truly believe this movie isnt one of them it gives a rare look of an innocent mentality that we have long lost,positive,1
if you want to see a film with no guns blood sex shouting angry people hero bad guys  girls or even clumsy love words and you want to see a film in which every shot has the meaning of love  this one is a must see film for me ive been waiting for a film like this all of my life,positive,1
ok before i get into this lets go ahead and get the warning out of the way this movie is the quintessential cinematic definition of sleaze there are movies out there that can definitely outshock or outdisgust this movie that have way more artistic validity than can be said for this turd of a film so what makes it so sleazy lets take a closer look at wet wilderness for a moment  made in 1974 for practically nothing this roughie has no real genuine plot to speak of other than portraying what would happen if a family went into the wilderness to relax and spend a day while being accosted by a fat dude in a ski mask wielding a machete looking for kicksthe kind that end up with everyone being forced to have sex with each other while being systematically murdered by the masked creep so those sensitive to themes dealing with incest are encouraged to look elsewhere then to really either add a level of surrealism or just demonstrate a complete ineptness for the art of filmmaking the daughter of the group runs away after being forced to have sex with her brother and finds a random black dude  tied to a tree branch that fat sumbitch left me here for 3 days with virtually no explanation whatsoever he is savedor is he of course not they are caught before they can escape where our killer forces them to have sex as well while forcing the mother to join in ending up with a dead black dude courtesy of a hatchet through the chest when all is said and done then our killer forces the daughter and mother to give him oral sex when one of the women grabs the macheteand the movie abruptly ends just like that no warning no tiedup loose endsits simply over now there might be a proper ending to this film i honestly do not know but i have only seen the extremely crude alpha blue archives version their version appears to have the ending either cut out completely or this is how it ends if this was intentional then in filmmaking 101 im sure there is some sort of rule of thumb on how to end a film but it shouldnt be done like this fans of the film psycho should rejoice upon hearing the soundtrack music as its all through the film id be willing to bet no rights were licensed or anything also even though this is a violent film theres not a hell of a lot of it so gorehounds will find nothing of real use here none of the violence is graphically shownonly the results one of the victims gets stabbed with a machete right above the vagina area also the sex is some of the ugliest sex ive ever seen the interesting thing about this film is its too ugly a film to work as an effectively erotic porno or turn on anyone but those with a tendency to like things sleazy nasty and ugly but not violent enough to garner any real notoriety with those looking for something really brutal like cannibal holocaust or other flicks like that the only notorious thing about this steaming pile is that violence was added to an adult film a fairly new concept at that time especially when you consider than porn chic was all the rage and the grindhouses that filled 42nd street played stuff like this to a most jaded group of porn mavens this wasnt and isnt mainstream porn at all  if you were in filmmaking school and there was a list of moviemaking donts this film would be a shining example of that lesson this cinematic swill demonstrates what happens when cerebrally challenged filmmakers are given a budget in this case probably about 142cuz it looks it and ignore all the donts and turn them into dosyes this film is that bad one more thing those who get offended by racial epithets are also encouraged to watch something else the black man in the film is constantly being verbally abused about his color and the killer is obviously racist but there was no political correctness in the early 70s im not sure a film like this could be made today  to be honest this wont shock anyone or titillate anyone but those who get off on ugliness actually i got bored the sex is so ugly and mundane its hard to watch with any sense of eroticism so if you chance this you will thank god for the fast forward button the acting if you want to call it that is amateurish at best i mean its even bad for porno with not one reason to care about anyone or anything in this if you just gotta see this anyway then download it as youll really feel like a heel if you buy this some things are simply that worthlessand wet wildernes is the only thing more unpleasant than watching this film would be watching this film sitting in a theater and looking around at the others in attendance watching it too and suddenly feeling unsafe probably not societys greatest collection of thinkers and intellectuals but if youre up for some stupid yet sleazy porn garbage give it a crack its 54 minutes and yet it feels much longer crackheads would love this then again maybe theres something wrong with me for seeking this out in the first placelol caveat emptor sleazelovers,negative,0
aint it hilarious when an average schmo leading a pathetic life suddenly has something outrageously magical happen to him turning his life upside down and causing him to learn a few valuable lessons along the way that formula never gets old does it its such a sure fire way to make a classic film just look at major hits like liar liar and big this must have been rob schneiders line of thinking when he made semisuccessful deuce bigalow male gigolo and followed it with the animal since ive already traced the plot through sarcasm allow me to color it in more schneider plays a loser cop whos suddenly involved in a tragic accident but is saved through surgery by a loopy veterinarian who loads him up with animal parts causing him to whinny like a horse at inappropriate times run like a cheetah etc this movie is slightly more likable than other schneiderstarring flicks such as another lame sameplot followup the hot chick but it almost feels like they want audiences to hate it by casting a reality tv star as the romantic lead colleen haskell from survivor and inserting a cameo by norm macdonald my favorite scene just does not exist sorry  nothing memorably good except the production value i just want to end this review by saying that slight references to other movies in a movie can be okay but when it comes to lines being delivered the exact same way you can do it theres a word for that  milking actually heres another word  cheap,negative,0
this film is definitely an odd love story though this film may not be much to shout about nicole kidman carries the film on her own the rest of the cast could quite easily be forgotten though ben chaplin does do quite a good job of hertfordshire life with shots of st albans  hemel hempstead town centre depicting the true essence of the area what starts outlooking like a regular episode of the popular british tv seriesheartbeat soon turns into a gritty gangster getaway action flicknothing truly memorable happens in this simple small film and thus endsup as fairly decent weekend entertainment a good one to watch and if you like the hero john are lonely thirty something you may find something to identify with in his character,positive,1
this film rocksso hard  the cameosthe drug referencesthe sharingthe lovethe rocking when jack and kyle first met in tim robbins actors gang theater company years ago who knew that such a legacy of awesome music and hilariousness would ensue all that door to door rocking paid off  although anyone who enjoys classic rock will get a major kick out of this film i would definitely recommend renting the original 6 hbo episodes at your local video store before going to see the film in the cinema theyre on the tenacious d masterworks dvd which is available for rent at pretty much every video store there are some inside jokes in the film that refer to these earlier episodes that will add something more enjoyable to the overall viewing experience,positive,1
there is so much not to like about this show its hard to know where to start unlikeable characters horrible plot lines terrible writing and terrible acting dont even get me started on the obnoxious theme music  on top of all that the show is out of touch with us audiences due to the heavy canadian references all throughout it oh say derek will you be going to queens college in the fall how have you bean we should go oot   granted other shows are filmed in canada for financial reasons like stargate atlantis but while those shows may have suffered from some annoyances like rodney calling a zpm a zedpm the show didnt focus on life in canada  mtv is running degrassi another show based on the experiences of the canadian teenager during daytime hours when no one is watching to fill time most teens are at school when it airs id wager its for the same reason shows that focus on teenage life in canada dont translate well to a us audience  this show should be canceled and the remaining masters burned in a furnace,negative,0
imagine a film the complete opposite of lawrence of arabia instead of having an all male cast it has an all female cast instead of being set in the barren deserts of arabia it is set in the bulging metropolis of new york city and instead of it being one of the greatest films ever made it is one of the most pointless boring and forgettable  the film concerns mary haines meg ryan a perfect wife and mother the envy of all others in her high society manhatten social circle she is painted as a women bearing the weight of the world on her shoulders despite the fact she needs a live in nanny and housekeeper to cope with her one child but i dont want to be too hard on her mary does all this whilst taking a liassezfaire attitude towards the fashion designing job her father has given her this idyllic lifestyle cannot last forever though and things start to crash in a very real way  marys husband is cheating on her and her father fires her for not working hard enough she is quite naturally upset and breaks down a little  mary needs to bounce back though for the sake of her impressionable young daughter and for herself she does this through rehab hair straightening and designing her own line of clothes though amazingly for this kind of film not a montage mary succeeds her daughter loves her her mother loves her her friends love her and her husband decides he loves her now she decides to take her cheating husband back after realising it was her fault he cheated as she didnt dote on him enough  the films one saving grace is that it doesnt go down the all men are evil route,negative,0
i first saw signs of life on pbs as an american playhouse presentation its a wonderfully written ensemble production with terrific performances by michael lewis as joey and vincent donofrio as his brother daryl arthur kennedy in one of his last roles is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close the rest of the cast which includes beau bridges kathy bates and marylouise parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their characters  the direction is subtle and effective ive watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it a beautiful piece of filmmaking,positive,1
villa rides 1968 turns out to be something of a big disappointment and even though sam peckinpah had a hand in the screenplay along with robert towne it still emerges as a leadenly written movie dryly directed by the undistinguished buzz kulik firstly top billed yul brynner as pancho villa is wrong for the part hes not charismatic enough to play the great mexican revolutionary his one note performance lacks the fire and gusto anthony quinn or gilbert roland could have brought to the role brynner simply looks like a russian aristocrat dressed up like a mexican bandit who is in the middle of the mexican revolution instead of the russian one also second billed robert mitchum is totally wasted in the picture his part as a biplane flying ace lobbing homemade bombs from the air in the cause of the revolution is a poorly written meager role that could have been played by any minor star mitch hasnt a decent line in the entire movie and brings to ones mind his other mexican revolution picture the far superior bandido 1956 which unfortunately nobody seems to have any interest in releasing on dvd besides lacking any kind of style villa rides also suffers badly without the presence of a female star there is starlet grazia buccella as a young mexican girl who gives mitchum the glad eye but her casting is merely perfunctory someone like claudia cardinale or jean peters could have perhaps added a couple of badly needed notches to the faltering story line  there are a couple of good action scenes in the movie but a couple of good action scenes do not a movie make and the less than perfect panavision picture quality plus the over repetitive maurice jarre theme tune doesnt help matters  as is paramounts wont there are no extras  not even a trailer yup a disappointing movie and dvd presentation that could have been and should have been a whole lot better,negative,0
like the previous commentator on this film i too found myself in tears at times during this movie sometimes one wonders how a film of such aweinspiring awfulness comes into existence from the first moment when our protagonist wakes up in his new york apartment from a dream of subway trains intercut with galloping horses what irish emigrant hasnt had that one its clear we are in trouble and it doesnt get much better  whisked back to 1950s ireland we enter a world where everybody speaks without intonation and exclusively on the topic of the irish civil war schoolchildren go to school to learn about the civil war the drinkers in the pub divide themselves according to their civil war allegiances remembrances are carried out for those who died in the civil war the town is divided between those who believe we should remember and those who want to forgetthe civil war every glance and conversation is dripping with meaning that traces back to the civil war  the blurb on the videocover of broken harvest suggests that the film is a parable of the troubles in modern ireland the only parallel which strikes me is that in present day dublin conversation is indeed dominated by one topic house prices if its intention is to offer some sort of insight into irelands obsession with its past it fails miserably it is striking how few irish films have dealt with the irish civil war and its legacies however it will take a film of a great deal more subtlety and intelligence than this one to tell us anything about the lasting effects of such a traumatic event on the nations psyche  for those american viewers who have suggested the film evokes the atmosphere of 1950s ireland it doesnt 1950s ireland was a horrible poverty stricken pit of sexual repression and misery from which young people fled in their droves however there was more than one topic of conversation,negative,0
even though this movie starts off with the usual something goes wrong spacecraft crashes people are stranded etc it still pulls off and introduces the viewer to some new ideas riddick is somewhat of a badass convict and has modified his eyes so he is able to see in the dark which is a much sought after ability due to the situation the shipcrew and he gets in the cutting in the movie is very good and emphasizes the mystique that shrouds around the antihero and male protagonist riddick the story in pitch black is as already mentioned to some extent very unoriginal and dissatisfied but the clipping and cutting in the movie blended with some surprising elements which has been added to the story helps it to still support itself very well and one is afterward left behind with a hybrid feeling of satisfaction and hunger for more vin diesel acts really well in the role as riddick and even though his character is a hardcore tough survivor he still takes morale decisions almost on the verge of good but that does not mean his decisions do not turn in his favor at the very end why destroy an already perfect reputation all in all this is a very good movie though not perfect the story seems very unoriginal at the surface but underneath it shines with enough originality to entertain some scenes has that wow factor while it as a whole is a bit better than average it could maybe be described as a cult movie and it is definitely a recommendation for people who wants a spiced up scifi story blended with some minor psychological moments and an intriguing protagonist namely riddick,positive,1
i thought that i wrote a comment on this movie before but i cant find it on here anyway i am writing it again i accidentally found this movie from my colleges library collections it was free to watch so why not  i am certainly glad that i watched it i love this movie i have seen a few russian movies before most of them have serious topics i am surprised that this was one a good comedy i had a great laugh while watching it and this is a movie that i want to buy this thing is so funny and they are not just silly funny those plots were very original and well thought so they dont seem to be silly at all i am surprised that this movie didnt attract many viewers this is a classic that you can watch it over and over  those actors were also very authentic their acting are real not faked if you havent watched it go get a copy soon definitely recommended,positive,1
when sabrina first came onto our screens i was about 12 and therefore spent my teenage years watching the teenage witch get into all kinds of weird predicaments  it was always one of my favourite programmes the witchy feeling of sixties sitcom bewitched but this time the character was cooler i always liked sabrina because she was smart she was also friendly and easy going which made her enjoyable to watch the characters at the beginning were great harvey jenny libby the quizmaster salem and mr poole my personal fave shame he left so early on hilda and zelda her aunts started off ok but then became irritating  i liked mr kraft too as he was always that little bit closer to discovering sabrinas secret what i loved about the first three series was the original ideas the discovering of the family secret and learning new spells but as it went on it became more predictable too many characters came and left such as valerie dreama and brad and then they decided to do sabrina at college which ruined it for me  sabrina became selfabsorbed at college there was less magic no spell book no aunts living with her and roxie miles and morgan were annoying  the last series was boring and i only watched to see what happened in the end not having hilda and zelda seemed wrong somehow and miles was gone just like that the last episode made me feel a lot better though spoilerhaving sabrina end up with harvey on her wedding day to dullard aaron was great overall a great programme if you forget the poor last two or three series which reminded me of so many teen shows magical,positive,1
in print this is one of the greatest short stories ever written brought brilliantly and poetically to the screen by this fatherson team working together sadly for the first and last timeit is fitting that john huston should end his career on a high note by bringing the work of one of his favorite authors to the screen in what is easily the best joyce screen adaptation huston made a career of adapting great works of literature to film usually quite successfully it is sad and somewhat puzzling that tony huston pretty much began and ended his career in film by adapting what would be his fathers final project and picking up a welldeserved oscar nomination in the process  i once had the privilege of sitting in the company of the great screenwriterplaywright horton foote who cited this film as one of his favorites in recent years at the time it was still a fairly recent release as a rather prolific screenwriter himself and a brilliant screen adapter of his own works as well as great authors such as faulkner steinbeck and harper lee he was obviously impressed with tony hustons first time effort and possibly equally puzzled by his lack of output since then if anyone has insights to share on the topic id be interested to hear more,positive,1
i just viewed murder at the vanities in the newlyreleased universal precode set and i was amazed at how much i enjoyed the vehicle end to end most of the other commentators have covered the story a murder mystery within a musical but i wanted to add a few additional notes brisson and carlisle are relatively bland compared to even most of the minor players and neither one really seems to have the proper voice for what theyre singing carlisle being a trained opera singer brisson a bit wobbly on some of his high and low notes the great victor mclaglen and jack oakie play well off each other with an excellent sense of timing that keeps the ball rolling between musical numbers yes lucille ball and ann sheridan are vanities girls but lets not forget the splendid jazz singer ernestine anderson in the ebony rhapsody number gail patrick makes one of her early appearances sounding a bit like eve arden patrick would go on to become the executive producer of the perry mason tv series then theres jessie ralph as the wardrobe mistressyoull spot her also in david copperfield as aunt peggoty and the bank dick the music is very goodbrisson introducing the standard cocktails for two in two different scenes sweet marihuana with barely clad peyote button girls in the background blood dripping on one chorines white skin was wonderfully chilling the ebony rhapsody with duke ellingtons orchestra and a bevy of beautiful dancers both black and white mixing it up and i believe this is one of the only early musicals to feature such a mixand the costumes leave nothing to the imagination,positive,1
